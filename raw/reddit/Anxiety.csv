"Professor here, if you have missed class, please come back. We aren’t mad at you.","Hello, I’ve read a lot of posts recently about folks missing classes and feeling too anxious to come back. Don’t worry. We would much rather you come back to our classes than continue to miss. We teach because we care about you individually. We care about what’s going on in your lives. I know it’s easy to see professors as these omnipresent overlords but know that we are human and we have definitely been in your position before.

1. Anxiety makes it hard to go to sleep 2. Depression makes it hard to get out of bed 3. Drink coffee for a boost 4. Caffeine makes anxiety worse 5. Repeat,Just one of the hellish cycles that anxiety gets me caught in. Can anyone else relate?
How to order from subway?,I've been pretty much suffering from social anxiety all my life...but subway just gives me chills. I just can't never gather the guts to order from a subway. Can someone explain me how to place an order at subway without being judged?
"I was thinking why this sub has a lot more upvotes than comments, realized people are too anxious to comment,lol","edit: welp reaching over 2000 upvotes makes me anxious to post anything here again, so I guess this will be my only post :p"
"hey if you know someone has anxiety PLEASE DON'T TEXT THEM ""WE NEED TO TALK"" AND THEN NOT REPLY FOR 7 HOURS FUCK",just needed to get that out there
"I don't think people realize how much strength it takes to pull your own self out of a dark place mentally. So if you've done that today or any day, i'm proud of you.","EDIT: I heard the quote somewhere, doesn't belong to me. :)"
Anxiety is having a wonderful day ahead of you but not enjoying it because you’re thinking about that 2 minute phone call you’ll have to make in five days.,"Edit: sometimes I just feel so alone, sometimes more than 1.5k people relate to me. Thank you. "
Anxiety is waking up 3 hours before your alarm and not being able to fall back asleep because you're worried you won't be able to fall back asleep.,Thanks brain.
"I’m an italian OCD and anxiety sufferer, and I’m here to tell you that it’s going to be okay.","I know you probably don’t believe me, but it WILL get better and easier. I know it sounds scary when governments start to put out all of those limitations and lockdowns, but it’s for the better. 

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

We have the amazing power of adaptation. Every tool you have learned to cope with your anxiety will come in super handy, and you’ll see how strong you are with them. Sometimes I imagine COVID-19 as the boss level of anxiety, and it gets me super pumped lol. It makes me want to kick its ass so much.

It’s a wild ride but if us italians are riding it out, you’ll ride it out as well!
Sending you all a giant hug. We’re in this shit together.

And please, remember this pro tip: check what is necessary to check on the news. And that means check only what YOU as a citizen need to do. Numbers will go super high, then super low, then high and low again... it’s a pain that you really don’t need in your everyday life. If it’s impossible for you to resist the urge, have a trusted loved one tell you the necessary things you need to know: if there are new limitations, if you can go to school / work , what you should do with your hands etc.

EDIT: thank you so much for the awards, I really never thought this would blow up. There are so many comments, I’ll try my best to answer to the most. But as for all the compliments, THANK YOU!! You are all really sweet. You’ve joined the fight with us, you are not alone :)."
Anyone else more anxious about COVID restrictions being lifted than they were about them being implemented?,"I have adapted really well to the social isolation and working from home thing. I have a great routine now (way more balance with work/life/health than I did pre-covid) and love having more time to spend with my pets, reading & contemplating. All the zoom meetings for work and maybe 1-2 virtual “catch ups” with friends every week are adequate for me socially. 

However when I think about how I’ll have to go back to my typical 8-5 grind with a 2 hour commute on top of those hours, I feel super anxious. Anybody else in a similar boat? 

Note I’m not saying I hope covid continues to thrive, I know it has had a severely negative impact on many people. I am just anxious at the thought of returning to what was my “normal life” that I hated."
"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but, unclench your jaw and relax your shoulders.","Yes that’s it, relax, you deserve it. :)

Edit: every time I get a notification for my post, it reminds me to do this lol."
Does anyone else constantly feel like they’ve done something wrong after social interactions?,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I’ve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don’t have a bad relationship with any of them. I don’t consider myself anti social. I’ve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it’s all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they’ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn’t worry about it, but for some reason I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

EDIT:  I never expected this post to get the response that it did. I want to reply to everyone, but don’t want to be a broken record either. I’m sorry you all are suffering with this as well and I hope we all find some relief someday. It really helps me to know I’m not alone in these feelings. I hope knowing you’re not alone brings you some relief as well. And I’m nobody special, but if anyone ever needs to talk or share experiences I’m here."
Anybody else ever find themselves staying up late purely to make it feel like there’s more time between now and tomorrow??,I have work in the morning and my brain is like “if you stay up til 1 then you have another half an hour to relax before going to sleep & waking up anxious for work”
I DID IT.,"I FUCKING DID IT. 

I have extremely bad driving anxiety and I have been stressing about this trip for months and today was the day. I drove 2 hours ON THE HIGHWAY!!!! I WENT LIKE 100 km/hr!!!!! and then 2 hours back (in the dark!!!) !!!!!!!

I bought myself a whole pizza when I got there and SMASHED IT BC I FUCKING DESERVED THAT SHIT hahahahah

It’s literally 1:45 am and I’m so fucking happy. If you’re reading this and you’re too scared to do something, DO IT. On the other side of fear is freedom. I feel like I just beat a boss level.

"Does anyone feel depressed that their anxiety has kept them from experiencing major parts of a ""normal"" life?","I barely went out with friends when I was in high school. Always heard about my friends going out to parties, but I never went to one myself. In university, I avoided going out with friends, and mostly kept to myself. At the time, I didn't realize I had anxiety. But now, when I look back, knowing that I had anxiety and depression, it makes me really sad that I missed out on socializing and parties. Even though deep down I feel like I would have felt uncomfortable at them anyways. Not sure if that makes sense or not. It's sort of feeling like I wish I could have enjoyed them even though the reality is that I probably wouldn't have enjoyed them much even if I had had the opportunity to socialize more."
"[UPDATE] after almost canceling a job interview due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!","I GOT AN OFFER!!!!!!

I went back to pessimism and expecting the worst after a few days of not hearing back, but I did today, and they offered me the job!!!!! Higher pay, almost double the PTO, amazing benefits... I’M JUST SO EXCITED!!!!

Thank you so so so much to everyone that gave such kind words of support and encouragement. This has been a HUGE life changing step for me and it’s amazing to be able to share it with all of y’all.

Edit: I promise I’m done bragging on myself after this but I just negotiated a (slightly, not by much but still!) higher salary as well! I’m over the moon, I can’t believe I’m me and I did this haha.

I'm trying so hard from crying and deleting this post. I've probably wrote 50 different sentences and deleted them thinking it's not good enough and that people would be upset. I really don't want to but I got to try. It's been 15-20 minuets since I started to type all of this  and I'm really  scared on posting it. Please don't be too hard on me...

"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.","Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

I don’t even want to answer texts from my friends that are back in town, because that means we need to get together. 

Ex: I had to send a mass email to a few organizations to see if they wanted to arrange a presentation with my volunteer group. I’ve already received a voicemail and an email in response.

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

"My biggest fear is that my anxiety will always keep me in my ""safe zone"" causing me to live a life of mediocrity that I will one day really regret.",Currently trying to tackle this issue but its my biggest challenge. 
"Anxiety isn’t cute, anxiety is thinking someone died because they haven’t messaged you in a day.",Either that or they hate you. 
Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh."
anyone else constantly wondering if their shortness of breath is due to anxiety or corona,"Thank you guys for all of your responses. This makes me feel a lot better about my current situation, and I hope you all feel a bit less alone after reading through these responses."
I always want to post in this subreddit but I know I’ll feel like a failure if I don’t get upvotes.,"Does this happen to anyone else? I actually think this sub is a great tool for cathartic sharing among people with anxiety, and I know I could derive some benefit in allowing myself to post more. But there’s some silly irony in me thinking “Well what if this gets ignored? What if people think this is dumb or invalid?”. Even right now as I type this I think “Oh yeah this is so witty and meta, this will definitely get me to the top of the sub” which is so in line with every obsession I have about being special, being great, being loved, etc — and my inability to just do or enjoy the small things for what they are without some greater sense of meaning. 

EDIT: Ha, this blew up, how poetic. The joy or validation I feel from the upvotes doesn’t match the negativity I would have felt if it went unnoticed, which is good to know!

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""  
- Bertrand Russell, A Free Man's Worship"
"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?","Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don’t mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

Take care of yourselves, everyone >< Gonna go take a relaxing bath after reading the replies here"
I JUST CALLED INTO A PIZZA PLACE!!!,"I'm still shaking. Making phone calls gives me the biggest anxiety. I asked whether it's not too late to have it delivered into my area. Person said no but that I'd have it better to order it online anyway. So it was a shorter and less complicated phone call than I was preparing for but that doesn't change the fact that I did it! I dialed the fuck out of that number, fucking killed it!! EAT A DICK, ANXIETY.

Edit: I make a phone call and get my first gold in the same day?! This literally made my whole month. Your guys' support, advice and kind words on this post have been overwhelming. I did not expect it to blow up so much but I'm grateful it did. I'm so motivated and inspired by your words that I'm now less scared to push myself even further. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. "
Anyone else anxious and scared about lockdown being lifted and having to attain responsibility and normality again?,"I've never had much of an issue with being in quarantine, I liked being able to stay inside and watch television or listen to music all day.

"""Trusting your gut feeling"" is a lot more difficult when you have anxiety.","I often hear that when your gut tells you something, it's usually right. But how does this work when you're anxious about every little thing? I never know if it's a true warning or just my anxiety making something out of nothing. It's like my gut is crying wolf all the time. "
Does anyone else get super sensitive to noise when they’re anxious?,Whenever I’m feeling really anxious my hearing seems super sensitive and sounds/voices can be overwhelming. When I get like this I get super irritated by people talking and loud noises. Does this happen to anyone else?

"Do anyone else just want the day to end, but don't want to go to sleep because you don't want tomorrow to start?","There have been so many nights where I just can't fall asleep because that makes tomorrow come ""faster""."
"Im not stupid, im not unintelligent, im not slow, im just anxious.","
Thats all I wanted to say really."
Do you guys need constant reassurance that everyone is not mad at you?,"I always assume the worst. And now that we’re have to practice social distancing it’s making it a lot easier to think negative thoughts. I know they are irrational but sometimes my mind just convinces me that they are true. I feel like I need constant reassurance from my friends so I know they aren’t mad me even though it makes no sense for them to be mad at me because there has been no actual conflict between us. I guess since I haven’t physically seen any of my friends it has gotten really had to stay on track mentally. Like before of this quarantine started we use to spend almost all day everyday together, now everything is through text and for me, I would rather talk to someone face to face so I know what their tone of voice is. Sometimes my mind just thinks really stupid things and it’s really hard to stop it. Does anybody else feel this way too?"
I think I prefer depression over anxiety,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‘Objectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start. And change that baseline of feeling good to a higher norm’."
The side of anxiety most people don’t understand.,"Started a new job about a month ago, finally received my embroidered shirts that I’m required to wear. Go to put one on and it doesn’t fit, none of them do. Now I’m having to wear the plain t-shirt into work until they can order me more. I woke up 2 1/2 hours early to make sure I was ready. Now I’m sitting in a parking lot nearby being so nervous to have to tell my boss they don’t fit. Anxiety is having to go through every scenario possible that can happen when I go back in. My body hurts physically and I feel nauseous over this. All over a simple fix that will take him 5 seconds to handle in reality, but my brain doesn’t work that way. This sucks ☹️"
does anyone get extremely anxious when people around them are angry or mad?,"so, i have noticed that whenever someone around me is in a bad mood especially if they are frustrated or angry, i get this feeling like i just wanna hide and lock myself in a box. i usually rush to my room, turn off all the lights to calm myself, put on my earphone and play the loudest music to drain out any loud voices. i think this comes from my traumatic childhood because my parents were always screaming at each other. anyways, does anyone do this? i need some feedback cuz im pretty sure i have anxiety but i dint wanna diagnose myself too early."
You are strong for getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. You are brave for doing things even though they scare you or make you anxious.,And You are amazing for trying and holding on no matter how hard life gets.
I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,"SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

Edit 2: Holy Moley the amount of encouragement and props is insane. You all are awesome. Thank you."
"Just a little reminder unclench you’re jaw, relax your shoulders, and breathe.","You are safe, and not alone ❤️"
Wish people realised anxiety is physical too.,"I literally get such a jittery weird feeling in my body so many times a day whenever I'm anxious. Like I can't describe it but it's definitely not good. Almost like something is pinching on my organs. And the worst is when I have to wake up in the morning, it's almost like someone has placed added extra weights to my body. I literally can't get up from my bed! I try to force myself up,but I just can't. I just lay there staring at the ceiling, thinking about what I'll do with my day, get anxious about what if I won't be able to be productive today, then getting anxious about how I wasted some time the previous day, then overthinking it all nd wanting to just kill myself. I hate it."
"You ever get so anxious that you start writing a comment and literally can't get yourself to send it, even though it's on Reddit and Reddit is anonymous, and nobody would care?","Like, really? What is happening to me today?  


  
Sorry if this is cringey, but I really didn't think this would be the post to get me past 1k karma... Probably not a good thing, but thank you guys."
Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?,"I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.

I've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to ""act"" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  
My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.

Has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it? Sorry if this was long and ""venty"" I just feel trapped in my head! *Takes brain out and throws it out the window* 

Thank you :-)

Edit: wow thank you everyone for all of your comments. It means a lot that we can share and relate here, to know we are not alone on this. "
"Please forgive your mind/body for the anxiety, it's doing the best it can given the circumstances.","I think I needed to hear that today, so I thought it might help you too.

A week later edit:

Wow I didn't expect this to get so much attention! I wish I saw this sooner. I usually come here when I'm feeling anxious and tonight... well, tonight has been kind of a doozie. Thank you all, seeing all these responses has actually stopped me from shaking so badly. I love you all for your strength and kindness <3 

I appreciate the comments and upvotes (and the gold goodness me!), I'm really glad I could help someone else. This stuff sucks. You've helped me a lot tonight, thank you <3"
Does anyone else feel like their brain just literally searches for any reason to worry?,"I swear if the source of my anxiety gets resolved, I just immediately find something else to worry about. 

I just want to know what it feels like to not worry sometime 😖"
"Anyone else sometimes get a huge burst of confidence, but then feel like absolute shit later?","Idk if this is the right place to post this, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest. 

Every other week it seems, maybe for a day or two, I feel like I can do anything, like i'm on top of the world. However, after a day, everything comes crashing down and I feel like shit, almost like I didn't deserve that boost of confidence. It has just been a viscous cycle. 

UPDATE: I just went to the counseling center at my university, and they said I may have bipolar II. Thank you everyone for sharing, it really helps me feel less alone in this. I hope you all get the help you need as well"
"Had anxiety about going to the post office to ship a package, forced myself to go and realized anxiety just makes everything sound worse than it really is and I’m proud of myself for going!","I know this sounds so like something so basic but lately my anxiety has been really bad preventing me from doing things 

I had to ship an item that someone bought off me online and I kept putting it off this week because I was too anxious to go to the post office and wasn’t sure what I would do once I got there.

My boyfriend told me that I should try to go because this was something I needed to do since I already got paid for the item. Sometimes all you need is some support from one person to tell you that you’ll be fine about a certain situation

Once I got back I felt so relieved, it was something so easy to do and I was just overthinking it and making myself more anxious but in reality there was nothing to be anxious about! 

I just personally felt proud of myself and wanted to write this in case anyone has been dealing with similar anxiety, we always tend to make out situations to be worse than they actually are, and you won’t know the outcome and that most of the time your anxiety is wrong unless you try!"
"REMINDER: Your aches and pains are normal, you are safe, you will be okay, you deserve to rest","I know quarantine gives us all plenty of time to think and hyperfocus on certain physical or emotional feelings. I am here to remind you that you WILL be okay. Don't give up. 

Your physical symptoms, although they feel very real, are normal and aren't going to hurt you. I PROMISE. I know they are so annoying, but the more you wish them away, the more persistent they become. 

You deserve to rest. I know everyone expects productivity from you right now, but it's okay to sleep longer than usual, play video games, or eat what you want. Do what you can, not what you think you should be doing. If everything feels like it's going to shit, take a few deep breaths, turn on some rain noises and take a nap.

Cut yourself some slack. You are going through a tough time. You are exhausted. You are tired of feeling like crap. It feels like it's never going to end. So give yourself a break. This shit is tough, but so are you. Don't beat yourself up.

Three months ago I was genuinely in the worst place in my life. Panic attacks sending me to the ER, dozens of doctors appointments, genuinely convinced I was on the brink of a heart attack. But here I am! Perfectly healthy, and so are you. I pinky promise everything is going to be okay."
"If you’re looking for a sign, this is it. Everything is going to be okay.","Just putting some positivity out there.

"Anxiety is like you’re Spider-Man and your spider-senses are always tingling, even when they shouldn’t be.","Sorry for this shower thought, but I thought it is actually a pretty good way of explaining anxiety."
"Most people are accepting of you having an anxiety disorder, but an unfortunate amount of people expect you to only have symptoms in private.","A stigma that I’ve noticed in the mental health community... so many people are happy to talk about it and embrace your differences, but oh no.. don’t have a panic attack in front of them, don’t seek re-assurance from today’s anxious thoughts and jitters. 

This is something that needs changing. It is more than ok for someone with diabetes to be comforted even when their their blood sugar gets too low and it affects their work. Even if the circumstances of the blip in their health was due to poor diet or a rough week (I had a co-worker that had this happen at work) but when I struggled with low mood I was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ 

This is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. 

Of course it’s not all bad, I’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. 

I felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare THEIR discomfort... like your doing it on purpose. "
"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!","I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

edit: thank you thank you thank you everyone for the kind words. it’s so awesome to be able to share this excitement with so many people! :) I will update once I hear back about the job."
"Does anyone else hate when they start talking about something they’re passionate about, but then start to feel like they’re being annoying and then stop talking about it?","To explain, 

I used to live in a decent sized city, and I found backroads in the country that takes me on a nice drive away from all of the light pollution and it’s nice to just be away from people and enjoy the country. Anytime I was feeling down or negative I would just hop in my car and go. The drive took about an hour and it was really peaceful, by the time I got home I was usually in a much better headspace. I just really loved that drive. 

When explaining the drive to a girl I was really into at the time, she was talking about how it’s impossible to remember that drive and every turn because there are many. I have driven on those roads enough to remember exactly when to take each turn, I proceeded to go over every turn. about halfway through is when i began to overthink everything. 

“does she actually give a shit about this?”

“you look stupid just stop”

the usual. 

I then stopped halfway through everything, gave like a half smile and said that I had forgot. 

This is just something that always goes through my head, there are probably better explanations on this but this is the first one that came to mind. Thanks for letting me vent guys."
Fuck anxiety,That is all 
A friendly reminder.,"You're not dying. Those aches and pains you're feeling? Normal. Those muscle spasms in your chest and all around your body? Normal. Feeling like your heart/chest is being squeezed? Also normal. Feeling like you can't breathe/aren't getting enough air/like something is stuck in your throat? Normal. Your heart is pounding and occasionally skipping? You guessed it, also normal. Those feelings of dread and like everything is gonna go wrong? Yep, normal and goes hand in hand with all these sensations when we're too aware of them. 100% of the sensations you're feeling and going through are normal in every day life, We're just unfortunately hyper aware of them. We feel a pain or uncomfortable sensation and our minds immediately go to the worst possible scenario, death, but that won't be the outcome. These things may be scary and uncomfortable, but they won't be the death of us. We've felt them numerous times before and haven't dropped dead then, we won't drop dead now. Stay strong everyone.

Does anyone else's stomach gets upset when anxious ?,My stomach always begins to ache when anxious . At times I have to excrete too . Sometimes it is painful .
Does anyone else get gastrointestinal issues when they are very anxious?,"I get gassy, crampy, and sometimes full on runs just from being anxious. My stomach will hurt and occasionally I'll get heartburn. Only when I'm highly anxious.

Edit - wow, this blew up. I had no idea this was such a common thing!"
UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work. Fml."
"Does anyone else get ""pee anxiety""? Like, when you know you won't be able to use a restroom for a few hours, you get really anxious about it and end up thinking about needing it the whole time?",Most of the time happens on longer trips or exams. It also usually ends in actually having to pee cause I couldn't get it out of my mind.
"does anyone else’s anxiety cause them to speak really fast and finish people’s sentences, leading to really weird conversations that don’t last long?","Personally, it’s like I can never just relax and let the conversation flow naturally. 

Sometimes I mumble my replies as well like I’m not confident enough to make my words audible, so that’s also pretty weird. It’s like I know I’m being weird but I physically cannot stop. "

I love you guys, okay?"
"For me, having anxiety (GAD) is like a game of Snakes & Ladders. One minute I’m feeling motivated, focused, and hopeful. The next, it’s as though the floor is collapsing below me.","My heart rate increases. I start to feel like people expect things from me that I can’t deliver (even though no one is expecting anything from me). I’ve had people in life remark “wow, you really have your shit together” but if only they knew that the outside doesn’t always match the inside. On paper it looks like I could be an overachiever but I am horribly debilitated by imposter syndrome and feeling like I always have something to prove. I’m 37F and have come to realize that I need to live in peace with my anxiety and stop trying to yield it to me all the time. It has its own plan and I need to roll with the punches. If I fight it for too long I exhaust myself and feel worse about myself. On my worst days I’ll have to take an Ativan to cope with the zero gravity rib cage crushing feeling - but if I’m lucky I hope to make friends with it so the floor doesn’t fall out from under me."
"After four years of suicidal ideation, depression, and the worst anxiety I’ve ever known, I graduated college today. Progress is possible, for anyone who needs to hear that right now.","College is undoubtedly the hardest thing I’ve done so far in my life, and there were a lot of times I imagined giving in before making it this far. I must admit it was very surreal being able to experience my ceremony after I was so convinced I wouldn’t make it so many times before. Shout out to all my fellow graduates, and to those still in university (or anywhere else in school/life) just know that if I can do it, anyone can. Progress is possible, just make sure you’re around to see it."
Does anyone else get EXTREMELY nauseous sometimes due to anxiety.,Sometimes I get so anxious in certain situations I literally could vomit. Sometimes I actually have and idk why this happens? In my brain I’m like “ok I’m good nothing bad is here” but my body just gets the WORST nausea I’ve ever experienced. Does this happen to anyone else? And how can I fix it?
My mother just told me that most people don’t over analyze and obsess over their mistakes made years ago? What is this witchcraft?,"So I showed her that meme of the girl lying in bed trying to sleep while her mind decides to suddenly replay her most embarrassing moments. And my mom said “does that actually happen to you?”

And I just... does it not happen to most people? You mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? What? How?? 

That sounds so emotionally healthy! Meanwhile multiple times a week I lie awake at night replaying the moments I most wish hadn’t happened.

Edit: Did not know this would resonate with people... also apparently this is a symptom of my OCD!"
Is anyone else’s life just surviving work each day so they can get home and collapse in bed and then repeat,Basically all mine is and has been for a long time. 
Anyone else completely avoid tasks because they don't think they'll be good enough at it?,"I have this a lot. I'll avoid cooking a new thing or doing a new task because I don't think I'll do a good enough job. I've noticed that a lot of my anxiety stems from a fear of disappointing other people, and I know that if I were to do a task for myself I could probably do it. But if the result affects others I completely tense up. It's like I suddenly forget to function at all if I'm given something I don't think I'll be good at. So I'll just avoid it entirely. Anyone else?"
I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given! It's great to feel not as alone in this discomfort, and I think I have some ideas and goals on how to improve my situation in this new year. Thank you all so much."

My best friend became a mass murderer. I’ve never been the same since that day.,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. "
Does anyone else hate when you have to do something the next day? Like you can’t be at peace until you get it over with?,"I get this everyday of my life. I can never live in the moment. I’ll be having fun for a second and then i’ll remind myself that i have to do something the next day and it makes me anxious, restless, annoyed and stressed the whole time. 

Do you guys experience this kind of anxiety? If so, how do you deal with it? 

How do you learn to live in the moment and not for the next day?"
Anyone else have constant anxiety rather than attacks?,"I hear a lot of people with anxiety talk about having anxiety attacks or panic attacks, but it’s never really been that way with me. I just seem to constantly be on edge with everything, even small stuff, and every once in a while I’ll have “waves” of increased anxiety for a few days. Does anyone else have mild or moderate stress at all times instead of actual anxiety attacks?"
"Does anybody else crave a day home alone, but your anxiety/depressions also gets worse home alone?","I’m sorry for that horribly constructed sentence. I’m a weird split between extroverted and introverted, but I LOVE having a day or two to myself to just do whatever I’d like in the comfort of my cozy home. However, my anxiety makes it SO hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing ‘relaxing’ things when I should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground. I end up crying, getting nothing done, and also not being able to relax, so then I’ve wasted a day and now I feel 100x worse about myself. 

Does this happen to anyone else? 

EDIT: Thank you all for your replies. It definitely makes me feel less alone in all this. You guys are the best. 💗"
Life Pro Tip: Do NOT constantly be watching the news on this stuff,"Keep informed on key updates and take the medical advice seriously (distancing, washing hands, etc). 

But trust me, do NOT be watching the news 24/7, googling it all the time and scrolling World News subreddit constantly for updates. **This will destroy your mental health.**

People who don't have anxiety are panicking, so what the hell do you think those with anxiety will behave like?

It's not worth it. I haven't watched the news in 2 days and I've now put several subreddits on block. Honestly my anxiety is WAY less! It really does make a difference."
"If you felt awkward today, I want to congratulate you...","For trying your best.

For making the phone call.

For answering the phone.

For not staying at home.

For putting in the effort.

For trying something new.

For reaching out.

For asking for what you want.

For taking a risk, any risk at all.

It may seem like a failure today, but these little experiences will pay dividends in your future. Don’t give up!"
"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?","This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups. And I always feel like people look down on me and think I'm weird, stupid, oblivious, overly sensitive, childish, or a whole slew of other negative traits."
"This time last year I couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.","I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask, and my PMs are always open to help anyone! "
does anyone else ever get into that mood where every sound is just too much and you want to cry,"It’s probably something like sensory overload.

but it’s just this strong agitation that overpowers everything else and you just want everyone to shut up. 

like the only thing that will fix it is sitting in a dark room in silence and crying.

I hope you guys can relate at least a little bit"
"Today, at 22 years old and after years of panic disorder and anxiety, I applied to college for the first time.",I dropped out of high school at 17 due to consistent and debilitating panic attacks and thought I would never be able to go back. After two years in an academic upgrading course I am finally able to apply to college with a 90% average. Feeling so fucking proud. Don’t give up. Ever.
YESTERDAY I HAD NO ATTACKS! LET'S GO BABY!,"First time in a while. Jesus, this feels fantastic."
"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?","Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.


EDIT:

Thank you all for your support, advice, and kind words. When I posted this I never imagined it would get this much attention. It’s so wonderfully comforting to know that I’m not the only one going through this."
Does anyone just randomly start thinking about bad shit that happened years ago?,I do it periodically 
"Everyone seems to be afraid that the coronavirus lockdown will never end, but I’m afraid of the fact that it will.","I don’t want to go back to my job. I don’t want to go back to school. I don’t want to watch the world pass me by again. It feels like lockdown has slowed the world down to my pace, things aren’t so fast and intense anymore, I feel like I have time to keep up with things and enjoy things. Is it having it’s downsides? Yeah, but I can’t say that the negatives are outweighing the positives. I go back to work next week and I’m dreading it so much. I’m so anxious around people and they can observe it, so naturally a lot of people are apprehensive about speaking to me, or that’s how it seems, and I find it so difficult to actually attempt to fit in. It feels like once the lockdown is over people will go back to their social lives and will be able to enjoy themselves, but I won’t, because I haven’t got a social life. All I’m going to get out of lockdown finishing is the gift of going back to my torturous work."
Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that’s my problem?"
This might be a silly thing for some people but I made a phone call!!!,I have extreme anxiety with the phone. I don't know but it stresses me out. I got a call from my doctor and let it go to voicemail as usual. But I said fuck it. Practiced what I was going to say a million times and called back. I was shaking the whole time but I did it and I'm really proud of myself. I'm slowly exposing myself to social things and this was the first step!
Posting to Reddit is scary,"I'm scared to post anything here. I can't count the number of times I've had an entire post/comment written out, and I delete it because I get scared. Getting downvoted is terrifying to me. If I have an opinion that might be umpopular, delete. It's not that I don't know how to express myself, I'm just scared to."
"For every upvote, I will read one AOL Instant Messenger chat log from my high school days.","I just found a folder of my old chat longs from age 12 to about 20. There's hundreds of files here.

I already think so much about the embarrassing shit I did back in my teenage years. Why not ruin any chance or repairing my social anxiety by reading every single one and committing them to long term memory? It'll be like suicide for my sanity 

I already found one chat where I told one of my online-only female friends that I loved her... I was 13."
"Does anyone else get this sense of ""dread"" everytime you're home because you gotta go back to work the next day?","I always get this dreaded feeling everytime i am home. At work i feel fine, no anxiety but everytime i come home i get anxiety about the next day.

Even if it's friday i start dreading monday. I don't even dislike my job that much but i think it may have to do with very bad job experiences with not so nice employers/colleagues.

Anyone else get this feeling? I am diagnosed with Unspecified phobic anxiety mild to moderate."
Do you randomly get an awkward thought and cringe physically?,"Hi I don’t know if I’m alone but  randomly while doing work i would get awkward thoughts or memory and I’ll cringe? 
like noticeably cringe to the degree that if I was reading something, I would read it louder. Or I would say random things out load because of all the awkward energy. 

Please tell me that I’m not alone

TLD;R I get physical reactions to thoughts

Edit: We got a nameee for ittt!!! It is called “cringe attacks” and you can find it on google! thanks u/Thy_Introvert

Edit 2: it’s most likely a form of intrusive thoughts. We all have stupid crazy thoughts, that’s ok and very normal. What may indicate a problem is when the existence of this thought begins to persist, bother you, affect your mood, your life or relationship with people. Having the though is no problem but your *reaction* to the though might indicate something bigger like OCD. Please stay safe and consult a professional if you think it indicates a deeper issue❤️"
Hey when was the last time you took a deep breath? Why don't you take one now?,In and out. You are alive after all :)
Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it’s mania because it’s so unusual.,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know I’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. "
Does anyone else think up scenarios of how things will play out and get extremely worked up and anxious about it?,Any help or advice would be great
Can someone wish me a happy birthday?,"I don't really have any friends in school or in general because I'm very anxious and socially awkward so therefore nobody wished me a happy birthday today, so I was wondering could anyone wish me a happy birthday here, it would be really appreciated!

Update: I went bowling and had a nice day in the end, everyone's kind words, support and advice really made it a lot brighter! Thanks to everyone!"
"Does hearing the sentence ""I have bad news"" make your anxiety shoot through the roof?","I *hate* when someone tells me that they have bad news. My stomach drops and all kinds of terrible scenarios run through my head. And 99% of the time the ""bad news"" ends up being something trivial like the grocery store is out of garlic powder. I wish people didn't use that phrase so lightly. "
Anyone else take their headphones off their heads every 5 seconds to make sure they're not loud and someone else is hearing them?,"And feel like the person next to you is annoyed by the loud music but choosing not to tell you to turn it down?

Edit: omg guys
I'm fairly new to reddit so this is exciting for me! I'm not actually diagnosed with anxiety, but I still feel anxious and think the thoughts most of you think. So thank you for so many upvotes! I did not expect this! 😁😁🤗🤗"
"It took me two trips to grocery stores and driving around for thirty minutes, but I finally got myself to go in and get food. I wish this wasn't something people would tell me to be proud of for trying and succeeding. This is my life",No hate to people that do feel pride in getting over this. I do feel like you should. I just wish I wasn't in this situation
I GOT ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE!!,"I got my first acceptance letter today!!! High school was a pretty shit experience for me. Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn’t even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn’t be more proud right now. I’m IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took time to share your experiences and congratulations. It means so much and it’s encouraging to no end. You all are such lovely people💙💙"
I have anxiety and I'm terrified of confrontation so I create arguments in my head where I can say what I really feel. Does anyone else relate to this or am I just weird?,"I'm scared of having a debate with any of my friends because I'm afraid that they'll use that as a reason to not bother with me anymore, like they've been looking for a valid reason to get away from me so they'll take any small argument as a reason to escape. Every time I get even into the smallest of debates, I'll *always* feel like the bad guy, even if I didn't cause it or even if I'm right. I hate making people upset so I'd rather admit I'm wrong (even if I'm not) or apologise just so it pacifies the other person. I always visualise fake or past arguments in my head where I say what I actually wanted to say and it makes me feel angry but it's also empowering because I'm saying what's on my mind without the consequences of saying it for real. Am I just spineless or is this something that others feel?"
Does anybody get anxiety because of too much empathy? I feel terrible for random people i see alone or for whatever random reason.,Edit: wow i really expected to be roasted for calling myself empathetic.

I hate my life right now as an American.,"There's no more structure.  There's no more rules.  There's chaos everywhere and there's no end in sight.

I'm terrified to go back to work because I know they won't protect me.  I've become pre-diabetic in quarantine because of a culmination of bad habits, and I have no money to see a doctor about it.  

&#x200B;

I honestly don't know how to proceed.  I'm frozen in fear of every option.  I barely eat.  I have no sleep schedule anymore.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I don't want to be here anymore."
Does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off,"I live around Koreans who think sighing is rude, and other people have mentioned that I sigh a lot especially when I am stressed, but it doesn't mean I am upset necessarily or displeased with the person I am with, I just do that to help myself think more clearly and get rid of the anxious feeling/dread in my chest and stomach. It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this. Not doing it is almost unbearable physiologically though - I feel like I have to do it to release the sensation in my chest and stomach. Am I the only one?"
Anyone else get random cringe flashbacks?,"I keep getting overwhelmed with thoughts of embarrassing things I did like 5 years ago. It comes with a wave of anxiety and the strong urge to crawl under a table or punch myself for doing something so stupid, and it's like I'm reliving all the cringe."
"After bombing at my working interview last week due to panic attacks, I got a second chance with an even better business in a similar role today. I decided to have fun with the interview and it was low-stress and anxiety. I GOT THE JOB.","I am seriously over the moon right now!  This is my DREAM JOB and I can't believe I scored it!  I followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to all interactions with this employer.  I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  My anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that I actually have a full time job, 2) that I'll be doing what I love, and 3) It's less than 15 minutes from my new home.

What will I be doing, you ask?  Working with DOGS!  I love, Love, LOVE dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  I'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (I love giving them baths!).

I feel the complete *opposite* of what I felt going into that second interview at last week.  In every way.  I'm confident, too...  That's rare for me.  Thanks, anxiety.  Seriously, though...  Thank YOU, r/anxiety!  I approached this opportunity today using the tips and advice you gave me...  And it worked beautifully!

I start tomorrow at 11 AM.  Wish me luck!!!  :D"
"I am incredibly lonely all the time, but I feel so relieved when I don’t have to be around ppl. Anybody else experience something similar?","Edit:I’m not sure if anyone will see this edit, but thank you all for commenting on this post. Reading all your comments has been comforting, but also heartbreaking knowing there are so many of us that struggle with something that seems so simple(being around other humans) I went to bed last night feeling very defeated as I gave into my anxiety yet again and bailed on a social event to stay home and be alone. However, I woke up this morning to see all these responses and they honestly made me emotional because now I see so many people struggling with this same thing! There is probably ppl even in my own apartment building that feel this way and I can’t reach them! I can’t find them because of my anxiety holding me back. This viscous cycle has to be broken.... We are weakest alone. We need each other. We can not accept isolation. "
Telling somebody with anxiety to stop worrying is like telling somebody with epilepsy to stop having a seizure.,Saw this quote today and it needs to be shared.

Does anyone else stay up all night because they're nervous about the next day?,I don't mean like not being able to fall asleep because you're nervous but just every night purposely staying up so that the morning will arrive slower. Idk how to explain it but I stay up till like 7am every night because I don't want the next day to be here yet. I also stay up because I feel like I have so much to do before going to sleep but then I end up procrastinating it and not doing it and staying up for no reason. idk maybe someone can relate?
"If you’re reading this, I hope you have an amazing day.","Struggling with the extreme highs and lows of anxiety and trying to push through by beginning my day with meditation and a positive note.

I just want to tell someone that I'm trying.,I may not succeed but I'm trying.
Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn’t make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone’s reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don’t let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don’t let your imagination get the best of you."
"Anxiety means constantly trying to figure out whether that feeling in your gut telling you to ""ABORT MISSION!"" is real and important and should be listened to, or whether it's irrational catastrophizing that should be confronted and ignored.","""Am I setting myself up for disaster? Or is my overthinking and constant questioning what's setting me up for disaster?"""
Finally passed my driver's test at 25!!!,"I was so nervous that my foot was shaking on the gas pedal. I almost chickened out and didn't even go today, but I'm glad I did! Just came here to say that I am proud of myself for finally doing it and to let you guys know that you can do it too!




Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!"
"Do y'all, especially those with GAD, get really really irritated some days when your anxiety is high? Like anything makes you feel like a ball of flames on the inside but on the outside everything thinks your being sweet as always?","Just curious

I adopted a kitten and ive been bawling because i love him so much. I'm a proud cat dad,"I cant tell if this is overdramatic or adorable, but I got this beautiful baby boy the other day, and hes just so sweet and wonderful. Lately at times I've felt a lack of empathy and alot of anxiety, but when I saw him I thought of how small he is and how I cant wait to be a dad. And I had a ton of anxiety regarding whether I set up his safe room well and if I would do something wrong and all that. All is going well so far, but just sitting here with him seeing how beautiful he is, and releazing how much I really do love him, I've just been crying my eyes out. Idk if this is weird or not. Regardless, I'm happy to welcome home my little Why Not. His names Olly💙"
I get anxious because I feel like no matter what I do I could be doing something better with my time so I end up doing nothing at all,"Literally, nothing. Reddit, ring a few friends, rarely go out and I'm unemployed. I'm 30 and I feel like a piece of garbage"
I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

Edit: Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it. I called some people and have a job interview this friday at a place I like

Edit 2: Wow this really blew up huh, again, thank you so much for your nice comments. I've read all of them and I am speechless. Also a big thanks to the person who gave this post platinum, I appreciate it very much. I don't really know what to say, this community is so kind. Thank you "
I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today. I have two assignments due later today and I feel confident that I'm gonna get them done and turned in today."
I got my driver’s license!!,"After a whole night of worrying myself, and crying I ACTUALLY PAST MY TEST!! I’m so happy :))).

Currently In a busy resturant eating by myself not giving a fuck,....small steps
When you’re so used to feeling anxious that being calm and relaxed feels like a high,"I’ve been feeling very calm and relaxed recently, and because I was so accustomed to confusion and worry, mainly due to not having a clue how to behave socially and being fearful of having a meltdown whenever I’m at work and people all talk at me at once, being in such a calm state felt like, to me, I was high. As in, stoned or dosed up on benzos. I should mention I didn’t actually take anything. Who else has noticed this? It made me realise how intrusive and disruptive anxiety actually is, and that despite letting it exist, it’s way too much of a plastic bag over my head to ignore, which is why I am going to make more of an effort to counter it instead of living with it. "

GOT THROUGH MY FIRST DAY OF WORK WITHOUT A PANIC ATTACK!,"Dont get me wrong i was anxious but i was able to get through it and had a good day at work

EDIT: my heart was racing almost all day while I was there because I'm not use to working. Ive been unemployed and unactive for almost a year so it made me anxious about my heart. But i didn't have any chest pains or anything so i guess it was all anxiety related

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT! YOU ARE AWESOME"
Does anyone else keep thinking about and over-analyzing humiliating events from 10+ years ago?,"I recently had a (sort of sudden) realization that everyone would make fun of me in High School, with me being the joke and the only one not knowing what was going on (even the teacher was in on it...). These moments were ongoing and humiliating - I would almost always play into the joke too. 

I never thought I was popular, but I never realized how big of a loser I was during those years. All of the people who pretended to be my friend were actually making fun of me. I graduated high school over 10 years ago and have become a self-supporting adult now, but still struggle with self esteem. Nonetheless, I'm not sure why this suddenly bothers me. Since HS, I had a pretty successful time in college and am doing well in my career, but still keep going back to these HS thoughts. Has anyone else had this happen, or have any advice?"

"Had anxiety for years and I finally plucked up enough courage to apply for a job and I got it, I am now building up money to move to London, fuck anxiety and depression will NOT take my life","Been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. There’s been many times I  contemplated suicide.

The other day I just thought fuck it I’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere I can feel more happy and fulfilled.

Still not out of the woods yet but I’m trying given the terrible circumstances.

Of course I am anxious and scared still of the uncertainty, I hear the horrible voice saying ‘everything will fail’ ‘nothing will work out for you’

London will be a fresh start for me, whilst I’m at it I might even change my name and identity lol"
Anxiety makes the smallest criticism feel like an absolute condemnation,"I already feel like a burden to everyone around me, so whenever someone criticizes me of a relatively small thing (justly) I spiral into this pit where I think that I'm making other people's lives worse by being a piece of shit. Drinking two cups of coffee in the morning probably didn't help either... 😅

Any tips on how to shake this feeling off?"

Does anyone else's stomach get messed up by anxiety?,"I've been crazy stressed this week and have been getting a lot of stomach aches. Then last night, these awful stomach cramps started and they still haven't gone away. At this point I'm honestly not sure if it's anxiety or if I'm constipated lol. Though I'm more inclined to say it's anxiety because the pain seems to vanish the moment I stop feeling anxious, and then comes back when I start thinking about it again. No fun :("
It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

"Is there anyone else here that makes themselves physically sick (such as vomiting, heartburn, etc) because of their anxiety?","Hi,

I’m new here and I guess I just hope I’m not the only one that deals with this. I’m diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Social Anxiety.  I’ve been making myself physically sick the past week over going to a bridal shower on the weekend. The reason I have the anxiety is just the fear of being judged by others or saying something stupid.  I’ve even been in group therapy (iOP) for weeks to try and find ways to lessen my anxiety, but I just feel  like I took a step back. Yesterday, I was so stressed out about this that I caused myself to vomit even; I’ve had a migraine, some random nausea, and heartburn the last week due to the stress and anxiety too. Is there anyone else who has this happen?"
"whoever you are, I love you.","the panic will subside, I promise you. take in deep breaths and remember that you are loved and appreciated. above all, you are strong, and a short-lived bout of anxiety won’t and can’t kill you, you beautiful, beautiful human being.
idk you but I’m here for you.
again, I love you. take care."
Ugh. Posting comments on reddit gives me anxiety 🤦🏻‍♀️,"I thought I was being helpful with a comment but just saw I got downvoted -10 and now I feel awful 😑

I was just elected to City Council tonight.,"Hey all. I’m 26 years old (F) and decided to run for City Council in the spring of this year. After making it through the primary, I worked on my campaigning all myself. Made my flyer, bought the list of registered voters from the city, bought all postage, folded them, and mailed them all out.

Tonight is a win for all of us. It’s proof that we can get over these mental barriers from anxiety  if we let ourselves. It’s a hard fight, but tonight more than one battle was won."
I introduced myself to my class today without my voice shaking. I call that a real victory. 😄,It’s the worst week ever at university. Syllabus week. The week where everyone has to introduce themselves. I had to do it twice and each time my voice didn’t shake when usually it does. This is such a big deal for me. Cause I’m always embarrassed by how my voice shakes at first when introducing myself to others or talking in front of a large group. 
To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day,"This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this. 

Edit: This post blew up more than I thought! I wish I could reply to all of you, but I'm super busy prepping for exams (that's right, today's not a self sabotage day like yesterday). I feel so happy that what I've said has helped people. S/o to the awesome community here, and to my fellow anxiety sufferers for being so welcoming and supportive to each other. Let's make today great!"
Does anyone else feel like they're constantly doing something wrong but nobody's telling them what it is?,"That's the best way I can put it. When people are nice to me I convince myself it's forced, someone has asked them to do it/they are obligated to do it, and that I'm constantly making mistakes but people aren't telling me to spare my feelings. 

It borders on paranoia and is very overwhelming, I just constantly fear having made some sort of mistake/making someone mad and that nobody is telling me about it. It's a daily occurrence for me to have this thought process.

Is that weird? Am I alone in this?"
"I hate when you drink caffeine to get energized, but instead just get a panic attack and consequently wiped out...","This happened to me today

Oh well"
Does anyone else get stomach pains and diarrhea with their anxiety?,"My anxiety is partly linked to my extreme emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and for those of you who don't know about it, it ruins every aspect of my life, to the point where if I get the slightest stomach pain or uncomfortable feeling ill panic, which results in me having stomach pains all the time, and sometimes, maybe once a month or so I'll come across feeling awful, with crippling stomach pains and end up on the toilet for half an hour with poop coming out like a faucet, does anyone else experience diarrhea along with their anxiety? It really sucks"
Does anyone else feel like their anxiety swallows up their whole personality?,"Sometimes I feel like I don't have a personality beyond the anxiety.
I've been anxious my whole life.
There are so many things that I can't do because of this fucking disorder.
It makes me feel so fucking hopeless."
I am too sensitive for this world,"Does anyone else just break down crying whenever they make the smallest mistake? I am so worried about never being good enough that anytime I do something wrong or can’t figure something out, the tears start coming. I feel like I have absolutely no control over my emotions and it’s humiliating me. I started crying in class, in front of my supervisor, and in public, all for reasons that seem so small in retrospect. But when I start crying I get so embarrassed that it makes me cry even more. My dad told me I need to grow a thicker skin and my supervisor told me my body language is always aloof and uncaring when I’m turning away to avoid making eye contact to try and stop the tears. I can’t seem to win. I can’t even check my email anymore because I’m so afraid to see someone saying I’ve done something wrong. I don’t feel as if I was made to fit into this world where I can’t even be told I’m not doing good enough without completely breaking down. What can I even do? I feel like I’ve lost all control of my life."
Does you anxiety ever make you feel like the people who love you the most actually think you're the worst person ever?,"All week I've been overthinking every interaction I have with the people I'm close to and overanalyzing any comments they might make.  I've totally convinced myself that my fiancé actually hates me and thinks I'm incompetent garbage and it feels bad, man."
I graduated college today,"I fucking did it. 5.5 years, 3 schools and 2 majors later I finally graduated with my bachelor’s degree and have a full time job lined up. My anxiety was so bad this last semester all I wanted to do was take a semester off and push everything back because I didn’t think I could get through it, but I did. And now I’m done. I’m just proud of myself and wanted to share. For anyone who thinks they can’t achieve their goals because of this debilitating illness, you can. Don’t let it stop you.

Currently at the movies alone for the first time in my life. I’m kind of freaking out with my hands shaking but I’m also a bit proud I’m doing it - going to the movies alone has been something I’d always wanted to do but been too anxious and self-conscious to do,"Okay so it’s in a city 2.5 hours away from where I live so it’s a bit of cheating, as what’s put me off doing it before is seeing someone I know lol, and I am doing it to distract myself from not eating today...but I’m still doing it! I’m still super self-conscious about it but I’m not bailing..yet anyway.

I’m pathetic I know lol, but there’s not many other places I can post about it, so here I am haha

anyone else find they need near constant background noise to help stop anxious/depressed inner thoughts?,"I realised I always have background noise, audiobooks, music, netflix, something on. I especially need this in times of quiet or before bed when my anxious and obsessive thoughts start to eat away at me. I can't seem to be alone with my inner thoughts, I'm not sure if it's healthy or not but the white noise seems to stem the flow and ease my mind"
Hey,"I just wanted to say happy new year to all the people in here who suffer from anxiety. I know it's such a hard thing to get over but we are the strong ones, anxiety can't take us away from our beautiful lives. Just keep fighting with it, we'll see better days in 2020. I love you all!"
"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too","I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Edit: thank you for all the kind comments, and for the gold ❤️"
"I’m finally leaving this sub, best of luck to all of you, wish I could hug every single one of you.","After years of battling anxiety and panic attacks, I am finally proud to say I live a life without excessive anxiety, panic and worry.

I’m so proud of myself. I just started college. I’m a week in. I haven’t had friends to talk to in person in years. I made 4 wonderful friends and they made me so happy last night.,"I didn’t wanna go to this school party/dance event last night.. I don’t know anyone here. Even in high school and my hometown I never had any friends to talk to in person. For years I was alone and only had a few online friends.. 

I’m so glad I decided to fight my social anxiety last night.. I went to the event. After an hour of walking around and standing in the back, I decided to walk over to this small circle that had formed. People were having fun and dancing around. And I ended up sticking around and then eventually one of them said something to me. We started talking and I met the whole group of them. 

Sorry for typing so much lol. I’m just so happy I finally have someone I can talk to in person. It’s amazing and I had a great night. I’m so so glad I decided to go to the event, despite being so anxious and not knowing a soul. This is a huge step for me and it feels amazing. 


**Update:** **She just asked if I wanted to come to her dorm to do homework, I agreed. But I’m instantly regretting this. What have I done.**

**Update 2:** **It was fun. She’s really nice and caring. Even got a hug. My first hug from anyone other than my parents or family in years. Thank you all so so much for your kind words. You’re all amazing!**

**Update 3:** **I’m beginning to worry I’m gonna make them hate me. I feel like I’m so annoying.. I’ve never really had friends in person, other than online friends, and Ive been texting them a lot. They’ve been busy so we can’t talk in person. Has this happened to anyone else? Your mind and anxiety keeps telling you they’re gonna leave and forget you so you have to talk to them a lot and very often so you know they don’t hate you and you can have a little relief? What do I do?.. 


**Update 4 (probably last update):** They we’re just busy. We hung out last night and watched a movie and had fun. Already have plans for Labor Day weekend. I still can’t believe this is happening. This is the best hint that’s happened to me in 3 years. Thank you all so so much for the kind words. You’re all amazing people. "
Anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so I’m going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety,"As the title says, I’ve got “a case of the spooks” where I feel woozy and dizzy and icky about just going to a car wash. As a kid I used to love going,  but now I find the chemically smell kind of difficult to manage. But the car is dirty and I want to do this. 

So now that anxiety has gotten involved, I want to be rude to it. So I’m gonna go get this car clean!

Edit: we got there and there was a line up of 5 cars ahead of us, so I had to double down on anticipatory anxiety too, but I WON. And the car is very pretty now!"
Remember to drink water. Remember to breathe. Remember to stay off social media.,"Sending all of you hugs and a reminder to take care of yourself and your loved ones. The little things can be the hardest in the face of all these big scary things. Take a deep breath in, and back out.  
  
You are going to get through this. 💙"
"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?","Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Does anyone's body feel ""shaken"" after high excitement/stress events where it takes a while to recover?"
Does anyone else dread a new day during the evening?,"As soon as the evening starts getting later, I dread going to bed sometimes because I don't want another day full of responsibilities that are making me anxious to start... I just want the evening of relaxing to be endless. Does anyone else get this??"
I got on stage in front of 600 people to deliver a speech for a public speaking competition... And I won!!!,"## Some Context
I was diagnosed with ADHD in March, that same day I decided to conquer my fear and spoke on stage for the first time in a public speaking competition against 9 other people. I ended up winning! 

A few nights ago, I competed in the Finals for title of *Inspirational Speaker of the Year* and many other amazing prizes... 

And I won!

"UPDATE TO: This past weekend, I overcame my anxiety and decided to shoot my shot: I asked out a guy I have a huge crush on and he said yes!! We're going out to get coffee soon 😊😊","Unfortunately, getting coffee isn't going to happen as he is currently talking to another girl and said she wouldn't be too happy with him getting coffee with another girl \*sigh\* **😒** **😒** 

I'm glad he told me even though I'm disappointed and I very much respect him, so hopefully we can be friends or something (because I really really like him and think he's super cool) so yeah... that's a thing... "
Are you ok? Leave your user name and I'll check in on you at least once this month and ask you how are you going.,"This is an idea I've been sitting on for about 3 months and now I'm willing to do it. 

I see posts about people having no friends and how making friends is hard all the time and I get it, I'm in that boat too. So I want to reach out to the people who would like a complete stranger to check up on them at a completely random time over the next 31 days.

If you leave your username I'll go through, when I'm bored, and send you a private message asking ""are you ok?""

You can reply with one word, yes or no, or you can spill your guts to me and I'll do my best to give you good advice or at the very least give you a ""Fuck that * insert person* for being such a * insert derogatory name.*""

Ok that is all :) 

Edit: Wow it went from 6 to 56 in an hour, I thought 30 would be a good number but this is also good. Thanks for all your kind words and to be honest I'm getting anxiety from just thinking about sending so many messages to random people but I promise I will get around to everyone by the end of the month. 

Edit 2: As suggested by a couple of people you can absolutely take note of a few users and send them a PM if you'd like. Me included. 

Edit 3: Oh crap, so long inbox, I barely got to know you. I'll just let this die down a bit before I start sending out more RU OK? PM's. But they will come, and when you least expect it, so don't wait on it. I'll be an RU OK? ninja. Striking when you least expect it. "
"If you see this, you better have a good fucking day!","And always remember, fuck anxiety, it’s all energy! Embrace it!


Edit: first silver ever!  Thanks kind stranger. 

I suffer from anxiety all the time. As I’ve gotten older I try to focus on the anxiety as energy moving throughout my body.  If I have anxiety and I feel it in my stomach, I zone in on how my stomach is feeling, pay attention to the anxiety moving throughout my body and it helps to relieve it eventually, don’t ignore it as it’s there for your attention, something about your mental thinking or the physical world is causing this energy to enter your body, find out what it is, pay attention, don’t ignore it."
Worth remembering if you're having a bad day.,"1. Your levels of norepinephrine, cortisol and adrenaline are off the charts. Your fear is a neurophysiological illusion, not a fair representation of the way things actually are.

2. Your anxiety is feeding on your fear. Why are you latching on to the thoughts you fear the most? What makes them feel more true than other, more neutral or pleasant thoughts? Contemplate for a couple of minutes.

3. Is your breathing shallow? Is your body feeling tense? Relax the body and take some deep breaths for a couple of minutes. Be mindful, and wait, with no fear. Remind yourself of the fact in point 1. Take note of the difference now.

4. Let out a deep bellylaugh at all this non-sense."
This is how you can stop cringing at that embarrassing thing you did 5 years ago!,"So a friend told me this and I think it's really helpful.

If you ever catch yourself rethinking something humiliating you did, stop and instead try to remember something embarrassing someone else did.
You probably can't and that's probably the case for everyone else and nobody remembers what you did."
Um hey,"Not sure this is important, but I went out eating alone for the first time! It went ok, I had trouble ordering, but other wise ok."
Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks. She accepted shows playing 24/7 but she didn't get it like y'all do :)"
"After months of unemployment due to anxiety and depression, I’ve now landed myself a job","I’ve had anxiety and depression for quite a while, years; it usually creeps up on me but then goes away, it depends on my mindset and lifestyle. Last year I lost my job (lost as in I had no choice but to leave due to my mental health) and went spiralling down, living off my savings which weren’t a lot at all.

Now, I can proudly say I turned up for an interview shaken and paranoid to be working there today and it feels great to be distracted. I can be on my own, I don’t have to talk to people all day and it’s laid back; perfect for myself.

I am extremely proud of myself, although I still have a lot of issues with my mental health I need to address, small steps like this really help everything else.

Thanks for reading :)

I just had a small conversation with two girls in my class AND I DIDNT OVERTHINK IT they were so nice and we laughed a little. And I even went to the board today to participate in my maths class and I volunteered for it!!! And I dont feel nervous I just feel excited and happy and accomplished yay.,It's so weird feeling this way because I was thinking of committing suicide two days ago
It's okay that that cringy moment happened to you in highschool,"It doesn't matter, we've all been there."
Hadn’t Left the house in four years update.,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best."
Does anyone go over all the stupid and awkward shit you’ve done in your head over and over again?,It’s one of those days I guess. I’m beating myself over stuff that happened years ago for some reason today.
I made a HUGE breakthrough today!,"I have a huge huge huge issue with doctors and being touched in general due to a sexual assault in the past, but I am really behind on my health and was overdue for a lot of things. I finally went to an ob/gyn for an annual checkup, and I was okay! I did it! I went through with the entire exam without a panic attack even though I was shaking and crying even thinking about scheduling an appointment. I'm so proud of myself and I hope I continue to fight through my anxiety and past traumas as effectively as I did today.

Edit: Thank you guys for all of your support. This sub is amazing and You all have helped me so much. I responded to quite a bit of comments in the beginning but it's takes me a while to respond and I'd spend too much time replying to things. If you want to talk you can message me. Thank you all so so so so much and I love you. love And thanks for the gold and silver!"
Honestly not wanting quarantine to be over,"I haven’t done anything social since covid started and I’m loving it. I hate parties, I hate social events so the fact that I like almost legally can’t go to any is great. Our state just okayed social gatherings of <10 people though so immediately my boyfriend’s friends decided to have a fire and invited us. 

I’m having an absolutely awful anxiety day - I’m guessing the fact that it’s tonight is primarily causing it, and I don’t want to go at all.

Is it normal to want to be by yourself this much? It’s been almost 3 months of quarantine and I’m still not socially rejuvenated."
Have you guys been crippled by your anxiety so much that you just don't do your assignments?,"Hi,

This is me. Worrying about my assignments just makes me stay still and not do anything.

Not doing anything leads to even more anxiety and more anxiety cripples me from doing anything. Its like a shitty negative feedback loop. 


As a result Im actually failing this unit lol. Every assignment has been handed late due to cripplying anxiety. 

I even got a fucking extension and I am way past THAT due date as well. 

God everything fucking sucks."
Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine. 

Does anyone else feel this way/get anxiety about this? If so...does it go on forever? Will there ever be a time that I feel fully, 100% relaxed and comfortable with how I’m surviving and doing things that make me happy?"
I'm defending my master's thesis before a jury in approximately 1 hour.,"Heart pounding. Shortness of breath. Dizziness.

"I bought myself tickets to a concert about two months ago just for myself. I forgot about it until this week, but I’ve been really excited about it! Every single day, I’ve been looking forward to it and not dreading it. I’m not even worried I’m going by myself.","Edit: Friends, I made it! I got dressed up, made it to the venue, and I’m here! "
"Today I realised that the only person who has ever got me, is me. I used to need reassurance from people around me that I am going to be okay, but the only person I ever needed to hear it from was myself.","When I’m anxious and slowly feel myself starting to spiral down into my anxious thoughts, I was always reaching out to other people, just needing to hear someone tell me I’m going to be okay. Now I have realised the only person I need to hear those words from are myself. I am slowly learning that a lot of the time it really is mind over matter; and oh boy, is my mind strong. I don’t need to depend on other people to reassure me I am okay. I can’t. I need to break the cycle. 
I feel I have come so far. I can sit there and tell myself I am going to be okay, and I can sort of believe it. It is so fucking hard to do, and it is so exhausting. I know each time I can do this I am making myself stronger. 

I don’t know why I am posting this. I guess I just had a sudden outburst of feeling somewhat empowered."
"Thank you to my car for giving me a place to scream, cry, and have panic attacks in peace.","Wouldn’t be here without you, thanks for being my safe space when I need to escape the world, even just for a quick drive around the neighbourhood."
Anyone else have to basically be dead to call off of work and not feel guilty?,"My stomach is an absolute mess, i can barely move without running to the toilet. But telling my boss I can't come in makes me crazy anxious, worrying they'll think I'm slacking or something. So then I put it off until I have to leave and just end up showing up and being miserable and unproductive all day. Anyone have issues calling off?"
so much of my childhood was undiagnosed anxiety,"my behaviors as a kid were so obviously undiagnosed anxiety and OCD. how did no one see or care. now, it’s on me to try to fix myself in a toxic environment with no access to help of any kind due to social distancing. poor child me had no idea what was happening or why she felt like that. poor thing. i feel so bad for her and her issues and why she didn’t realize they weren’t normal.


edit: i didn’t expect this many comments. thanks for sharing your stories and i’m sorry so many of us can relate :("
Does anyone else obsess over every little thing they say to people?,"Pretty much every social interaction I have with someone, no matter how small, I spend a ridiculous amount of time afterwards playing back what I said over and over again in my head. Even if what I said was totally normal, I still harp on it and pick it apart until I've convinced myself I've made a fool of myself."
Corona killed my anxiety,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.  

Appreciate that this is a hard time for most and dont deny what people are going through.  I got lucky because I have a very stable job and its just my husband and I at home."
"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.","I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good."
Anybody else enjoy the rain to calm them down?,"I’m sure a lot of you do, but I’m just having a shitty Monday and feeling extra depressed today for some reason. I saw it’s going to rain for the rest of the day once I get home from work, I got really excited and I can’t wait to sit at home to watch and listen to the rain to calm me down, it helps so much.

I hope you guys are having a great Monday."
Does anyone else still stress out and feel embarrassed over things that happened 10-20 years ago?,"I'm almost 30 years old and I still lay awake at night, feeling like a complete idiot of myself when I was 10-16 years old. Then I realize how stupid it is to even care, but it doesn't really help.

How do you get past this stuff?"
"I think the most disheartening thing about having anxiety is that it never goes away, you just learn how to cope better with it.",I cant see myself not having anxiety and really my heart just sinks. It’s just beyond cruel that this will be me for the rest of my life and the only thing that changes is how i manage it. There is no cure. I’m always going to be in my head one way or another. It’s exhausting.
Does anyone else bite their lips or inside of their mouth because of anxiety?,I’m always biting my lip especially at night when I’m trying to fall asleep sometimes causing it to bleed a little. Any tips on how to stop doing this? It causes red marks on my lip that I get insecure about but I just can’t stop. :/
Anyone get anxious and paranoid when they're feeling great? ie 'oh fuck when is this going to end and why',the universe is coming for me
Does anyone’s anxiety make them physically sick?,I feel sick to my stomach but nothing works to get rid of it. I also feel out of breath and shaky. I just want it to go away.
Anyone else not sold on partially re-opening states?,"It doesn’t seem like anything is actually getting better. 

More like people just feel tired of being locked in. 

Partially re-opening doesn’t mean people are automatically safe again. 

It’s not like the problem is going to disappear after Apr. 30."

social media is toxic as fuck,"I hate social media... It is a well known fact that it has a lot of negative effects on its users.   


This year, I have deleted all my social media accounts, and people closest to me treat me like a fucking mentally ill freak questioning why I am off social media like people you know I am depressed, and this shit doesn't fucking help!!! And like wtf do you really want me to take a video of my breakfast everyday like fuck off and let me live my life with or without you genuinely in it you noisy fucks.

get over yourself and leave me alone."
I skipped work today due to my anxiety and now I'm so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever done the same thing?,"My job makes me pretty depressed.

My boss has been away for over a month and I was basically left to my own devices, which was great. He returned today.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday. 

It's a vicious circle and I'm ashamed of myself for running away from my problems.

Anyone else ever done something similar?"

I slept with the lights off for the first time in 15+ years,"I’ve had crippling nighttime anxiety around someone hiding in my apartment and watching me.

For the past 2 years I’ve been in therapy and doing small exposures to disprove this belief that I have. 

Last night was the first time I could turn off all the lights in my bedroom and sleep in the dark. 

Seems small but I’m proud"
Does anyone get the feeling that you're supposed to be worrying about something but you just can't figure out what it is?,"Like, right now I feel like there's something I should be worrying about and it's killing me, it's driving me nuts, and it's keeping me on edge because I don't know what it is and I honestly just want to flip every table I see.

This happens like ALL THE TIME and sometimes I hope my brain is just normal.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies! It made me realize that I'm not alone and that there are other people who experience the same thing I'm experiencing right now and it made my day, thank you!

I hope you all have a good day!

(Hopefully me editing this post won't make offend anyone and I'm sorry if someone happens to get offended by it. I just wanted to express my gratitude)"
DAE get nervous to return to work or school after you've been away for a little while?,"For me, it doesn't seem to matter how comfortable I am somewhere (though it is worse at newer/less familiar places), but if I get sick or something and skip a few days of class or work, I get really anxious to go back. Particularly when I've been sick because I'm afraid I won't be totally better and I'll have to come home or it'll cause a lot of problems. Right now, I'm returning to work after leaving sick last week and I'm really anxious about it."
"Anyone else feel so self-aware of their anxiety, it almost feels like you’re faking it?","Even in the middle of a mild panic attack, I can feel myself freaking out — I know my breathing is shallow, my heart is beating really fast, and my thoughts are scrambled and erratic. But because I’m aware of all of this, it almost makes me feel bad, like I’m putting on some kind of performance, or am just reacting this way for attention (even when I’m by myself!)

Maybe it doesn’t make a lot of sense when I type it out, but does anyone else feel this way?"
Does anyone else here always feel like they’re in some sort of trouble or someone is upset with them?,"I think one of the worse symptoms of my anxiety is that I often feel in “trouble” or like someone is upset with me. 

Usually this will happen after working a shift or leaving classes for the day. 

I end up questioning the things I did or said during the day and if I did everything correctly. Often times these anxieties come up when trying to go to sleep. 

Does anyone else get this? How do you combat the feelings?"
"With anxiety, you know what they say: whatever doesn't kill you makes you 99.99% believe that it will kill you, leaving you to live everyday life legitimately fearing that you will soon die.","Haha I want off this ride, please."
Fuck anxiety,Fuck anxiety
Anxiety is just your brain coming up with fake news,"Today i learned my anxiety attacks are just like everyone else's , it's really comforting especially when the symptoms makes you feel like you're having a stroke but the neurologist was like :
 ""don't worry you're fine""
I didnt believe him at first but now I do !"
I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

&nbsp;


**Edit** : Thank you so much to everyone for taking the time to write a beautiful comment! I am really blessed and I'll never forget that! I hope  my story encourages you to reach out to people. You're not alone. Again, thank you so much :)"
anyone gets stomach upset when anxious ?,"I always get a very bad stomachache (diarrhea, constant farting and all kinds of smelly stuff) especially when i get anxious - and it’s always my left side of my stomach. Ugh..it’s truly awful..anyone had the same experience or is currently going through it?

*updated post*
Hello again everyone - thank you so much for sharing your experience! definitely did not expect to receive a lot of comments. My only big difference with you is that I’ve never been nauseous but just pumping out a lot of gases haha. Anyway, thanks again for your comments. I’m glad I am not alone in this:)"
I got my drivers license.. at 29,"I finally did it.. It took me until early this year to start working on my license (first aid, theory, driving hours)  
My 1st attempt I ended up having my exam hour on the one day when it was raining so hard I could barely see out of the car (I'd never driven in rain before)... I completely panicked and froze and, of course, didn't pass

  
I had my 2nd attempt yesterday, and even though I was shaking/sweating and (as the instructor later pointed out) made a couple of mistakes - I passed  
About 11 years late compared to everyone else my age, but I finally have my license"
The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety,"Not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff I keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow! This post really blew up from when I posted it during an anxiety attack. I'm glad that so many people find it useful and hope you guys gain as much mileage from this list as I have. :D"
Do you ever stay up late even when you’re exhausted to avoid facing the next day? Venting,"It’s been a stressful week. 
I just found out I owe more than I thought to the IRS which means I can’t afford to leave my toxic living situation, I can’t afford to see my sick father for the holidays because my new job won’t allow me to have vacation time as a seasonal employee. I have 3 different major assignments coming up that are nowhere near finished. Sometimes I wish I could hit the pause button on life to catch my breath and sort my thoughts. Staying up late is as close as it gets. The rest of the world is asleep and I can think in peace. As soon as I go to sleep, I’ll wake up and it will be time to move through the motions again and scramble to pull myself together. Yes, this is a rant but the question is not rhetorical. Feel free to respond if you relate. This is my first post here (hi)

Edit: I didn’t expect this much support! Thank you! Update: I got one of my assignments done and finished the paperwork for my new job today and I’m feeling good about it! I’ve been brainstorming ways to make my current living situation more bearable, and am aiming to visit my dad over spring break in March. I’m doing my best to stay positive and not dwell on too many negative “what ifs” in regards to his condition. Just trying to focus on one or 2 things at a time to avoid getting overwhelmed or spiraling out. I really do appreciate all of your kind words!"
We don't deserve this.,"None of us do, what we deal with daily is a living hell, and we just don't deserve it at all. It's hard living like this, unbearably hard but let's not forget that we're so strong and resilient for fighting it daily. Some people might wave us off and disregard how we feel with comments like ""just relax, it's not even that bad, you're just overreacting."" but that's bullshit. I know how it is, we all do, and I want you all to know I'm proud of you, you woke up today and you faced anxiety head on, you did a thing, be it small or big you tackled today's tasks and you didn't crumble under anxiety. You're improving, you're doing better bit by bit, and I know how hard that is. So if no one else will tell you, I will, I'm proud of you and you're doing damn good. It might take a long time but I know each and every one of us can overcome this, it might take longer for some of us, but we'll do it. So just keep tackling it day by day, we're stronger than this, we never asked for this, we never once did anything to deserve this, but I know we'll beat it. Stay strong, I love all of you."
"Do you ever have a week or two without symptoms and then start to think maybe you're finally getting better, but then you're hit with a day which is worse than you'd remembered?","Literally haven't had a problem with ibs symptoms for way over a week now, I finally thought maybe my body is healing and getting back to normal, and then I get hit with the worst stomach cramps on and off all day, my stomach is just in pieces at the moment and it's getting me so down. It's like doing hurdles. Every time I jump one successfully, I end up tripping over the next 7."
Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything. There's always been a whole host of things that made me anxious to the point where I'd avoid doing so much, even if I wanted to do whatever I was avoiding. I didn't even realise that it was a problem until I got into my teens and realised how much my anxiety stopped me from enjoying my life. 

From what I've read it seems like most people didn't always experience anxiety (correct me if I'm wrong), but as far back as I can remember I've always been that way. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has always experienced some form of anxiety since they were very young as well.

Edit: Reading through all the replies, it seems that it's a lot more common than I was expecting. Main reason I was curious was because went to see someone about my anxiety problems, he seemed confused when I told him that I'd always remembered being anxious and it wasn't something that started happening when I was older."
I love you,I hope you have a relaxing night <3
i went to a bookstore and got a coffee by myself today!,"i have severe anxiety and it is really difficult for me to do things by myself; i like to have someone with me as it helps me feel less pressured. however, i decided to go to barnes and noble (bookstore) alone today, and they have a cafe in there. the first time i ended up leaving the bookstore without getting a coffee because i was too nervous, but i ended up going back twenty minutes later and got one!! it was so easy, and the barista was very friendly which helped so much. i’m so proud of myself, and i’m so happy. i started to feel a little overwhelmed and almost left again but i did it!! i hope you all are able to silence your anxiety like i did today, and if not, there’s always tomorrow 💛"
"My son isn't even two yet, but sat beside me through an anxiety attack.","So I was having an anxiety attack  in my kitchen. My son was watching TV in the next room and I could hear him. So I sat on the floor and started with the breathing. A few minutes later, he comes into the kitchen cocks his head to the side. He comes over kisses me on the forehead. Then he sits besides me on the floor with a toy and smiles at me then plays with his toy until I calm down. 

Must have done something right with this kid."
Does anyone here also suffer from rejection sensitivity?,"If someone looks at me disapprovingly or even talks to me in an unusual tone, I tend to attribute that to them not liking me, and my body goes into fight or flight mode. I'm essentially convinced that everyone hates me and a lot of that is rooted in social anxiety and feelings of incompetency. I've never tried to make friends because I feel that they will not like me. I can't hang out in social groups because I feel that I act awkward, and I'm afraid that if I act awkward that I will be socially rejected. This really affects my life and my relationships with people-- I basically always feel incompetent. I interpret other's behavior through a very biased lens that harms me. My self esteem largely relies on how others feel about me (or rather how I think others feel about me). 

I don't know what to do anymore. This is a big struggle for me. I've attended therapy before, and it's obvious to me that much of this stems from unresolved childhood issues, but idk. I'm just wondering if there's anyone who feels like this because this makes me feel kinda ashamed and dumb."
"I don't give a shit about ""leaving my comfort zone"", I just want to feel comfortable right now","I've never in my life *not* felt anxious, so why the hell should I force myself to keep ""facing my fears"" if it does nothing to help me? Fuck it, I just want to feel okay right now. I don't want to expand my horizons or whatever, I just want to stick to things that make me feel okay-anxiety wise, and if that means staying at home most of the time, then it's fine. I don't give a fuck.


EDIT: I was going to delete this in the morning, but it really blew up, so I'm leaving it, lol. 


For what it's worth, I know this isn't exactly the healthiest mindset, but I'm so goddamn tired of expanding so much energy on *trying* with nothing to show for it."
I WENT TO A CONCERT BY MYSELF!!,No panic attack!! Yay!!
Does anybody get upset if they are going to be late?,"Even if it is a few minutes late... you get really upset. And if you're going to be very late to the event/meeting, you try to find an excuse to not show up at all.

I remember there was a day where I was late to everything. I remember feeling incredibly exhausted and frustrated with myself at the end of the day even if it was out of my control.

For me, being on time means that I am sticking to my routine and that things are going as planned. When I am late, I feel like a mess.

What can you do to make being late ok? I know it's not a big deal to those around me if I am a few mins late, but I feel horrible about myself. "
Does anyone else get anxiety around people there own age but are fine with older people?,"At work im pretty confident and anxiety free but when I'm walking through town my anxiety is high.

Has anyone found a solution as to what causes this?"
UPDATE: OH MY GOD YOU GUYS I GOT MY FIRST JOB!!,"I was already proud enough of [getting through just the interview ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/bkn5eo/update_im_at_my_job_interview/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

but oh my god, I didn’t think I’d actually get the job!! I know I’m super late to this getting-your-first-job thing but hey, better late than never, right!? 

I’m just going to be bagging groceries but I’ll be making $3 an hour more than I ever thought I’d make and oh my god.. I HAVE A JOB HOLY SHIT 

I have a week to mentally prepare myself for training. Everyone so far has been so extremely kind, so I feel a lot better about the whole thing though I’m still shaking with nerves right now. The manager is extremely kind, the woman I just talked to on the phone was amazing, I met some of the people I’ll be working with and they were all so very nice. 

Is it stupid I actually want to cry??? I’m so happy??"
"When I'm anxious, I procrastinate. After I procrastinate, I ruminate. Since I'm ruminating, I'm anxious to even get anything done, that I should have long started, thinking, ""What's the point of doing it now, remember the first time you tried and failed by procrastinating ...""","And I wonder why I am losing control over my life.

update: A silver and these comments down below - whoa! I was sleeping on this post, much like how that initial novelty wears off from anything on Reddit. But I did sign-up for gym in the meanwhile, after 8 odd years of reluctance. As u/Basith_Shinrah pointed out in a comment down below,“*You put it in words. I feel that's the first step in overcoming it*”."
Call me crazy but I'm loving the lockdown and curfew thingy.,"It's really crazy but I'm lovin' it. I'm particularly not anxious about corona since my city barely had one case and barely 10 or lower cases in my state. It's all been taken care of, so. But still, with lockdown and curfew as precaution, I kinda like it. I went up to the roof of my apartment and noticed how quiet the world seems to me. It was kind of comforting. I felt at peace. There were no noise from construction beside me and the one in front of me. There were no noises from vehicles or people. The only sound were of my footsteps and the birds. Sigh, all the anxiety I had at home, vanished in mere second."
"Here's to all of us at work who have snapped at colleagues, cried quietly at desks (or bathroom), had panic attacks and ruminated about it for hours on end!","We are doing the best we can. It's not easy, struggling and working at the same time. We are not failures. Don't give up!"
Posting literally ANYTHING is so fucking stressful,"I've had an account for 3+ yrs and have barely any karma bc I'm too anxious to post on any subreddit or even comment most of the time :(

edit: Omg I don't know why someone gave me gold for this dumb post but thank you so much for my first gold!!!"
"""A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears""",After reading this quote many times it made me rethink my anxiety and take a new perspective. Hopefully the insight will inspire you as well.
"Hey you. Yes, you.","You’re going to be okay. Take a deep breath. Everything is going to be alright! 
"
Was suicidal with anxiety eight years ago...getting married on Saturday.,"Eight years ago today I had had enough and sat on the sea wall at midnight about to throw myself in. Single, victim of DV, no full time job. I had terrible flashbacks, panic attacks, couldn't sleep. Now I'm still anxious but medication has helped enormously. I have a permanent full time job I love, a partner I love and I got to see my boys become fine young men. See your doctor. You can get through this x"
Tonight I finally asked the guy in the next apartment over to stop yelling to people over the computer to all hours of the night after about 3 months of trouble sleeping because of the noise.,"I was shaking the whole time but I said what I meant to and this is a major win for me. Of course I’m going to ruminate on the situation now and have trouble sleeping for that reason tonight but hopefully tomorrow night will be better. And yeah, the yelling was really that bad."
"Looking back on highly anxious times is so embarrassing, the cringe makes me even more anxious","You know, those times you constantly needed reassurance and you knew people were getting tired of you for it. Yeah, those times. 

When I think of those times I just want to isolate myself and never talk to anyone ever again."
"Was finally getting my life together, then this whole Coronavirus situation happened.","I've made a lot of progress over the last couple months, in terms of both managing my anxiety and improving my overall life. I've been going out much more often and been stepping out of my comfort zone, but I feel like all my progress is slowly being reverted. My anxiety is starting to get worse daily along with my overall habits. I don't know if i am the only one in this situation but it just fucking sucks."
Getting out of bed is really hard for me. Is anyone else's anxiety worst in the morning?,"My anxiety hits me the second I wake up. I feel awful and I have zero energy. I literally just want to lie in bed for the rest of the day. Waking up is hard for me in general. I have low blood pressure and I feel really groggy and dizzy when I wake up, so that makes getting out of bed even harder.

Once I do get up, eat,  have some water etc, I usually do feel better. But the problem is, mornings are hell for me, and some mornings my anxiety wins and I stay in bed till well past noon. 

Anyone have similar experiences, any tips? "
"DAE feel like their anxiety was taught/acquired through traumatic experiences and the ""real you"" is completely opposite from the person your anxiety makes you?","For example, I can be really really anxious and unsure in social situations, but sometimes when I can overcome it, I find myself very easily and very confidently talking to people. It feels like that person is the ""real me"" who just gets smothered by uncertainty and anxiety.

As in, I don't think my personality is anxious or shy or unsure, but I so rarely get to see that part of myself because I'm constantly bogged down with anxieties."
If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I’ve struggled for years and... I’m still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

EDIT #1: added one more step thanks to u/SaltedBiscuitTV
EDIT #2: thanks to u/veraamber for the reminder on ""imagining you're elsewhere"" might be harmful to some people
EDIT #3: as I am still in a very agitated mood and my legs are sore from all the stress I just realized... first silver thingy on here x2! It feels amazing that venting while I was having a hard time helped someone out - Thank you! :') 
EDIT #4: Close your eyes after you read all of it ;)"
"You can do WAY more than you think, don't let your insecurities define you. Listen to the wisdom inside you and cherish it. You have something good to bring into this world, let it be heard. Have a nice day ;)","Edit: thank you for all the positive feedback, it puts a smile on my face to know that you can believe in this post and that you're all filled with hope ;)

It's ofcourse often not easy to believe in yourself, a ""quick fix"" doesn't exist and maybe this post is very vague for you. I elaborated on this topic in the comments. Hope it can help you!"
Does everyone else's anxiety feel more intense at night?,"I swear that from the moment I wake up until dusk I feel good (to the point I don't feel anxious anymore) but when it's dark outside, even when I'm home with my family, my anxiety becomes more intense."
Today I joked at the office,And everyone laughed so hard. It felt so overwhelming that I had to go outside for air or else they could've seen me cry.
"Have you ever felt anxious because everything in your life is going on perfectly, but you are worried about something wrong that might be happening without you realize it?","It's a period in my life when everything is fine. I didn't quarrel with my boyfriend in years, I am passing all my exams, my parents are strangely nice and comprehensive with me, I didn't even catch a cold and I am surrounded by lovely people... I am used to living an unpleasant life, bearing problems all the day and feeling nervous at night and deeply unhappy. However, now I COULD live the perfect life, but I keep asking myself why is everything fine, what's going to happen, if I have any disease, what terrifying destiny is going to punch me in the face. Because of this, my hypochondria is getting worse, I sometimes am convinced that it's not possible for me not to have problems in life, so I must have some deadly disease and every signal my body give to me makes me want to run to the doctor... Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I fear that my house will burn while I sleep, or that some thief will break into my home to steal something (even though we don't own anything valuable!) and doing bad to my family... Have you ever felt that way or am I just an idiot to feel even more anxious because I literally have NOTHING to worry about?"
I ordered two Subway sandwiches successfully!,"I know it’s not that big of a deal for others, but I was able to order two Subway sandwiches without getting anxious and speaking quietly or stuttering. I’m actually really proud of myself.

edit: I usually don’t edit posts but all the support in the replies is really uplifting. Thank you all for that :)"
"Do you ever say, ""Okay, Let's start doing ____"" and then just, literally wait for yourself to move?","It's just.. I dont know. I was so prepared to do something, and when I wanted to start, I literally just waited. Soon, I ended up getting anxious, lol. Like, I can't make an action for myself.

Edit: I'm so freakin glad to be able to relate to yall! I really thought it was only me."
Having anxiety is exhausting.,"So much time and mental energy goes into worrying over every little thing.

What’s it like to be someone who can just have an interaction and walk away clean? What’s it like to be someone who doesn’t lie awake at night terrified?

I’d like to find out."
Fuck Anxiety. I Am Legend.,"I had an explosive panic attack yesterday that shot up my heart rate and blood pressure. I almost passed out. But guess what. I slept for 12 hours, and got right back into the thick of life! I refuse to crumble every time anxiety gets to me. I am a functional anxious motherfucker. But I'm also a warrior and will not back down! Stay hard!"
Anyone else get anxiety about having anxiety,"And because of your anxiety, caused by having anxiety, you get more anxiety."
The thing about an anxiety disorder is that,"You know it's stupid. 

You know with all your heart that it wasn't a big deal and that it should roll off of you.

&#x200B;

But that is where the disorder kicks in. 

Suddenly the small things is very big and it keeps growing in your head, and trying to escape from under skin.

You know with all of your heart that you're being ridiculous and You hate every minute of it."
"Who else is in their mid-late 20's and has hardly experienced life and never ""go out""?","It's really bothering me that I let my mental health own me so much. I am 26 and don't do anything fun. It's no wonder I am depressed. I never go to bars or clubs or have a group of friends to hangout with. I don't have any hobbies that'd help me meet people. I am doing nothing right towards socializing. I work and hang at home with my family. That's all i do. 

Who else is missing out on life and meeting people?"
"Anyone else lost the energy to deal with people, like ANY people, even friends?","My anxiety takes so much energy from me, I avoid people as much as I can, even my friends, even family. The moment they start talking it feels like sensory overload immediatly. I have to force myself out of the house so much. I am working from home, which makes it even worse. I DO feel lonely sometimes but then imaging someone being around is such an unbearable thought. 
It is NOT social anxiety, I am not scared of people or what they think of me, I just think they're unbearable and I lack the energy to deal with their bullshit. I used to be super extrovert some years ago, it all changed when I developed anxiety. 
I'm in therapy already, but it doesn't help, like at all. I don't wanna live and die like a hermit, but I don't know how to help it."
"I was having a particularly rough morning dealing with my anxiety yesterday morning. I decided to call in sick, but the idea of having to call in sick made me anxious and as a result, ended up going to work...","was a rough day at work with only a couple of hours sleep

how good is anxiety"
I wonder what non-anxious people think about all day.,"My mind never stops. It's not always negativity and worrying (it often is), but I'm always thinking about something. Not just casually thinking, but wondering, weighing, analysing.... I try to turn it off but it feels impossible. 

What do ""normal"" people think about all day, especially when idle."
"Guys, is anyone here having stomach problems because of anxiety ?","I mean despite diarrhea, are you having gases and just a nervous stomach ?"
Who else gets stomach issues and thinks it's related to being anxious often?,"Name the symptoms. I currently feel unwell after being woken up from anxiety then I had a BM
Im sipping ginger tea and took pepto and I got a heating pad.
I have a huge fear of vomiting btw so I'm worried it'll get worse. "
I booked my first therapy appointment!,"After about 10years of thinking about it. I finally swallowed my pride, was honest with myself and booked my first appointment. I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone I know, but it was a great relief and it feels great. Just needed to tell someone."
Anyone else get paranoid that everyone hates them?,"I have social anxiety and sometimes I get an overwhelming feeling that everyone around me hates me. I walk through work and I feel like everyone is staring and I did something wrong but I don't know what. I start to panic and I just want to quit and go hide. Anybody else ever feel this way?

Edit: thank you to everyone who commented. It’s nice to feel like you’re not alone in this world. I’ve often heard a dismissive “that’s irrational. Stop it”  when discussing this feeling and it’s so refreshing to see others relating and giving great advice. Thanks again everyone :) have a great day!"
I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I will never stop feeling guilty, I am really sorry. There is nothing I can do to feel better."
Does anyone else find it a little surreal that people just go about their lives?,"I don't know if I'm alone with this thought, but the idea that my friends can just go out is mad. Like people just get up and do. Daily stuff like catching a bus, going to the supermarket, going to lessons, all things I'd have to do with at least some level of panic involved. And people just get on with it.

Back when I was still able to go out, there were hours before hand of making sure I've eaten properly, washed thuroughly, at least 30 minute lie-down to calm. And then there's my housemate who just hops out at a moments notice.

It just seems... strange  


P.S. I was not expecting this many people to see this, I can't really imagine 900 indeviduals. There was 600 at my secondary school, that's mad. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and perspectives. It's been a really plesant to read them all <3"
Calmed myself down from a severe panic attack. I'm proud of myself.,"I was able to use self talk to help me calm down. I was vomitting, dry heaving, and shaking. It lasted a good couple of hours but I finally got to breathe. Apps like Calm and Forest help!

Edit: Big thanks to everyone!"
Does anyone else get nauseous when they get anxious but become scared of throwing up so it gets stuck on a loop?,"My anxiety is most commonly tied to my stomach. When I become really anxious (for no reason just because), I'll become nauseous (along with other symptoms). Except, while most people are scared of vomiting, I'm petrified. I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop. It's sort of paralyzing, especially since I have GAD and GERD, so I am constantly in fear of throwing up. 

Anyone else?"
Does anyone else cry when someone is unhappy with you or after being scolded?,"I just got a stern talking to from my boss about a mistake I made and I managed to keep it together while talking with him but as soon as I got off of the phone I started crying and wanted to hurt myself. Ive been crying off and on for the last 40 minutes and I need to get over it and move on. I wish I was more resilient. People make mistakes and not everyone is going to be happy with you all of the time, I need to learn how to bounce back and go back to getting work done not sit here and cry uncontrollably for almost an hour. 

Does anyone else struggle with this sort of thing? How do you deal with it? "
Anyone else really enjoy eating lunch alone?,"I'm pretty introverted and have a low tolerance for social situations (I get mental exhausted/bored quickly).

Lunch is my time to recover."
Today I won.,"Today I got up, showered and actually washed /brushed my hair. I noticed that it was a beautiful day after literal WEEKS of rain so I took a bunch of blankets and pillows out on the deck with books and snacks .. I ate real food for the first time in 10 days (penne Bolognese ).. 

Last night I finally slept after days of being awake even if it was only for a few hours then again today I had a small nap. 

I ran my life today and it felt great. I hope this feeling stays... although I could use some more sleep which I hope comes easily tonight."
Have you ever postponed crying and then couldn't cry later?,"So I had a crappy day, was condemned in public and I controlled myself from crying. It was a success! But I still felt like crying and the feeling of sadness/anger/misunderstood was(and still) stuck inside me. I waited until I could get back home to cry. However, when I get back I'm too tired to cry? Does that make sense 😂"
Anyone else get irrationally anxious to the point where they just clear notifications instead of reading them?,"Lately I've noticed I've been putting more off than usual, including even looking at my phone. I can't explain it. I know for a fact that when I open noticifications I receive, I'm the only one I can tell that they were seen. That still doesn't stop the feeling I get when I think about looking them. Panic, i feel like I'm gonna disappoint whoever the sender is with whatever I come up with as a response. It's ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. Anyone have any solutions to anything like this? Not currently on medication, working on getting on it (I'm canadian and need to apply for a physician because my childhood one is no longer my family's provider), I'm 23 year old male if that matters."
today i broke out of my anxiety and went to the cinema alone,I saw Glass and it was amazing
Does anyone else get anxiety from being seen by someone they know?,"If I’m at work, or at a store, or just driving my anxiety runs wild if I see someone I know. I’m not sure why I am so scared of being seen by people I know but I literally cannot just drive around with my windows down or anything like that. It’s giving me anxiety just thinking about it. I work a nice job and drive a nice car so I’m not embarrassed about it. Anyone else have this problem?"
After not leaving the house in 4 years..,"I can’t stop smiling right now! In June it will be 4 years since I left my house and today I went to the Home Depot and made a purchase!!!! Walking to the car to leave felt like I was walking into a war zone! It’s not far from my house but there is a couple traffic lights that scare the shit out of me, not to mention it’s the freakin Home Depot on a Saturday morning😬😬😬😬.  It was not easy and I thought I was gonna loose it a few times (and almost did) but I somehow kept it together. I am just so proud of myself right now and needed somewhere to say it!  There is hope out there🙏🏻.

Edit:  WOW, silver and gold!, thank you all so much, I can’t tell you how happy I am from all the support. I am literally having the best day!!!!! 

 Brief history of how I got to this state in comments..."
Today I ate in a restaurant by myself,"I’ve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I’ve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I’m in company I’m comfortable with, I’ll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I’m going to choke on every mouthful. I’ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought “fuck it” I’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate. It was overwhelmingly liberating, I could have cried. It wasn’t easy to eat but I finished my plate and I’ve never been more proud of myself."
Guys I made it to the gym today!!,"After having signed up (online) in October!

Edit to add: I've now gone THREE days in a row! I even used TWO machines!!!!"
I GOT A JOB!,"The past 6 months my agoraphobia had gotten so bad that I avoided leaving my house completely. A few days ago I decided to start applying for jobs. I had an interview today and after having 2 panic attacks about it and fighting my fears for hours, I went. 

The interview went so well that they wanted me to fill a different position that would be way more interesting, pay more, and I’d have my own office. I was hired on the spot. 

Needed to share this with somewhere. Don’t have a lot of friends lol:)

Update: 
Thank you for the silver❤️ I had my first day today and it was awesome. My manager is great."
Self-checkout line is the best thing to have happened to humanity,"Your girl just wants to go to the grocery store at 11 PM without having to interact with anyone and it could be a reality thanks to this magical invention. Yay.

Just the thought of it is relieving honestly."
I went to the bakery alone!!!,"I'm 17 and basically can't do anything by myself. If there's no one with me when I go outside, I completely freeze up. But this morning my mom was sick so she slept a little longer. I went to the bakery all by myself and even managed to order a coffee to go :)

This is such a silly thing to be proud of, I know. But it's a big step for me. Anxiety has ruined so much, but things like this make me realize that I've improved - no matter how little.

Edit: thank you so much for all the nice comments! And I thought my day couldn't get any better :D I hope that every single one of you keeps celebrating your small but important victories!"
Anyone else feel like conversation is just a set of rules and ur always carefully following them and ur constantly trying to not be awkward or weird or talk too much about yourself?,"I dont know if its normal to be like this, sometimes I feel like maybe I have undiagnosed ADHD, but other times I think its just all the anxiety and depression from being a college drop out and being gay and trans. Like am I really this stupid and spacey or did I make myself stupider as a defense mechanism since I didn't have a reason to suddenly be so shit at school?"
anyone constantly running conversations with other people through their heads?,"so I feel as if i’m an awkward person. I’m not the best at carrying conversation. bad at bringing up topics to talk about. so most of the time i just ramble nonsense during conversations. and i feel as if i sound ridiculous. 


then i sit there. hours later running the conversation through my head. why’d i say this? or why’d i say that? these people must think i’m a weirdo. i could have done this or that differently and maybe they’d think i was normal. 

my mind never stops. sigh."
Finally decided to woman up and visit a psychiatrist today and got told that I had severe anxiety and panic disorder and should've visited sooner. Hopefully will get my life back on track. My mind has exhausted me.,My brother said I deserved it for acting up idk what that even means but it hurt. You gotta take care of yourself cause even your family doesn't always care.
Does anyone else feel like their friends and family secretly hate them and so you are terrified to talk to them and make things worse but you’re probably just being paranoid?,"Just me? I feel like all of my friends actually don’t like me and “put up with me,” or that every good relationship I’ve ever had I’ve ruined—even though when I’m being rational I don’t see anything terribly wrong that I’ve done. I just feel so much anxiety around them, as if my every move could ruin another friendship. Or I get so anxious that I disappear from the friendship entirely and that’s why they don’t like me anymore, because I abandoned them. It eats up at me. I’m so afraid to hang out with my friends because I’m afraid they will think badly of me, but then our friendship drifts apart."
I’m very grateful for my cat,"It’s 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share. "
Anyone just feel cloudy minded from anxiety? Like you can’t think straight but you can still function?,Like does anyone else get the feeling that their head is inflated and pressury and you feel like you can’t think but you can still function just fine? Just wondering if this is just a me thing or not.
Does anyone’s anxiety manifest as irritability or negative thoughts towards yourself?,"I have a lot of physical manifestations from anxiety like chest tightness, nausea, headaches etc., but I find I often get irritable if I’m in a social setting for too long. I’ll snap at the people around me, I get disoriented and withdraw. 

As well, I notice a tonnnnn of negative self talk. Maybe this isn’t so much anxiety, but I notice it nonetheless. For example, I had to write a paper for one of my classes and ended up doing extremely well on it, and I couldn’t just accept that I had done well. I kept thinking things like “oh maybe everyone did well” or “maybe the prof just graded everyone really easily.” I also get irrationally angry at myself for having my anxiety in the first place. I’ll catch myself saying things like “why is your heart beating so fast, my god you’re just getting on the bus, it’s not a big deal.” 

Anyone else? I’m curious!

Edit: Thank you for all the upvotes and comments everyone!!! I really thought the irritability and negativity was uncommon with anxiety, it’s so comforting to know it’s not. Thanks for sharing your experiences with me, it helps me more than anyone will know."
"Does anyone have the thought of, f*** it if I’m willing to take my life, than how can I not be willing to just go live in HAWAII and work whatever shitty job I have to just to be there…?","Hawaii isn’t some cure for my mental health issues (and I just say Hawaii because I live in the US).   
 But I saw this documentary about HAPPINESS and it was about who the happiest people in the world seem to be. I noticed a lot of them were little villages of people on small off-the-grid tropical islands. Living off fish and the islands fruit. Simple life living, no bullshit societal stipulations that f\*\*\* with your head…. just the sound of a breeze, the crashing of waves, and the beautiful sunny landscape filled with the stillness of nature. 

Maybe no one relates to this. 

Maybe this is just wishful thinking. 

Maybe it’s just the concept of “if I’m going to feel like hell, I might as well feel it in an absolutely breathtaking place where things are just a lot more chill and peaceful."
I took a shower today!,"I haven’t showered in almost a month beforehand but I finally showered today. With super hot water and was in there for like an hour it felt so nice. I always told my mom about my anxiety and we’re gonna go to a clinic today to check on my body. I’m very scared, very nervous, VERY anxious, but it’s for the best and I know I can’t keep pushing this. Hope it all goes well!!! <3"
I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Merry Christmas guys x"
Guys—for the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! And that’s the best feeling in the entire world."
Words cannot describe how proud of myself I am right now.,"Hands shaking, heart pounding, I told the guy at TSA that I had never flown alone and he reassured me that they were always there to help. Hands still shaking and heart still pounding, I went through TSA keeping a close eye on my valuables. A little less shakily, I found my gate.  Waiting to board. I have never been more proud of myself than I am right now. "
Happy World Mental Health day everyone!,I hope you all have an anxiety free day
DAE get messages from others that you are too anxious to read and then get anxious all over again the longer you don't reply?,"Basically the title. I get so anxious opening work related (and in general too) messages/DM's because of the need to reply since the sender can see that you've read said message to the point of rarely opening them now. Well I feel great for a day and then my anxiety increases more and more the longer I wait to read the message. I'm to the point that I want to let someone else open all of my messages and relay the info to me, but some of the message chains have so many unread messages that I'm now afraid of just seeing/hearing bad news related to not opening the prior message that'll make me even more anxious. 

I'm in this inbetween area it feels like where I keep telling myself that tomorrow I'll open all of them so it subdues my anxiety a bit and this keeps going on daily. I literally have no valid excuse to tell these people either so I feel like I'm just intentionally screwing myself over and probably causing problems (that I haven't even read about yet in the unread messages).

I dug myself this hole and hate feeling anxious all the time from it, but also hate how I feel slightly less anxious just ignoring it.

Edit: Thanks everyone just for even replying, it strangely feels good to know that I'm not alone at all in feeling this way. Tomorrow I'm biting the bullet and going to go through all accounts (or what I can in the time I'll have) I can think of to reply to or delete messages and emails. Typed out a few replies for different situations that I'd been avoiding so I have no feasible excuse now! I'm bound to have a couple angry replies but I figure the quicker I reply the quicker I can sum up our conversation and never talk to them again! Thinking about it in that sense makes me just every so slightly excited to get rid of all the message baggage."
First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I had an anxiety attack in front of my boyfriend and I thought he wouldn't reacted badly to it, but instead he held me if I needed it and backed off if I needed it and I really appreciated it"
Anyone else get anxiety over just making a Reddit post?,"It seems when I want to post something, I'm excited about it because it's a subject of interest and I want to discuss it. But then when I post it and get replies..there's always at least one person who is really rude and implies that whatever Im talking about is dumb. 

Then I get anxiety. I get defensive at times too. Sometimes I get close to deleting the post because I don't like people disrespecting me when I know damn well I don't deserve it"
Who has social anxiety or panic disorder but seems completely normal on the outside?,I Have a bit of social anxiety at certain times and my panic disorder comes on every so often as well. But from the outside I seem completely normal even like mid panic attack. I’m just curious to know how many other people I interact with on a daily basis that are working and living and doing things but still struggling immensely with anxiety ?
Does anyone here also worry they are cringey/annoying all the time?,"I feel insecure and worry that Im not funny just cringey. People have told me Im cringey online but I just eant to know how to not be cringey. Any advice?

I also have a lot of self hate and self doubt. ""Youll never be good enough.""

I just feel so embarassed and ashamed of myself.

Of course Im sure everyone does something cringey once in a while... Im just worrying way to much. 

Thanks for reading

Edit: thank you all for your wonderful advice. Happy holidays and have a great day!"
Today is my cake day AND my actual birthday.,"And for several years I’ve down played my birthday because of anxiety. Anxious about the attention. Anxious about organising a party and no one coming, anxious about everyone forgetting. So I’ve just not told people it’s my birthday and I’ve not organised anything. 

But this year I did tell people at my work. I told people who I’ve made friends with online, I went out for a meal. 

It has been a great day and I think it’s the first time in a long time I’ve really enjoyed my birthday. It also feel great to have let down a wall.


Edit: thanks for all the birthday messages :) love you all."
Hey YOU,"Yes. YOU. The person reading this right now. You're amazing. I'm telling you because you probably don't hear it as much as you deserve to. Because you're battling some really tough things that most people won't ever understand. Because even though you're doing that, and it's hell, you're STILL HERE. I don't know if you realize what a major accomplishment that is, but I'm here to tell you, it's fucking incredible. You're INCREDIBLE. Keep fighting. Keep going. It's going to be okay. I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes (or a lot of the time), but it really will. You're going to have glorious moments of sunshine to make all this rain worth it. Those moments are going to see you through the storms. Because there will be storms. Maybe you're in the storm right now. You'll get through it. Because you're strong, stronger than you think you are. You're incredible and strong, and I know you can do it. I have faith in you. I'm here for you. 
YOU. ARE. AMAZING."
"I can’t even remember how it felt like not suffering from anxiety fuelled depression, I’m 35 and having the worst time of my life. Today, I forced myself to go to the gym despite my inner voice saying I can’t. Feeling great about it.","Thanks to you all, kind internet strangers! My heart feels so warm thanks to your sincere comments; everyone who shared their own stories and everyone who told their experiences, thank you! We are not alone. 

P.S. My very first award, thanks."
"When the day is over, let it go. Don't dwell on what you could've or should've done. Tomorrow is another day and another chance. If it's meant to be, it will come again.","No worry can change the past, it serves you no purpose to dwell on things that cant be changed.  Tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to change how you see and live your life.  

How you chose to view the affects of your past rest purely with you and your perspective on life.  Try find the positives in what comes your way in order to break any negative trends you may have created.

When you find harmony and good in things around you, you'll find yourself.  We have to break the cycle off negativity in our lives in order to be open to the good around us.

Positivity breeds positivity.

I wish everyone happiness in all that you do."
This shit is so terrifying,"I cant stop crying 

I just want to calm down but i cant

I fucking cant 

Im afraid all the time and i cant stop 

Every thought is like an explosion in my brain 

It's like the world is trying to devour me

I just want this to stop but it always comes back, always 

I know its such self pitying bullshit but I cannot convince myself that anyone really likes me, no matter what they say, being alive is just so tiring 

I treat EVERYTHING like a freaking personal attack 
I twist every postive, kind thing the people in my life do for me and turn it into something absolutely unrecognizable

Its disgusting

I cannot make a right decision 

Posting this is wrong 

But I dont know what else to do?

But its wrong 

Writing this out has kind of been therapeutic so there's that? 

Its either I write this freakout to reddit because all other social media is terrifying rn (and people i know inhabit those, ew) or I keep scrolling through the apps on my phone endlessly while I hyperventilate 

I shall add another sad voice to the void, enjoy.
Thank you for reading.
Any helpful tips to deal would be appreciated.
I hope you all are not feeling as panicky as I am :')

Edit: seriously so thankful you all have been leaving so many nice comments :') (and even gave me a gold?? Thank you!) I may not respond to everyone but I am surely reading every comment and am beyond appreciative!"
I brushed my teeth!,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth. 

I'm crying because I finally did it. My teeth might just be saved."
I just ordered food by myself!,I didn’t even know what kind of pretzel I was getting I just pointed at the first thing I saw and said “give me one of those” lol. I’m giddy right now and so proud myself! Just felt like sharing this with someone
Read it and believe it.,"Your anxiety is lying to you. You are strong and great. You can accomplish all those dreams. You are not a burden, you are a blessing. You are great in what you do. Your anxiety is telling you lies in your own voice.

No one gives a shit how you do things. So do it anyway without thinking anything.
Just go on and don't think... You can achieve everything you ever wanted.
Just believe yourself.

Update: You can't run away from your anxieties throughout your life. You have to be bold, confident and brave to face it. And when you face your fears you are going to win and then you will be happy."
Anxiety robbed me of my personality,"And the more I think of this, the more depressed I feel that anxiety has become such a huge part of my life that I forget who I am without it. The person I was without anxiety seems so different and distant. I miss her. I miss her so much."
"Does anyone that has dealt with depression /anxiety pre Covid19 feel even more out-of-sync with their peers even tho “everyone” is struggling with mental health, sadness and anxiety?","I’m just trying to figure out if it’s just me. Some days I feel supercharged and extra supportive of my friends who are struggling and don’t respond to texts, video calls, online game sessions, invitations to virtually hang out, not being invited to virtual gatherings between friends, etc. I’m like “I get it, that’s ok, I understand because I know what depression is like...”

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time. I feel like most of my life I have been unselfishly receptive to what others are struggling with (since I’ve been there so long).

I just don’t know how to relate I guess."
Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program"
Does anyone else get anxious when thinking about time wasting?,I feel like I'm rushing the day and wasting my own time as we don't have all day and it ends up getting me upset and anxious that I've wasted time it's like I've got to plan something at a certain time so can make the most out of my day but it's making me anxious about time
"Foodies who no longer have the energy - I'm writing a cookbook to help people who no longer have the motivation to cook through depression or other issues and instead resort mainly to things like fast food, may I ask what you like to see in it?","Hi everyone!

Please excuse me, I know this is a strange thing to talk about but I was recommended to pop it in here. Please remove it if it isn't allowed (and please excuse my gosh awful English!) !

For those who don't know me (which I'd imagine is everyone) I'm an ex-cook whose been dealing with depression on and off since I was 14.

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!) I would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle !

Edit: Oh my goodness guys! I was expecting this to tank but instead it's taken off ! I want to say thank you so very much for the support, I will do my very best to implement everything you guys have suggested and make it as good as possible!"
"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.","I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse."
DAE's anxienty always make you assume that poeople are mad at you?,"I came to my dorm today to find my roommate studying for his finals so we only greeted each other, I sat down and let him study. He didn't talk to me much either cus obviously, he was studying.

The whole time my conscious self knew that he's not talking to me because he's focused on whatever he was reading. My subconscious self tho, was yelling at me the whole time being like ""He's pissed at you, you must have done something to upset him and he probably hates you for it!""

This happens more than I'm willing to admit. The fact that I'm completely socially incompetent and often misread social cues doesn't help at all. Anyone else like that?"
does anyone else sometimes feel PHYSICALLY sick from anxiety?,"about a year and a half ago i had just found out my partner at the time had been cheating on me for 4 months, i felt stupid and betrayed and i felt like the blood in my body was moving around too fast? like my stomach had flipped and i couldn’t breathe properly and then i started feeling sick, i feel sick all the time. like at least once a day, so i wasn’t worried about it but then i suddenly felt something go up my throat and i had to run to the toilet and i was sick, quite a lot. i cried for a while and forgave them, it happened again but it’s over now and i’m with someone that makes me really happy but some things still make me feel like that, i haven’t been properly sick again since but things like exams and especially my speaking exam that’s coming up (next week) make me super anxious and honestly just getting up and going to school. i feel like i have to put in double the effort to do anything that other people do, and it really sucks."
I’ve just gone 1.5 months without an anxiety attack!,"I haven’t had one since January. Although I had one tonight, I’m glad that I made it this far because it used to be worse. Before, I was getting them a few times per week and it was quite debilitating. I still have work to do. I had one because it was over a topic that I haven’t covered in therapy yet. However, I’m just glad that I’ve made this accomplishment. 

To anyone that struggles, (this is really cliche) it does get better over time. It may not feel like you’re going anywhere, but I can guarantee that you are. Whether it be a small accomplishment or large, progress is being made."
"World Suicide Prevention Day | September 10th! 💚💝❤️ “... You matter! ❤️ Speak out, ... tell someone now, before it’s too late! ❤️”","This is my first time posting. ... I know this is a subreddit related only to Anxiety, but I just wanted to say, ... 

“... You have someone right here, who cares for you, and is open to talk to anyone, about anything, concerns, etc., whatever, ... I can understand, empathize and feel sympathy, and am also very supportive and friendly, so come to me please, if you ever need to talk!” ❤️ “I’m hear for you, ... any of you, and always will be!” ❤️"
A cool anxiety technique I learned,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!"

"Friendly reminder.. unclench your jaw, relax your shoulders, and breath.","I just had to remind myself of this as everything was tightening up. Remember, you’re not alone, love y’all!

Does anyone else hate how easily other people can ruin your day?," A phone call with an angry client, a threatening email from a third party, a slightly insensitive comment, people stopping their conversations when you walk past...

I'm fairly certain that my peers cope with these things just fine. But almost every time they happen to me my day is ruined and I have to constantly seek reassurance from people that everything is alright.

I wish I could learn to just let go of these things instead of them going around my head like a sock in a washing machine for the rest of the day..."
DAE purposely stay up late so that they are so exhausted when they try to sleep instead of tossing & turning due to anxiety?,"I am in college and I purposely stay up late studying so that I am so exhausted that I’ll go to sleep a lot easier than actually trying to get some sleep and dealing with my thoughts about everything I should’ve/should done/do. 

EDIT: Thank you guys for all making me feel not alone in this"
Ever have days where your anxiety is incredibly high for absolutely no reason?,Yeah. It’s one of those days.
"Huge victory, today I faced one of my biggest fears and got a panic attack in return. Took a train and it got stuck between two stations due to a technical problem. I considered pressing the emergency button and prying open the train door. Instead, I embraced the panic attack and pulled through.","I've suffered from a severe panic and anxiety disorder since i was 11. I'm 21 now, still suffering but going to a clinic soon to fix it. My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what? It worked!! I survived the panic attack, i pulled through it and it feels f*cking amazing!! It gave me new hope and i actually believe that i'm able to overcome it. If you read everything, thank you! I just wanted to share my little victory with you :)"
Just one bad interaction can ruin my day. Anyone else?,"It can be simple stuff but like the title says one bad interaction with someone can ruin my day. Example, Going out with my brother to a mall, we both suffer from Anxiety, his social anxiety been way worse than mine and all of the sudden we have some employee following us around and checking on us like we are going to steal something. Idk if they judge us for the clothes i wear or because i dnt look people in the eyes, most of the time i even wear earphones cause i dnt want people talking to me. Anyways my brother gets mad and say ""WTF he is following us for?"" And even if they don't say anything back for that moment on my brain just keep replaying that moment the rest of the day. Or been in the drive thru and asking for stuff and getting the wrong items or missing something over and over same thing happens, my brain just keep thinking about that situation. It gets annoying cause i can be having the best day and all of the sudden something like that happens and there goes my day. Anyone? Leave your story in the comments below."
I did it,"I had my first day of college, and it went well, made it out alive so yay me. ok thank you for reading have a good day :)"
Yesterday I had a panic attack at the dentist.,"Yesterday I wasn’t doing so well. I’m switching anxiety medications, so I’m going through a bit of withdrawal which isn’t fun. I thought about cancelling my dental appointment, but decided to go anyway. One of the nurses heard me state that I was having a bit of a panic attack, and I might need to do the x-rays another time. She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted. 

After my appointment, I sat in my car for a while just thinking. I called my mom to tell her about it, and she started crying too. It’s nice to know I’m never alone. "
Anyone else love automated self checkout?,Many US grocery stores now have self checkout. I can talk with strangers but being able to put on my noise cancelling headphones and use the self checkout is much easier. No having to interact with people. 
I got a job that suits my anxiety!,"I'm very ecstatic, I got a job that literally fits around my anxiety! A family member of mine talked to another friend who works at an auto parts shop and she said she completely understands what I'm going through and the company will take me on! All I do is deliver parts and sweep that's it full time 8 to 5! Not only that but they're accommodating for my group therapy! "
bro im straight up not having a good time,whenever i think about literally anything ive ever done/said i just cringe... i am a cringe
"I've exercised every day for a week now, and I am so proud of myself!","A big part of my anxiety come from how others view me and how fat I am. (167 cm and 85 kg) and as with all anxious thoughts, I know they're a lie but, you know. 

So I started running at night so the chances of being seen lowered then on day 3, I was passed by another runner and instead of thinking, I got more motivated. Now I run during dusk which is an improvement I didn't expect.

It's a small step for a regular person, but a giant leap for me.

Edit: Thanks for all the support! It actually gonna make it even easier to run tonight!"
When people say “trust your gut feeling” means something so different to people with anxiety.,"Not that I expect everyone to understand, but when people ask what your gut feeling is about something, I literally have to shut it down, because my gut feeling is always anxiety??? And I over analyze my gut feeling so much that it turns into negative. I know there’s obvious things that call for going with your intuition, but people who don’t have anxiety don’t realize that we over analyze and fear most decisions. Even when we know what we want, we still fear being wrong. Anybody else? "
"Telling someone with Anxiety to ""calm down,"" is like telling someone with Allergies to ""Stop and smell the roses.""",Just thought I'd share this showerthought.. 
does anyone get really scared of being yelled at?,"One of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. I fear getting scolded more than I fear my future career. Even if I know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, I get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. 

I was scolded once by a strict coach when I was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. After that one encounter, I was so scared that I would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice. "
I Stay Up Late Every Night Because Going To Sleep Means I'll Wake Up And Have To Deal With Tomorrow,"It's usually getting in to work that's the hardest.
I've  started zoloft again and hopefully that will get it under control.
But that anxiety wall starts building as the sun goes down.
What am I going to mess up at work tomorrow? What will I get in trouble for?. 

I think it just feels good to share. I'll get over the wall. I just need to make a few runs at it. "
Does anyone else feel physically weak and tired after going through a long period of anxiety that eventually died down temporarily?,"I had a terrible week. I couldn't bring myself to do much of my school work on time because of my anxiety. By Thursday, I managed to calm myself down significantly but I'm feeling the consequences at the moment. My body is sore, my neck and head hurt constantly, and Once 8 pm hits, I feel like dropping unconscious to sleep (that's how tired I am). Is this normal?

Who else regroups in the bathroom?,"When I'm in panic mode or etc., I find bathrooms to be a useful place to get somewhere alone for a minute to regroup. Only downside? My in-laws think I have bowel issues lol."
Anyone have “career anxiety”?,"I have a constant worry that my current job or prospective jobs are not the “right” decision for my own career development.

Anyone else get that gut feeling that it’s gonna be a bad day and the anxiety just flairs up?,"I feel this right now. I have to work again tomorrow and I feel like I’m gonna log on to my laptop and then see a bunch of “negative” messages from senior workers. 

This job has caused me enough stress that my anxiety has skyrocketed. The amount of anxiety attacks I get, oh boy. I know the solution would be to leave but I can’t afford that right now. 

But does anyone else always get this gut feeling like oh hey today’s gonna be a bad day and then it actually does?"
I signed up for Reddit a year ago this December. It took me almost the entire year to overcome my anxiety about posting for the first time,"I know it doesn’t look like much, but this post was almost one year in the making. Anxiety is a bitch.

Also, words"
"Has anyone found that their ability to read text, write, and spell drastically goes down when anxious?",Just something that has been happening too much lately and was wondering if this could be contributed to anxiety.
I got rid of Facebook and Instagram today after 8 years.,"I couldn't feel better, it's like a weight has been lifted off me and alot of stressful ties cut. Now I can live in the real world without being too sucked into my phone, and the only people that can contact me are the people I want to be able to. For years I lived a very bad life, and now I feel safer it won't come back to bite me."
Dont you hate when you wake up and know its going to be an anxiety day?,"So much is changing and I don't like change, I also don't like confrontation. There's both right now in my life. My husband is starting a new job today and a teacher at work has some stupid beef with me for making a joke. I'm having a hard time dealing with it all at once, it feels like I can't breathe

Any tips would be greatly appreciated"
I get anxiety from posting/commenting on Reddit.,"This sounds so silly, but can anyone relate? I want to contribute to conversations/post things but I worry about downvotes. How STUPID is that? It shouldn’t matter. But here I am, worrying that this post will embarrass me. And if I do post or comment, I seriously worry about it and if I look stupid. Like I’m a complete stranger to everyone anyway. Please tell me I’m not a total freak. The only time I can comfortably post is if I’m drunk and that results in me usually deleting them. And I shouldn’t drink anyway. I just wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT: I should probably add that I’ve been drinking and that’s why I had the courage to post this because I’m a fucking coward.

EDIT #2: I found out this same issue was posted recently. Sorry!"
"Anyone else get this vague, stressful feeling that you have some insurmountable task ahead of you tomorrow, or something similar?","So this may sound a bit vague so bear with me. Often times when I'm feeling incredibly stressed out, over no particular reason, I often get this feeling of stress over the immediate future. It feels like I have some incredibly taxing and difficult task ahead of me the next day and it makes me feel cripplingly anxious and stressed out in the present. 

To me it sort of feels like I have a final exam(or something similar) to do tomorrow, every single day. This is despite the fact that I actually dont have anything stressful to do tomorrow. 

Anyone else get this specific feeling?"
Does anyone else fear phonecalls?,"Basically, I have to admit, I struggle with calls, whether it's incoming or if I have to make one. I become all hot and shivery all of the sudden, and I can feel my pulse going nuts.

I got a 4.0 this semester in college!," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think. 

Y'all got this! I hope anyone who's semester just ended had a great one, and everyone else have a great holiday break and happy holidays in general."
"People who laugh, yell, and mock the people with anxiety and panic disorders are sad people.",They have no idea what we have been through or why we have such disorders. Truly people these days have 0 empathy and yes I mean empathy not respect. No one does anymore not police not nurses and hell definently not most of the general population.
"Wake up feeling fine until I ""remember"" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?","Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed. 

Can anyone relate to this? I'm not sure how to stop triggering this and it's bothering the fuck out of me. I don't want to feel like I can't relax even on the weekend or after work. :/ "
I am so proud of my wife,"My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight. 

We have been working on this for two and a half years and tonight was a major breakthrough. I am so proud of how far she has come."
The worst thing for me about having generalized anxiety is I have anxiety about my anxiety.,"I constantly feel the need to explain to people why I constantly over think or internalize everything. I don't want people to think I'm this crazy, narcissist that thinks the world revolves around me so I explain that I have pretty severe anxiety issues.... and then I worry that I'm that annoying person who constantly feels the need to justify their actions or statements by leaning heavily on a health issue.... so then I apologize for bringing it up so much. 

My anxiety disorder is causing me anxiety. 

I just left a comment about not being able to sleep at night because my brain won't shut down and I can't stop analyzing everything that I said or did throughout the day. It went from 1 to 0 in less than a minute so I deleted the comment because it sounded whiny and a little crazy. Why do I care so much about what other people think? Why do I worry so much about how I come across to others? It's exhausting.

I'm feeling shity, might delete later. IDK 😘"
Something I REALLY gotta get off of my CHEST!,You are awesome. You matter. And I love you even if I don’t even know you. Keep moving forward because you’re worth it!!! <3
The Biggest Problem With Anxiety is that It's Hard to Tell When Problems You're Having is ACTUALLY Caused by Anxiety,"Case in point:

&#x200B;

I've had a tension-like headache for two fucking weeks and none of the doctors I've seen know what's causing it. 

&#x200B;

Anxiety? Could be.

&#x200B;

Not anxiety? Could be.

&#x200B;

Brain tumor? Probably. (This is a joke, but you guys probably get it.)

&#x200B;

That's just making the anxiety worse. "
I start a new job tomorrow. Wish me luck 😁,"I don't have a lot of people to celebrate this milestone with, but I knew y'all would understand the significance. I'm anxious af, but also excited. I think this is going to be good.

UPDATE: it went really really well! Thanks everyone for your support ❤️ I appreciated all of your comments. They helped me stay calm."
"Anyone else feel so anxious yet they instantly ""sober up""/relax when other anxious people are in need of your emotional support?","As the title says, I find that in really tough situations where I'm having a bad day - I instantly feel less tense when I see someone else suffering from severe anxiety. In fact, I always reach out to them (here and irl) and offer them advice which makes me feel better too. Now if only I took my own advice seriously..."
"Anxiety is like having a toddler scream in your ear 24 hours a day. Zoloft is a set of headphones that lets you ignore it occasionally, but doesn't actually do anything to calm the screaming.",.
Depression and anxiety together is the worst.,"Depression makes me want to stay in bed and sleep all the time, and I'm always super tired when I'm not purposely overloading my body with sugar and caffeine.
  
  
At the same time, though, anxiety makes me stay up way longer because I'm constantly thinking, cringing, and panicking internally about some event in my personal life or some work scenario that I could have handled better.
   
  
These two issues mix together like oil and water. Like bleach and ammonia. 
  
  
I feel like I can never win."
One of my favorite phrases my therapist told me to keep in mind when I start to feel anxious...,"He said, “you want to notice your thoughts as they float down the river of your mind, without getting swept away by them.”

Just “noticing” my anxious thoughts, not entertaining them nor judging or analyzing them helps me to de-escalate my worries before they turn into a full blown panic attack. 

I hope this helps in some way."
Didn't go to a party due to anxiety and now I have anxiety because I didn't go,"This is SO silly but there was a little party today at my university and my stomach was twisting in knots about going so I skipped it even though my sorta-friends were going. I just stayed at home for hours pretty much doing nothing, feeling sad for no reason, but I was under the impression we would all go to a club tonight anyways so I figured i'd save up my social energy for that. And my roommates came home and don't want to go to the club anymore, so now I'm feeling awful and anxious and so sad that I didn't go, I SHOULD have gone and now I have so much regret and anxiety that I missed out. I think I would have had so much fun but yet again I feel like I missed out, and wasted my night. This keeps happening, I really have to get better at forcing myself to just do things..."
Got a girlfriend,I finally got over my anxiety of dating after a really bad relationship a few years ago and asked out a girl I had a crush on for a while and she said yes ☺.
Does anybody feel anxious to the point where they want to vomit?,"It happens to me every day and I don’t even know where my anxiety is coming from. 

Edit: WOW. Thank you everyone for commenting and giving advice (honestly did not expect to get an answer)! I hope you can all pull through and feel better <3"
DAE experience 'burnout' for several days after one very rough day?,"After a day where I'm an absolute mess and have to push through some very tricky anxiety I'll end up feeling burned out for about 2 weeks afterwards. I struggle to eat and I wake up exhausted every morning and feel dizzy and in general have a much higher baseline of anxiety that usual.

Anyone else have this? Could it be something like Adrenal Fatigue?"
Any other chronic jaw clenchers here?,I woke up this morning with AWFUL pain in my teeth because i spent the night with my jaw locked shut. I do this when I’m stressed. I also tend to grind my teeth. I’m always so tense! My teeth are in a world of hurt today.
Slow down. It may feel like you have to keep up with the fast pace of everyone around you but you absolutely do not have to.,"I've been more mindful about the speed of which I talk at, and I've noticed that I think I may be talking at a speed I'm not too comfortable at. Maybe it's my unconscious nature to do so, in order to 'keep up' with people. I hope to get in the habit of slowing my speech down just a tad so as to stumble and stutter less. 

I've also been trying to think more about the state of my body. 
Is your body relaxed right now? Do you shake your leg? Why aren't you still? Unless you're exercising, you should be still and calm. "
Today I managed not to look away when a girl made eye contact.,"I'm usually very shy and insecure around girls. If one makes eye contact I look down or away immediately especially if I find her cute.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

EDIT: Thanks for the award stranger. I'm glad it cheered someone else up too!"
Does anybody else feel mentally exhausted from battling with there anxiety constantly?,"People use the term ‘mentally exhausted’ and I’ve never understood what they ment, but I do now, I’ve had severe anxiety and daily panic attacks for 6 years now (turned 26 yesterday) and for my birthday my girlfriend arranged for us to go on holiday for 4 days, which of course on 1 hand I need the break, but on the other i didn’t want to be killing the holiday by not wanting to do stuff, so I got myself some backup Valium to carry around with me in case my anxiety was to get to a point where I could not cope, I’m on my last night now going home in the morning and I did not end up having a single tablet other than my daily propranolol, and I’m super proud of myself I have did everything from going to fair grounds to shopping in busy town centres and markets, I’ve been out from morning until night every day, which is obviously good, it has took me so long to get to this point and it has not been without it’s set backs, and I mean really bad set backs ones where I feel like I’m back at square 1 again, but I always dust myself off and start again, but recently I feel like my brain could do with a rest, I’ve had panic attacks daily while I’ve been here but you would of never been able to tell, my symptoms seem to change every now and then, at the moment mine are- not being able to take a deep satisfying breath or yawn, pains in my chest and pressure in my head, and insomnia, but you no what guys I’m happy believe it or not I just wish I could be normal again, but until then  I will just keep plodding on and hopefully get there 1 day. "
Does anybody else find themselves clicking the 'discard post' button a lot because they are afraid of being judged?,"Edit: Wow, I didn't know that many people had the same issue. Thanks for everyone's feedback!"
Apparently May is Mental Health Month and I’ve officially decided to seek help!,"I’ve been on medication before and I don’t love it-but that’s not to say that it doesn’t help. I just didn’t like it for me. However, I’ve never really had continued help. So now that covid is taking over and my anxiety is getting a lot worse I’ve officially decided to reach out to some therapists in my area. Fingers crossed I find a good one!

Edit: thanks so much for the love everybody! we are all in this together and need to do what’s best for all of us, individually. 💜"
Does really bad weather soothe anyone else's anxiety?,"For a very long time now any time there's a bad storm or something, it makes my anxiety go down so much. To the point I like to put on storm sounds when I sleep at night. I really don't get it, I was deathly afraid of storms when I was a kid. But I check the weather all the time to see when it's going to storm. I sleep better and even feel better and more energized all day. I hope I'm not alone."
Does anybody else feel mentally ill with chronic anxiety?,"I know it is a mental illness in itself but I’m talking about constantly feeling “off”.. like way less intelligent than you used to be, hard to process your thoughts in to words so they come out jumbled or silly sounding, constant headaches and just feeling like you’re on autopilot looking in to someone else’s life.. Idk I’ve been dealing with this for 2+ years and I still find it hard to believe it’s just anxiety. I’m terrified it is something else that the doctor’s are missing which I’m sure is just anxiety fueled hypochondria lol. "
Does anybody else feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations?,"I (30M) definitely feel more comfortable in one-on-one conversations compared to group conversations. When it comes to group conversations, my anxiety levels go though the roof to the point where I can’t function properly."
It’s that time again.,"Just in case nobody has told you in a while, unclench your teeth.  Relax your shoulders.  Take some deep breaths through your nose, hold them for a few seconds, and release them.  Now, just breath until you’re able to sink in to your bed or your seat with your eyes closed. Whatever is stressing you can wait for a few minutes.  You deserve peace."
Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous. I definitely believe this 'element' of my anxiety is rooted in something from my childhood, but exactly what that something is I'm not too sure. Do any of you guys have heightened anxiety when it comes to noises, and if so, have you found any coping mechanisms?"
This is what I have to say to my OCD anxiety.,🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.,"Like right now I’m freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and I’m at a friends house, it’s 4:00 am and I’m cold and I don’t have a blanket but I don’t wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn’t turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn’t even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out."
I built a free mental health app after being stuck in my tiny studio in NYC,"After being stuck in my tiny studio for a month due to Covid-19, I started playing around with mental health apps out there. However, I noticed that most of them require at least 10 mins or more for me to consume the audio content and I often run out of patience trying to finish them. I wanted an app that you can use without reserving much of your time.

"Anyone else think they come off as rude in social settings because you're too scared to talk, resulting in silence?","Sometimes I just don't know what to say when I talk to people, so I just stay silent. I know people have told me I come off snobby or rude when I don't speak to them, but sometimes I don't know what to say to them or I'm too anxious to talk. I've had people tell me they thought I hated them initially because I wouldn't talk to them. That totally was not the case. 

Does anybody else feel like this?"
I deactivated my Facebook and my anxiety had decreased by so much!,The daily pressures of seeing everyone’s posts and keeping up on every ones lives. I’m over the drama. I feel great no longer having Facebook! I highly suggest taking a break from social media for a while if you’re feeling overwhelmed with life.
My supervisor remembered my mood scale!,"I track my moods in my journal each day, from red, orange, yellow, green, and blue for an awesome day. It came up maybe once in a conversation how I track my anxiety levels.

Today was a rough day and my supervisor asked  what kind of day it is. I told her orange leaning towards red, but it really meant a lot that she remembered and wanted to know how to make it better.

Might be minor, but I think it shows how having supportive people around can be so helpful. The day is looking up at least.

Sending good vibes ❤️"
"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity","I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety? How have you personally dealt with this kind of struggle? Are the people around you supportive, or do they still hold extremely high expectations for you?"
Does anyone else lose their appetite when anxious?,"I’ve been anxious since I was a kid. It’s been pretty consistent my whole life but in times of stress it gets considerably worse. 
I 
just graduated college, which was a massive accomplishment for me, but I have been very high stress the last couple of months due to the anxiety of starting my “adult life”. Something that correlates with that is my loss of appetite to the point where all I can eat all day is one bagel, sometimes even less. Anything more and I either feel extremely nauseous or I start gagging when trying to eat. 

These last few months I have dropped quite a bit of weight and people keep commenting on it, telling me I look good. Which only makes me feel more anxious, mostly due to the fact that I know it’s an unhealthy consequence of my anxiety that I have no idea how to deal with. 

My question is, does anyone else ever feel this way? And if so what do you do about it?"
Dont be me. A message to young people with anxiety.,"Im a late 40s guy who has lived with various forms of anxiety for a long time. 

I thought I could build a 'safe' life by avoiding. Constructing walls to keep the feelings of fear at bay. Keeping friends at a 'safe' distance. Staying up late at night so as to avoid daytime problems of the world. Work falling away. If I could just keep the fear and discomfort away 'today' I will let tommorow feel far away.

Except my tommorow has come. Living in a cold basement sleeping on bags of clothes. Only my phone and a cat by my side. I let anxiety master me, it tricked me into short term thinking and now my life is dark.

Dont be me. Deal with your issues. Dont avoid, the short term relief it brings is an illusion. Dont be me.

Edit. Thanks for all the replies. Ive often advised others not to lose hope, and I will now take that advice. Dark times overshadow at times but are not permanent. Hope you all know nobody is alone with this, thankyou again."
"Its a saturday night, I'm at home and bored. I'm gonna go out alone and see if I have fun, wish me luck!","-Edit
Thanks everyone for the support, I had a fun night and didn't have any anxiety at all, it was uncharted territory for me because I moved to this city about 3 weeks ago and I don't know anyone who lives close to me. Seeing all the replies telling me to have fun definitely made it much more fun too because, I accept that I'm a bit of a attention whore. Thanks again everyone, I love this subreddit."
I asked to change the tv at the doctors,"I was sitting at the doctors waiting for my husband to finish when the 700 club came on the tv talking about how Jesus healed mental and physical disabilities. I thought about just going to the car, but i finally asked about changing the tv. Unfortunately they just gave me the remote and some older people had just sat down looking directly at the tv. I wanted to change it to CNN but was afraid of them labeling me as a young liberal listening to fake news. So i changed it to local news. So now listening to a million commercials, but none of them claiming I can be cured by allowing Jesus into my heart.

But I did it!! I'm really proud of myself."
"After years and years of putting it off, I finally made an appointment with a counselor.","I don't really have anyone to tell, and this is a major accomplishment for me. I almost feel like crying. I don't have a good reason why I didn't do this sooner, but I'm really happy that I finally did.    

Edit: Holy cow, I was not expecting all this overwhelming love and support. Thank you all so much. I really do appreciate each and every one of you. I've never seen a more supportive subreddit. Thank you. :')"
"Does anyone else find that once you get rid of one source of anxiety, another will immediately replace it?","I've been doing a lot better lately with not panicking over work and social events and making life plans. But I am getting weird anxiety over how I look and feeling super self conscious about my appearance all the time.

I've no idea why, it's not been much of an issue before. I definitely don't need a new thing to worry about! It's so exhausting that stresses like this never seem to truly stop, even when I think I'm getting better. 

Edit: I finally managed to read all these comments now I'm home from work. Thank you everyone for making me feel like I'm not on my own in this! Some of you have made me think I might need to try the doctor/therapist route again because I think I can only get so far on my own. Overall though, today was a good day! I hope you have all had a good day too :)"
Probably gonna get lost in here.... but,"A few months later, I went back  to the restaurant where I had a massive panic attack while with friends, and ate a meal on my own!


Edit: can't believe this got so much attention. Thanks guys :) and thank you for silver!"
"I did all my laundry, cleaned my room, and turned in all my assignments today.","Obviously what normal people can do on a regular basis, and I'll probably be withdrawn from law school for absences, but today I am doing ok. Love u all and wish the best for you."
I wish I knew what it was like to not have anxiety,"Anxiety has controlled my entire life, it controls everything. I can’t even sleep anymore, I’m always too anxious and sick to eat, I can’t even drink water without feeling like there’s poison in it. Eh I guess this was a stupid little rant but man FUCK anxiety"
I get anxiety during anxiety about myself wasting my life having anxiety and not being able to enjoy it. Wasting precious time. Literally anxiety about anxiety? How do I break this loop?,"I get the physical sensations of anxiety each morning I wake up. Doesn’t matter what I do. CBT, meditation, mindfulness, meds (although no more) etc.

This in turn sets the tone for the day no matter what I do, then I get upset that I always feel like my body thinks it’s dying in fight or flight.

It drains me and fatigues me and then I make mistakes at work and affects my attention span. 

Then I always end up being in a state of having more anxiety because I’m scared about always having anxiety.."
"Does anyone else feel straight addicted to their phone, even though you feel as though it just intensifies anxiety?","I know people who literally leave their phones just off for hours or never check them and I’m over here like obsessively checking shit every five seconds. Partly because I totaled my car and can’t really go anywhere currently/not much to do in my town that’s walkable and partly because I use social media a lot to find things I need.  Like currently:

Moving states in two weeks and have about a month to find a roommate once I move. Facebook is great for this.

Also need a new (to me) car in the next month. Also need to use social media/the internet for this.

I like concerts so I follow a lot of artists and that’s how I get a lot of free tickets or pre sale codes.. and this requires scrolling through IG to find usually. IG is either mind numbing entertainment or just toxic to me. Seems to be no in between.

I don’t want to be a slave to my phone and anxiety and it’s not like I have no hobbies I can explore. I kind of just feel crippled by anxiety and it’s ironic my go to place is my phone. And if I DON’T indulge my brain and check whatever it is=anxiety. Catch fucking 22z

Most of the time, no one even gives a shit what I post anyways so I don’t know why I’m posting this in the first place. One of the only true positive places on my phone is the random acts of amazon subreddit. Everything else is just comparison, boredom, wondering why people don’t talk to me (which I know I partially do to myself), wishing I was not in physical pain all the time and posting about it and then immediately deleting cause I feel stupid afterwards... you get the gist.

I’m just in a super weird head space right now and I don’t feel very supported living at my narcissistic mothers house til I move. Or really much at all lately. Idk. I can’t even tell if it’s all just in my head at this point. I wake up anxious and sad and go to bed anxious and sad and I just want to be happy dude.

God sometimes I just wish cell phones didn’t even exist still. Simpler times. I don’t know what I need but all I know is I feel like I’m annoying the only people I have in my life who I feel I can truly confide in, because you can only listen to someone complain about something for so long....and it’s all just stupid anxiety.

I’m so over it. So much. 

Tips?"
I just want to say,"Everyone here who has anxiety including me were are strong. We are fighting these anxiety and panics everyday and the people around you don't even know it. In public people always assume I am so calm but I am not lol I am fighting hard to not look crazy and let my anxiety take over. So to my fellow anxiety ridden redditors, keep fighting

Edit: I can't reply to everyone but your welcome🧡"
Every time someone is aggresssive with me it entirely ruins my day,"For instance, last night with friends I made the mistake of laughing at something someone said that wasn't supposed to be funny (that was truly my fault, laughing at this was disrespectful from me, I only realized it later), and the person talking replied quite angrily to me something like ""get out if you don't want to listen"".

And I'm still anxious about it, it's still stuck in my brain and ruining my day. The problem is that it happens even when I haven't done anything wrong and someone is just being completely mean to me.

I just can't get past it before a long time and it's annoying to not to be able to think properly because of that. I used to suffer from severe social anxiety in the past (that 'solved itself' progressively when I was a teenager) but that problem I described never disappeared, and I have no idea how to solve it.
Thanks for reading !

edit : I definitely need to check the titles for mistakes too"

Did your child self think that your adult self would be completely confident and have it all figured out?,"When I (f26) was in school I always imagined that by mid-20s I’d be completely comfortable in my own skin and wouldn’t give a shit about what other people thought. I just assumed that came with being an adult. Yet here I am, still feeling like I’m at the bottom of the food chain in social situations, and still just as anxious and doubtful of myself as I was 10 years ago.
It’s so weird. On paper I’ve achieved so many of the things I had hoped for myself... I should feel good about myself by now, or at least have enough evidence that I’m not a total piece of shit. 

Childhood me would be saying “how can you still not believe in yourself? How can you STILL be living so fearfully?” 
At this point I honestly don’t know what it will take to prove to myself that I am a perfectly capable human being. Anxiety wins every time.

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your responses!!! I resonate with so many of you and it’s comforting to know I’m not alone in this!! I started CBT a few weeks ago and can’t say it’s been particularly helpful so far, but I plan to stick it out and hope for the best. "
Just got engaged!,I was so so nervous but it went well and she said yes. So happy. 
Im tired of people saying there has to be a reason why I'm anxious.,"Can I not wake up anxious or it suddenly come on? People act like ""oh you're fine"" if you have no specific reason for the anxiety. I have generalized anxiety disorder and binge eating disorder. I can't help it sometimes and when I talk to someone about it, they brush it off like it's not a big deal because I can't figure out why I'm anxious. 

I woke up wanting to eat my whole fridge today. Is there really a giant reason? No. People say ""just eat then"". They don't understand that if I do right now, idk if I can stop myself. You know? It goes with OCD too. You can't stop thinking about it until you act on the obsession.

Sorry for that rant. If anyone would like to talk about it, I'd be happy to possibly make some new friends!"
SOOO annoyed with anxiety’s physical symptoms?????,"Hi peoples! Does anyone else just get so fed up with the physical and health related symptoms that come with anxiety? It’s SO many it’s just ridiculous - sweating, dry mouth, upset stomach, nausea, difficulty breathing, ear ringing, fatigue, confusion, dissociation, headaches, insomnia, heart racing.... and honestly so many more! The amount of physical symptoms drives me nuts... because I experience ALL OF THEM! On and off at random :/ anyone else relate? It always makes me feel like I have something more wrong with me than just anxiety that I have some crazy underlying illness.."
does anyone else look forward to sleeping until your head hits the pillow and 85737473 thoughts run through your mind?,"i love sleeping. i hate laying in bed for two hours past bedtime because i can’t stop thinking about everything and anything, and then waking up throughout the night with a stupid thought."
Anyone ever had anxiety that makes you not want to eat?,"For a little over a month, I have been having some pretty bad bloating, loose stool, inability to eat a large meal because of that bloating feeling, lots of gas and belching.  My doctor seems to be certain that its my anxiety; given I am healthy, no family history of any serious illness, and relatively young.  However, as we do, I cannot shake the feeling something serious is wrong with me and its affecting my every day life quite a bit.  I feel hungry and my stomach growling, but when I eat its hard to finish a meal.  I am actually SCARED of meal time because I am worried I cant finish the entire meal.  Plus, I have lost a few pounds over the past month which is only making me more nervous."
Does anyone else have intense fear that they’ll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

*(edit: i did not expect this to get so many attention i dont have time to reply to everybody but just know ive read all the replies and i appreciate them so much! its so comforting to know that im not the only one who feels this way <3 )*"
Small victory: I managed to control a suicidal anxiety attack before it got too serious.,"Every day with anxiety and depression is a challenge, but it feels nice to count up these little wins. I've been having a lot of bad days for the past month or so and I've been trying to figure out how to cope. Happiness/contentment does seem far away and even impossible at times, and in the case today, it led to nearly catastrophic panic attack today.

I'll admit, it's been a long while since I've had suicidal ideations, which makes the whole experience a fair bit sour for me, but I least I can take solace in the fact that I recognized the signs before things got out of control. Being able to understand, ""Hey, listen, you're having a panic attack,"" and enact a plan of action feels kind of liberating. I was able to stop the attack, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still under high anxiety right now.
"
Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,"It’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea. I know a lot of suggestions come from a good place, but they don’t help."
Worst time for an anxiety attack,"Got pulled over today. I've been pulled over a few times before nothing scary. Today was different though. After the officer walked up to my car I started having a horrible anxiety attack. The officer noticed me shaking and started to press for why I was so nervous. He went back to his car to run my information and a second squad car pulled up. They both walked up and told me I needed to get out because something wasn't right with me and they needed to investigate. As soon as I explained the anxiety and depression I've been battling and showed them my new medication that I recently started. As soon as they saw that they completely shifted and asked if I needed any resources for them and were wanting to get an emergency crisis officer out there to talk with me and get me help. I've already have been getting help, but for some reason it was meaningful how much they wanted to make sure I wasn't going to do anything to myself."
Aced a phone interview and I CAN’T STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,"Three years ago you would’ve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I’d either pass the phone to my family, or I’d be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I’d blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn’t even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They’d be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could’ve said better, the ways I could’ve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn’t write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I’m hopeful it goes well. 

I understand how immobilizing phone anxiety can be, but I swear to you with practice and the right support it really can get better. If anyone ever needs, I’m here to offer calling practice lol, just because it has helped me so much. 

We can do this!!"
I looooove when you finally tell someone you’re anxious and they tell you you’re making it up.,"Has anyone had a situation like this?

I’ve had family, professors, bosses tell me I’m just making up excuses.

In reality, I tense up, get defensive, want to crawl out of my skin. It’s hard to talk about but it’s even worse when I finally do sh my anxiety gets called an “excuse”.

My anxiety makes me come off aloof or like an asshole but I’m just trying to get through it."
Does anyone else here creates arguments in mind and hypothetical scenarios which affects you emotionally?,Whenever I think of some little scenarios which really is happening then later on my mind make it worse like it creates arguments with somebody and i feel like it is real like i felt it emotionally then things got even worse when negative thoughts coming out and i feel if that would happen it would be my fault. There were also times that i even felt i was about to cry just by thinking those things. Can somebody please tell me what i am going through.
Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from who they used to be?,"I’ve been experiencing the beginnings of an attack for the past hour or so and all I can think of is that I’m not “me” anymore. Like I’ve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much. 

EDIT: WOW! I’m almost speechless! Thank you ALL for responding to this. I wouldn’t have known that so many of you felt this way too. I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people! And though I’m saddened that there is anyone that feels the way I do- I feel a bit more fortified that I’m part of a larger whole- and army if you will, that is willing to not give in to this problem. Let’s do our best to take the opportunity to become someone else- to become someone better! 

We got this!"
Isn't anxiety great when all you want to do is sit around because you're mentally exhausted but your brain convinces you that you're going to get cancer/heart disease/fucking every illness ever from not exercising,But you still don't exercise bc you're exhausted and have no motivation to do anything and then there's this endless cycle of beating yourself up? Absolutely love it.
Does anyone else get tired of people telling them to exercise as if thats a cure-all?,"I know exercise is a wonderful tool, and can be great at helping get rid of that excess energy while also helping maintain good health. But sometimes it feels like being told ""have you ever considered exercising or dieting?"" invalidates my current efforts to healing myself. I'd just like to be supported for finally reaching out to a psychiatrist and therapist. "
Does anyone else get really bad anxiety when it comes to talking on the phone?,"I have trouble making calls or even answering the phone for important conversations. I can’t rationalize it at all, but every time my phone rings I just get this terrible knot in my stomach and let it go to voicemail to avoid the conversation. Does anyone else experience anything similar? If so, do you have any tips for how to deal with this?"
Anyone else call in sick for work because of extreme anxiety and you're exhausted from trying to act 'normal'? And then feel really guilty? Argh!,I guess the title says it all :/
Does anybody else feel like your anxiety has totally killed your curious and creative mind? Read more inside.,"What’s up y’all, hope you are all doing well.

Recently came to a bit of a sad but interesting realization. I was reflecting on who I used to be and what I used to think about when I was a young immature boy in high school and I realized something.

My mind used to be so creative and curious back then. I’d always think of crazy what if scenarios, where things came from, imagined my own world, drawings, silly stuff and interesting thoughts.

Now that I am older I have realized my mind has lost that spark. The only thing that ever occupies my mind now is what I did in the past, what I’m gonna have to do in the future, what this all means for me and if I’m doing good enough.

I just think about my problems all the time and what’s plaguing me and if I did the right thing or if I fucked up in life.

It’s kinda because it’s a self-repeating cycle. These thoughts only breed the same thoughts. So I’m like stuck in this weird unoptismistic limbo.

Anybody feel this way ever or make this realization? Thanks."
"Does anyone else have this thing where if strangers laugh near you, they must be laughing at you?","**EDIT:** Wow I didn't think I'd get this many comments. I'm doing my best to reply, stay strong everyone! 

I used to get bullied a lot, and it happened for many years. Kindergarten to like 10th grade, so it's kind of become ingrained in me and it's hard to completely shake it. I'm almost 25, so it feels ridiculous. 

I especially have this with groups of teenagers, I'm genuinely afraid of them lol

If I'm in a group I might not even think of it, but alone is a different story.

What's your experience been with this? Did you eventually get over it? "
I finally did it!,"For lunch today I went out to my local McDonald’s, and I actually sat down and ate my food inside, without any friends or family there! 

My main thing is I hate going places alone because I feel like everyone is watching me, but when I was eating I just focused on eating and texting my friends. I’ve been meaning to apply for a job, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to walk into the store to ask about it."
I’ve applied for two jobs!!,"I just wanted to share some good news. I’ve always been terrified of getting a job, but I’m trying my best to be brave. I’ve applied for a job at a grocery store, and I just applied for a job at a doggy daycare. I feel like because I don’t have any past experience it’s going to be really hard to get a job but I’m going to just apply anyway. Better to try and to fail, than to not try at all. I’m so scared of getting a job but I really want to get moving forward in life. Wish me luck!! 

Edit: ahhhhh thank you all for your support I’m so happy and excited!!! I’ll probably post when I get a job!! Time to make me some money!! "
to everyone reading this ...,"to everyone reading this, thank you for still being here. anxiety is a bitch! nobody likes the draining feeling in your gut. that shakiness in your hands. that awful self-doubt. YOU ARE HERE! you’re defeating it every time you open your eyes the next morning. 

keep in mind that you are a fierce ass human being! only you can do what YOU can do! you are powerful, you are strong. and you are deserving of love! 

have a wonderful day today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and onward! fuck anxiety!"
Going non verbal when you're upset/stressed?,"Does anyone else go nonverbal when theres too much going on and your stressed out and have major sensory overload. I was forced to a family members house for the holidays and I just want to cry, there is absolutely no privacy, only two bedrooms so I dont even get to escape the people and socialization because my bedroom is the couch. I can hear every noise anyone in this house makes and I just want to punch something. When I get like this it feels physically impossible to talk and people just keep talking to you even though you clearly dont want to. this was just a little bit of a rant because I needed it, but i was wondering if anyone else goes non verbal in stressful situations."
A week with no panic attacks!!,"This time in January I was having debilitating panic attacks literally every day/all day and lost so much weight and became almost underweight because of it...6 months later, I am in therapy and on medication and just reached my first week without a single panic attack in 6 months, in addition to getting back to a healthy weight!! Wooooo!"
Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.
Anyway, I can only really come out of my shell once I'm drunk, I'm pretty bad at introducing myself to people unless I am wasted, so alcohol is pretty essential to my way of life I suppose.
But when I finish drinking, oh boy do I worry too much. For example, last night I was drinking with my friends and everything was going brilliantly but now I'm really worried about what kinda impression I gave to some people and whether or not I said something offensive. I know I at least blew my chance to get some action last night but that's ok, there are bigger issues at hand. I also worry I bring up my issues too much and bring the whole atmosphere down. Sorry for the rant, and thanks for your time if you did choose to read through this, I hope you all lead long, fulfilling lifes.

P.S. Idk if I should start going to counselling for issues like this, do you think it could be beneficial to someone like me?"
"""In 3 hours it'll only be 1 hour until I have to go to work... In 2 hours it'll only be 1 hour... In 1 hour...""","Why am I like this? I don't go in until 4 for my part time job, yet it's like work controls my entire day even when I'm not there. I want to be productive on my own time here at home, but I can't seem to relax enough to get out of bed and stop looking at my phone."
Does anyone else shut down when being yelled at?,"(M24) Whenever my mom is in a bad mood or pissed at someone or something. I feel like as if I have to walk on eggshells around her. If I take too long to do something or do it wrong she yells at me. Don’t get me wrong I love my mother to pieces but when she’s yelling at me my mind kind of shuts off, I can’t even think of a response and even if I do it never comes out right. I start stuttering and my anxiety shoots to 100. 

Then I get the usual thoughts of being useless, a failure etc. The rest of the day I feel like absolute garbage and I accomplish nothing other than laying in my bed. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Have you found a way to deal with it and not feel like trash?"
I did it!! I left my house for the day and had fun!,"Today was a really really good day, I left my house for like 11 hours!!! I got past my anxiety and just smiled through the day. I'm sitting on my couch right now after a long day away from home and I feel so calm and sort of relieved. I feel happy, happy that this day was actually really good. My god I almost never leave my house and when I do my head turns into chaos but today it was just calmness. I'm so so surprised. Most of all I'm proud of myself :D I feel great!!!"
Ever feel overwhelmed by the amount of evil in the world?,"I'm a bit of a history buff, and I made the mistake of watching some documentaries on the fascists of the early 20th century recently. Naturally they discussed things like the Holocaust, the Red Terror, and other atrocities of that era.  That shit really gets to me, and lately I've found myself being overly sensitive to every terrible thing on the news as a result.  A college girl goes missing, a boy is murdered by his step-dad, etc; you get the drift.  It can be a little over whelming sometimes.  I just don't understand how human beings are capable of doing such horrible things to one another.

Does anyone else struggle to process this stuff, and how do you deal with it?

**EDIT: I've been reading all of your comments for the last day, and I just wanted to thank everyone.  You tend to *assume* people feel the same way you do on common sense issues like this, but actually seeing individual responses and everyone's different ways of coping is very therapeutic.  It's nice to know I'm not alone.**"
Does anyone else get anxiety when they are waiting on someone to answer them?,"Whenever I send text messages and it takes someone an unusual amount of time to answer I find myself getting more and more anxious. To the point where I start being concerned for their health and well being, and then to the point of convincing myself they are mad at me or don’t want to talk to me anymore. What do you guys do to calm down in a situation like and not let your mind go crazy?"
it’s okay if you need to take a break,"no matter what race you are, it’s okay to sign off for a while and look after yourself. the world is stressful and the anxiety with it is uncontrollable, but your health is the most important in times like these. stay safe <3"
Slow Down. You are getting more than enough air.,"You are getting enough oxygen. Slow down your breathing. Oxygen is all around you, it is infinite, there is an abundance of it. You are in no danger of running out of it.

One of the most insidious symptoms of anxiety attacks is that you convince yourself you aren't getting enough oxygen. Then you make it true by hyperventilating.

I wanted to write this to help anyone going through what I go through on a near-daily basis, convincing myself I need more air, need to breathe harder, that I'm not getting enough oxygen.

Breathe only enough to power your body in the present moment. Don't worry if you will need more air later; you can - and will - get that later. A small breath is enough for now.

Your body is in fight or flight mode right now. It's hoarding oxygen to try and deal with imminent danger. It thinks you need a burst of energy to fight something, or sprint away. Your body is being silly, tricked by your mind. **There is no physical danger; you are safe and you know it.**

You control your body, just like you control your mind. Both of them are tools you have at your disposal. Neither controls the other, neither controls you. Right now your mind is demanding more oxygen from your body, as if it knows better. How *dare* it.

Focus on your body instead. Feel your arms, legs, your muscles. Are they running out of oxygen? No, they aren't. Right now, your heart is pounding because you are breathing too hard. There's too much oxygen, not enough carbon dioxide, you are hyperventilating and your heart is working doubletime to deal with all of that.

Your body knows exactly how much oxygen it needs. Don't be breathing until your mind tells you ""that's enough."" Breathe only until your actual body is content.

Try this if you are going through a panic attack.

On your next exhale, pause for a while before your next inhale. This will take some willpower. It will feel wrong, like you are suffocating, depriving your body of what it desperately needs. That is a lie. Do it anyways. You may start to feel a sensation in your head, almost like excess blood is draining from it. Whatever it is, don't run from it. That's the *calm* you are looking for. That's the carbon dioxide you've been depriving yourself of, and the real thing your body desperately needs.

Take in relaxed inhales. Your lungs do not need to be at full capacity. You may have to fight your mind on this. Just remember **you are getting enough air**. Your mind is being silly, you need to whip it into shape. Some things, like breathing, must be surrendered to your body. Make sure you relax when you exhale, do not contort your abs to squeeze out all the air in you.

Remember that inhaling is the only part of breathing that takes any energy. Exhaling is simply letting go."
I asked for a different lid today,"Today I went to Starbucks, ordered my drink and with little hesitation asked for one of the lids without a straw. Now to some this may seem like an everyday thing but for me this was a big step. After that I went to my first ever lash lift appointment. I was so unbelievably excited to treat myself to this. I laid down, closed my eyes and the woman began my treatment. I knew from the beginning I had to keep my eyes closed for a good hour and a half but, I had no idea how I would react. Once she had the perm solution on and she took her hands away from my eyes to let it sit it all sank in. I immediately started to feel dizzy and like I needed to open my eyes IMMEDIATELY. Now, a few years ago I would have just sat there through my anxiety attack and just dealt with it because I didn’t want to bother her. Today, I very politely explained to her that I needed to have it taken off and I would still pay her for the service. She was so kind and understanding that she didn’t charge me for anything and told me I could always come back and try again another day. Again, to some people this would sound like a failure. I failed to complete the treatment and I felt so overwhelmed, embarrassed, and upset. But, I asked for a different lid today. And that’s a win in my book."
My anxiety makes me feel that I am running out of time and I am only 21,"I constantly keep giving myself markers or what I should be doing at my age, or what I should have accomplished till I am say 25, find love. 
I keep feeling like I could have achieved so much till my age but I didn't and now there's no going back. 
It's like my 20s are the years I must do everything, be the best version of myself but I constantly fail to do so, because of which I am and will remain a failure.
I feel like I'm running out of time."
90 days.,"Almost jumped 14 stories 90 days ago. Hungover, isolated, ashamed, totally hopeless. It was Christmas and I had zero will to live. Jumping made total rational sense. The end of all this pointless suffering. But I didn't. 

I called the hotline. I got help. I saw a psychologist. Diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. But also took a look at my self reported levels of drinking. Explained what alcohol actually does to the brain. He told me in patients with depression and anxiety who also drink, if they get sober their symptoms get easier to manage or even disappear completely.

I quit cold Turkey. My symptoms decreased 50% in frequency and 60% in severity. I'm no longer suicidal. When I get negative automatic thoughts I notice them. When I get in a thought loop I can break out.

Please, if you are suffering and drinking, give it a try. You have nothing to lose. I am going on a retreat tomorrow and I'll be on a flight for a bit, but I'll answer any questions and reply to all comments."
things anxiety has taken from me,"* Good memories - I struggle to remember the nice and the fun things. My personal highlight reel is all the times that I did something embarrassing, awkward or badly
* Ability to make decisions - I can't even plan my day without questioning everything. Should I do something more environmentally-friendly? Should I invite a friend, and would they even say yes? Do I have chores to do instead? Do I deserve this? 
* Ability to think clearly - I feel like I live in a fog of questioning everything and feeling sad and cut-off. I don't know what is normal any more. 
* Self-confidence - I went to Paris at 18 and China aged 20 where I didn't know anyone. This weekend I haven't been to the music festival at the end of my street because I think it will stress me out too much. 
* Zest for life - I used to plan the things I wanted to do and see, and I'd go travelling at every opportunity. Now I'd be quite happy if I could just get through the week without panicking and/or hating myself.

Sharing to get this out of my system and hope someone else understands."
Anyone else get really anxious any time your phone vibrates?,"I don’t know why, but any time I get a call or text I just get hit with this wave of anxiety to the point that I don’t even want to pick up the phone and look at it, let alone answer.  Anyone else?"

# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‘anti-stress vitamin’ B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It’s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It’s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won’t be disturbed**. Most people don’t recover well enough from their daily stress. That’s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we’ll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‘watch’ our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It’s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it’s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing.

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven’t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven’t checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you’re doing it. But when it’s done you’ll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we’ll feel.**

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don’t realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‘*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*’  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‘being in the zone’, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It’s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

# Anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritual

Most people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It’s very important we start our day on our own terms. We should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day. Create a morning ritual for yourself that calms you and will give you the necessary strength to deal with your anxiety. 

We shouldn’t sleep on creating a morning ritual! It makes a massive difference if you start your day right. 

Those are my 7 tips for reducing your anxiety right now, so you can be more peaceful and more successful in your relationships, job, and your life.

I have no doubt in my mind that you are capable of defeating your anxiety. You are absolutely able to do it. 

Did you think this article was helpful? If you did, comment below on what you would love to learn about defeating anxiety. If it’s something I have experience with, I’ll write my next piece about it."
Does anybody else get insanely nervous when other people yell in public?,"I'm talking like: somebody yelling in a situation that has nothing to do with you, but you still think A. oh god, what's my responsibility here, and/or B. what if they start yelling at me?  Maybe it's because I got a lot of yells from cars when I was younger (for some reason), I just think they're gonna start yelling at me too.  Wondering if this happens to anybody else."
Anxiety disorder is like having a broken house alarm in your mind which consistently goes off despite no apparent threat being present.,Just my perspective on it. Came up with this when asked about what I/we go through.
"My anxiety should have lost me my job, but my boss is amazing.","I've been dealing with an extreme level of anxiety (like shaking in the morning and throwing up about going to work) and also having other neuro symptoms (disassociation episodes at night, abdominal twitching, and needing an MRI). With all the days I couldn't get out of bed or had a doctor's appointments, I should have been fired.

However, my boss has been amazing about this. He's been totally good with the appointments, checking up on me when I've had to see specialists and had to change meds. He see's me not only as an employee, but as a person that is trying their best and stuff is just going down. 

I hope you all get that boss one day."
I’m crying because the pharmacist treated me like a drug addict,"(UPDATED!)Today l went to the pharmacist to get my prescription of 7 pieces 0.5 mg xanax that my psychiatrist gave me for my generalized anxiety disorder carrying my passport like they asked of me and because in my country people my age don’t have any other id (15) and she refused to give it to me saying she needed an id card and people go around asking for this stuff so l told her l don’t have an ld card and to give me my other prescription of Cipralex and she refused and left the window. It scarred me and l’m scared to ask for my prescription of xanax in any other pharmacy.

Update: l’m so happy right now! I went to the pharmacy again today with my older sister to see what was the problem and there was another pharmacist working there and he was super polite and said again that they accept only an id card and made a phone call for us and recommended another pharmacy chain we could go to who will accept a passport, so we went to the pharmacy and they were super nice also and gave me the meds with no problem. This was my first time ever picking xanax and it was so scary but l got thorough it with your kind words and advice! Thank you all so much everyone who upvoted and replied :)."
"I cooked a whole meal just for myself today and I know it's not much, but I'm kinda proud.","I like cooking and baking especially, but usually I don't bother just for myself. Recently I've been having quite a bit of alone time at home, which honestly usually fires up my anxiety. Atm however, it is still necessary for me to be at home a lot, since I just got discharged from a psychiatric ward a week ago and don't feel ready to start working again quite yet. However, I made it my goal to do progressive muscle relaxation every other day, get out of the house for a walk or something similar once a day and try to eat properly. And I have actually done that in the last couple days :) Anyway, I just wanted to share with someone who understands and thought of you folk. Thanks for reading, pics of the food in the comments if anyone's interested :)"
When you get anxiety because you finally feel relief from anxiety and you’re not sure how long it will last,"I have been struggling hard with overwhelming anxiety over my job and the environment. Earlier today I felt some relief and was actually feeling happy and then the anxiety creeped back in; knowing the happiness will fade and anxiety will take its place. 

Does anyone else experience this?"
Does anyone else also understand that their thoughts are irrational yet they coninue to feel anxious?,"I sometimes do understand that my anxiety provoking thoughts are irrational, such as thinking I'll never find a job, but the moment I get as much as a little hint supporting this I'll go back to thinking that I'll really never find a job."
does anyone else watch TV/youtube to hear/see other people without actually socializing?,i’m introverted and agoraphobic. but i still like being connected with humanity and “interacting” with other people indirectly makes me feel less cripplingly alone and isolated. sometimes i’ll just put something on in the background while i do other things. i just want to hear human voices without the anxiety of being around other people
"Living with anxiety is a lot like driving a car that idles high; you can still get out and go places, but you're going to run out of fuel much faster.",Best analogy I've come up with so far.
Has anyone else ever exerienced a period where they are in a panic attack mode (basically a never ending panic attack),I'm currently in such a period and have no idea what's going on or what caused it. It's been like this for 4 days and i'm struggling to cope. I have no physical panic attack symptoms except muscle twitching but in my mind i'm extremely anxious for no reason and i feel like i'm dying
I survived my interview!,"Well bloody hell, I did it. My interview is done. It went quite well, and I'm likely to get a job as a lab technician. I'm exhausted now."
Does anyone else feel like a psycho while having conversation with yourself in your mind?,"I was just recalling my past and having long conversation with myself in my mind as usual, sarcastically speaking and dark humour made me laugh and I felt like a psycho tbh.

Edit; thank you, yall! It really gives me relief knowing I'm not alone and that it's normal. I mean, I knew it's normal thing to do but I just couldn't help but doubt myself sometimes. 😅"
Does anyone else get upset and hurt when your posts or comments get downvoted?,I just joined reddit the other day and I’m feeling like it’s really not good for my mental health. Whenever something gets downvoted I feel like people are thinking bad things about me or I said something wrong and I feel stupid. It’s like high school social anxiety all over again
"Is anyone else introverted most of the time, but very extroverted in friend groups or people you're fairly close with?","When I have to be in uncomfortable social interactions (large meetings at work, networking &amp;amp; meeting with possible clients at dinners, etc.) carrying on normal conversation and staying ""in the pocket"" is extremely draining.

However, in my groups of friends and acquaintances, I'm one of the most talkative, outgoing, and funny people (my opinion) in the group and it makes me feel genuinely happy.

What does this mean? I understand that the whole concept of introvert vs extrovert isn't black and white, but what can I learn from this? 

Edit: thanks for the responses. A lot of people are saying things like ""well yeah that just sounds like social anxiety"", or ""you're more comfortable around your friends so obviously you'll be more yourself"" but that's not what I'm getting at. I don't just become a ""normal"" member of the conversation when I'm comfortable - rather I tend to dominate it. I enjoy it a *lot*. So I'm wondering if the repressing of my own thoughts and words in uncomfortable situations is sort of causing this buildup of social energy which then gets released when I'm comfortable."
I'm really tired of people just telling me to stop worrying or fearing things,"You think I choose to feel this way? ""Just don't worry about it"" wow thanks, clearly my subconscious just needed a reminder not to worry. Amazing advice, thanks.


I have some really bad fears that I can't get over and I am just at my breaking point. I don't know what to do anymore"
I always feel bad about conversations after the fact,"I feel that I can have conversations with people just fine but afterwards I always regret the way they go. Today I ran into a friend and we chatted for 15 minutes or so and I thought our talk went great (she seemed to be happy with my presence and the conversation flowed well) until after the fact. Now I have intrusive thoughts like “I should have asked her more about herself instead of talking about me the entire time”, “I should have said this but I didn't”, “Did I say anything that upset her?” and “Was my body language off-putting?” Worries like these keep me up at night because I don’t know if these thoughts are the truth or just fabrications from my overthinking. Because of these worries I constantly imagine how my conversations could have gone better. I just wish I could know how people truly think of me because I feel like people put on a fake smile when I’m talking to them when in reality I bore them, annoy them or weird them out."
Anxiety about making noise,"Does anyone else have such anxiety about being loud and making noise? You don’t want to annoy anyone or draw attention to yourself. Making popcorn makes me extremely anxious because it’s me making so much noise. I can’t play the TV or video games loudly out of fear someone will hear. And sexual or romantic activity is the worst noise anxiety. Does anyone else experience this? If so, do you have any advice?"
Hey. Hey you. *gives Internet hug* It's going to be ok,"Sometimes all I want is someone to hug me and tell me it's going to be ok. What's frustrating is that if I tell people this I feel like they'll just be doing because I told them I like it, and not because they actually care or because they actually think I'll be ok. 


Ive been lurking a while here and as shitty as it sounds its weirdly comforting to know I'm not alone, so thank you.

Sorry the body of this post isn't as happy as the title."
Anxiety has completely and utterly destroyed the person I was before.,"Id give almost anything to get my life before back.. :(

Edit: Really didn't think this would get so big. I really appreciate all the love and all of the people reaching out to me. I'm slowly reading through all your comments. Thank you."
Shotout to those heading back to work today after a break,"I know it’s really hard for me, especially being seen/talking to coworkers after a long break, feeling like they’re judging me. Whatever triggers your anxiety at work if you’re heading back in today, my thoughts are with you."
Anybody else feel like they are addicted to rewatching old comedies because the familiarity of it soothes their anxiety?,"I definitely feel like rewatching episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Office soothe my anxiety. And I definitely feel like I use these shoes as a way of distracting myself from the anxiety. I feel it’s because the shows are so familiar to me, and I love the characters so much that they comfort me. 

I even went through a stage where I would finish B99 and then just click right back onto episode one. 

Can anyone explain why I might do this? Does anyone else do the same?"
"I'm too mentally ill to be a ""successful"" person, but too competent to be a total disaster.","And I almost just wish I was a full on fuck up, you know? It somehow feels worse to sit at mediocrity.

When I entered college, I had elaborate plans to become a surgeon. I had good grades and I was motivated, even though I had been a little beat up by a rough childhood. Five anxiety disorders and two suicide attempts later, I graduated with a GPA so shitty that I will never even hope to be a doctor. Not only that, but my biology degree is useless. Still, the theme among therapists and everyone around me was ""at least you graduated!""

Yes, that's what it's come to. At least I graduated. That's totally what I always dreamt my future to be."
Anyone else hate their birthday?,"Today is my birthday. I’m not looking for attention I just need to vent. Every single year I dread my birthday. It’s like I wake up the day of with the false sense of expectation about “my special day” and then am terribly let down that it wasn’t made special. Does that make sense? I don’t want it to be special but still end up being let down. I hate it so much and wish it would just pass like any other day. I’m a grown ass adult and feel like a child because I would rather lay in bed all day than to expect people to make it special, then they try to make it special while just wishing they wouldn’t. It’s selfish, I know. I’m a mess."
I’ve been feeling too anxious lately,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"I delete posts and comments before posting them, because I fear the reaction. Does anyone else get this?","I could write a bunch of text about something, and then I fear that the post/comment will give off the wrong impression.

That I sound like an asshole or that I don’t know enough about the subject. 

Edit: Just came with another example. 
Me and a group of friends have a snapchat group chat. It’s almost the only way to get in touch with them, so that’s what I use Snapchat for.
And when I started writing there and then deleted it, I realized how much I delete texts there.
It’s like every other text I try to write is deleted by me when I have had enough time coming up with as many reactions to the text as I can."
"Anxious when I’m not doing anything, but too anxious to start because there’s so much to do","I’ve have this problem for sooo long and it’s been holding me back for years. So I want to do a lot of creative things and get good at them. Like drawing, painting, dancing, clay jewelry, flow art, making clothes, custom dolls, music production and djing, and probably more. And I know all these things take time to get the hang of but.. I just don’t practice ANY of them, ever. I’ll wake up and tell myself I’ll practice one of them but get so overwhelmed because in the back of my mind I know there’s so many other things I want to do too. So I just don’t do any of it and waste my time while feeling guilty. It’s like I feel guilty even when I’m “about” to go do it because I know that I won’t get up."
I'm not ok.,"I'm not ok.  I tell my family, friends, and coworkers I am, but I am not ok.  Six months ago my entire future disappeared and what was left in its place was a quivering mess of anxiety, fear, and depression. I get up every day and act like everything is ok, but I'm not ok.

I don't want my teenage son to see how painful relationships can end so I say I'm ok.  I don't want my daughter to worry about me so I smile and say I'm ok.  I don't want my ex to think I'm weak so I say things are good and that I'm ok.  I don't want my family to pity me so I tell them life happens and I'm ok.  

But I'm not ok... and that's ok.

Because I will be ok again one day.  This isn't my first relationship to end.  This isn't the first time I've been here.  This isn't the first time I've felt like this.  I survived all of those, I'll survive this.  As long as I draw breath there's hope.  

And because I have hope, I'll be ok."
I FINALLY did my dishes and I DIDN'T get Anxiety!,"**I just wanted to share this moment with everyone because I am proud.**

 I usually can't do my dishes without getting a small panic attack/anxiety and TODAY I DID NOT get any anxiety and it went really well. I took my time and it is finally DONE after weeks on end of procrastinating. I have my laundry done too, bathroom half clean/kitchen half clean and living room half clean. I am almost done! Here's to hoping I can stay this motivated and it stays clean haha. 

*Thank You For Listening.*"
Do you ever feel like your anxiety isn't bad enough to be valid?,"I'm currently seeing a therapist, who did diagnose me with generalized anxiety (and I struggle a lot particularly with *social* anxiety, as well). However, I constantly feel that my anxiety isn't ""enough"". I don't mean that anxiety is a good thing that we should aspire to have as much of as possible--not at all. It's just that my symptoms and the things that cause me to be anxious coupled with the fact that my anxiety doesn't seem to be as severe as other people's causes me to feel unworthy and unheard. I've never had a panic attack before, and I know several people who with anxiety who have definitely had panic attacks and such. Mine has never gotten to that point. I kind of feel like I'm lost--I'm too anxious to function normally, but seemingly not anxious enough to feel like my anxiety is taken seriously by others. It kind of feels like if people don't see your anxiety physically, if you don't wear it on your sleeve, then you must not be struggling. Has anyone ever felt this way about their anxiety? I feel invalid, like I don't belong sometimes."
Does anyone else get anxious when plans are made or changed at the last minute?,"I'm a planner. I like to have a schedule and stick to it. I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but I get really anxious when the plans change at the last minute. All of these thoughts in my head: ""when will we eat? When will I be able to get ready for work? When will I be able to get some rest? Will I be a terrible person if I turn someone down? I have to go because otherwise I'm not a good friend."" ...and so much more. I wish I could be more flexible. I even have an anti-anxiety backpack with snacks, water, and the essentials and it doesn't help much. Sigh, anxiety."
Does anyone else have this exact problem?,"1. Want to talk to someone about overwhelming anxiety


2. Can't because of overwhelming anxiety

&nbsp;

fml."
Stopping yourself from having thoughts incase someone MAGICALLY reads your mind?,"I do this thing where i will be thinking about certain things , or listening to certain songs with headphones, and I instantly have to change my thought pattern , or change the song i'm listening to, incase someone MAGICALLY can read minds, or hear the song I'm listening to ( normally a guilty pleasure song from my emo phase circa 2006 that I know i'd get mercillesly mocked for)  ... I know it's completely irrational  and I feel super weird posting this, but does this happen to anyone else? Ultimately it just ramps up my anxiety  , but I can't help it. It's been happening to me since I was about 10.... I think it's a childhood fear stemming from primary school ... but there is always this fear of someone finding things out about me and teasing me..."
Does anyone get embarrassed over the littlest things?,"I hate myself. Today was supposed to be a good day. I’m at the opera house waiting to watch a ballet performance. I got all dressed up so I could look classy. But the performance hasn’t even started yet and I feel like my day is already ruined.
When I got here in the morning, I asked a worker where the rooftop resturaunt was. He told me to go straight and then left, but he wasn’t very clear so I accidentally turned in the wrong direction, and a lady held open the door for me and I said “thank you.” Then, the worker said “Miss, that’s the wrong direction” and I was so embarrassed. I said “sorry” to the lady and went on my way. (Mistake 1)
Then, I decided not to eat at the restaurant after all, and decided to eat at Ladureé. When I was at Ladureé I got up to go to the restroom and when I was walking back I slipped on a heel, but luckily I didn’t fall because I held on to the railing. Luckily no one noticed, but I felt so embarrassed. (Mistake 2)
Lastly, when I got to the opera house I went to the coat room and gave my coat to the lady to store. She told me to have a good time at the performance and I told her “you too.” I feel so stupid. (Mistake 3)
I just feel like this day can only get worse and my heart just feels like it’s sinking. I feel like everyone is watching me and judging me. I’m so timid and awkward and scared of what people could me thinking of me. If anyone can give me advice on how to make this stop I would greatly appreciate it. "
I just asked my crush out and she likes me back!,I was so nervous about telling her and I’m still kinda nervous right now lol. Is it normal to still be nervous?
I did a presentation by myself !,"My legs were shaking, my heart was pounding, I stumbled over my words and I felt like I was going to pass out but I did it! 

I stood up in front of my entire class and did my presentation all by myself and I feel so proud of myself !

Edit: Hello everyone!

I would just like to say that I am extremely grateful and appreciative of all the support I have gotten on this post !

I apologies that I haven’t been able to reply to every comment but I genuinely hope that you all grow and overcome your struggles you may have!"
Y’know those sudden times your heart just stops and get that overwhelming sense of dread?,"yea, those suck and it has been happening a lot more recently :(

edit: i don’t think you guys will see this, but thank you so much for all the comments and advice...i’ve read all of them but i can’t really respond to each one 😅 thank you for being such a supportive and loving community"
"Does anyone else have the feeling of being on temporary time? Like, ""Things are just weird right now. I'll have everything together soon.""","It's hard to describe, so I'll just put it in an example.

My hobbies include drawing, writing, and guitar. A while ago, I decided I'd practice one for an hour each day, alternating every day. Not bad, right? A solid, simple plan.

Today, I hardly look at my guitar, and spend a few minutes scribbling on notebook paper before deciding I just don't feel like drawing. I keep telling myself, ""It's just a weird time, what with all my pending homework. Once I get caught up, I'll start practicing."" or, usually, ""Things are just strange right now. Once this time passes, I'll start.""

I feel like I'm just stumbling through days, and have no control. I can't keep a plan because I always use the excuse of ""Things aren't right. Once [x happens], I'll be ready."" Right now, I'm waiting until summer break to start my routine. I know that, once summer comes, I'll just make more excuses.

Does anyone else feel that way? How do you get over the feeling of ""It's not my fault, things just aren't right?"" "
"This is to all the people who are jobless, skipping classes, or completely hopeless in life because of anxiety disorders","My life is far, very far from perfect. But I want to share something.

I graduated high school in 2014. I was a terrible student. I skipped classes like nobody else did. Not because I am “lazy”, but because my anxiety was so high that it totally hindered my ability to stay in class. 

After I graduated, I spent 2015 and 2016 housebound. Agoraphobic,  depressed and fucked up, with no perspective in life. I never imagined I could even enter the room where an university entrance exam would be applied. And I mean it. I couldn’t imagine myself there. I couldn’t even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. 

A miracle happened by the end of 2016. I decided to take an exam, just to TRAIN. To see if I could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. I never expected to pass the exam. I never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent I’m from*. I still don’t believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. I still can’t believe I made it.

I still have problems. Many problems. I am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. However...

I am not hopeless anymore. I can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. I can see myself graduating, I can see myself in a job, and I can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. I feel I can make it.

Please, never, never give up on yourself. Even if you are housebound or jobless, skipping all of your classes, even if nobody else around you believe in you, keep going. You are much stronger than you think you are, I guarantee it. I experienced it. Just put yourself in a situation where you have the possibility of improving and making some kind of progress.

EDIT: I’m so glad this message somehow helped and inspired some people. I wish the best for all of you. You can and *will* dominate anxiety."
I just skipped an entire day of school because I didn't have homework for one class,Why am I like this... I just don't wanna deal with the teacher probably yelling at me and the entire class making fun of me and I can't.. I don't know how to explain it
Fuck company events that make you speak in front of everyone,That is all.
"Anxiety is like the ink splatter in Mario Kart, it tries its hardest to blind me but I will always push through til it fades.",Thank you for coming to my open mic night there's more hors d'oeuvres on the way out.
PASSED MY DRIVING TEST AFTER 7 YEARS,"I am 23 years old, meaning that I have been putting off getting my drivers license for 7 years (since I was 16 obviously). Because I’ve had horrible anxiety with everything in my life, and driving/performing in front of others being at the very top of my fears, I went and took my on the road test today and PASSED. I didn’t have to use any medication or deep breathing, I just knew how amazing it would feel once it was over. I’ve gotten my permit 3 times in the past but let them expire because of my fear of the actual driving test. TRUST ME. If I can do it, you can do it "
Shout-out to my cat for being the best anti-anxiety med there is,"Last night I had a really bad anxiety dream that woke me up so I just grabbed my cat and put him on my chest. There is nothing in this world that will calm me down better than cuddling my cat. Best thing is he seems to enjoy it too 😊

Lately I've been finding time to go home for lunch break during work and I'll just lay down and cuddle or pet him, it's like a reset button on the day. Don't know what I'd do without him!! ♥️"
I need to go to the gym to help with my anxiety but I can’t go to the gym because of my anxiety.,"EDIT: Can I just say all of you are amazing and so incredibly supportive holy hell! You guys have given amazing suggestions and I’m happy to say I was given my correct meds today and will be hitting the gym tomorrow for my first day back! I’m nervous but you guys have been so encouraging I know I can do this. I wish I could hug all of you, and make all of you my gym buddies ♥️"
Does anyone else get overwhelmed with sudden plans and shut down?,"If I get invited to something day-of I’ve been freaking out recently. I’m not really sure if it’s depression or anxiety. But it’s like I really want to go but the possibilities overwhelm me. I have 100% of these times ended up at home alone and crying because I really don’t want to be. I don’t know if I should force myself to go or what. I usually end up frustrating (as far as my itchy mind can tell) my live-in boyfriend because I have to do mental gymnastics about it for a hour or two, make him late, then end up not going.  I don’t think he’s mad or cares but I feel bad about it still, Help? 

Edit: words"
"I temporarily deactivated my Instagram, and it was one of the best things I’ve done for my anxiety/depression (:","I made a similar post regarding why social media can be toxic, etc....

But I finally decided to choose my mental health over some bullshit “Game of Likes” which is Instagram. Gonna take a niiice, long break (might be one month, might be six, who knows...). 

I’m proud of my decision and would highly recommend the same to anyone who has been on the fence. Trust, not having to subconsciously compare yourself daily to “perfect images” of “perfect people” will do wonders if you already struggle with anxiety or have self-image/confidence struggles.

That is all. 🖤

*side note: this song is a whole ass mood for me today since I did away with insta, maybe some of you can appreciate it too 🎧 “Flume - never be like you (Takaryu Redo)” * (:"
I feel actually really good today,I feel great today. I snapped back to reality and pretty much have no anxiety. I know this won’t last forever but I thought I’d share how great I feel. Idk I feel proud of myself!
I haven't had a panic attack in over a month!,"That doesn't mean anxiety doesn't kick in every now and then, but I'm not letting it boil up enough to throw me off my center!!!

Does Anybody Else feel anxious when you are not doing anything?,"Like, if you are working, then you have something to focus on, you didn’t feel anxious, and if you have a long holidays (like a week or so), and you have nothing else to do. You feel anxious for nothing. 

Any tips on this? 

Edit: thanks for all the comments, I’ve read all of them, feel so great that we are not alone here. :) "
I got the job!,"I just got the email from Mcdonalds and i'm so fucking happy! I can finally make my own money, and I plan to move out of my house eventually. After 2 years of depression, anxiety, and self doubt i'm finally moving forward in my life. I can almost cry honestly, I never thought I could beat my anxiety and depression.

Does anyone else have so much they have to do that they just end up doing nothing?,"I'm under a lot of stress right now with going back to school, starting a new job and being a mom of 2 at the same time. I have to hire a sitter for my daughter, which means I have to post an ad and then actually *interview* people. In person. And then tell them if I want to pay them money to watch my kids. 

My house is also just disgusting. Toys everywhere and laundry and dishes and just random shit. It's not like hoarders level and it's respectable enough but it needs a good deep cleaning. 

I have to work by myself for my first time ever tomorrow. Customer service. 

I have to figure out school loans, find a way to buy these ridiculously expensive textbooks, buy supplies for school, clean my car out, go grocery shopping, sell stuff on eBay and donate the rest of it, and try to get 8 hours of sleep because with my anxiety I've been managing about 4 and that's not cutting it anymore. 

I feel like I'm constantly about 30 seconds away from a panic attack. If I think about how much I need to do I can feel myself start to hyperventilate and my chest seizes up and my whole body feels tense and I start clenching my teeth. So the only way I can stop it is to lay down, get out my tablet and play candy crush. I actually did that for two straight hours last night after the kids went to bed without even realizing it. 

Anyway this is rambling and stuff I just needed to get it out. "
Welcome To My Virtual Thanksgiving,"To everyone who is hiding to avoid the people in your house, everyone who is trapped where they are, everyone who is alone, Happy Thanksgiving.

It's okay to hide. It's okay to take care of yourself. You can still be a part of something. You can celebrate the way you want to. You can celebrate here, with me. 

Where we can hide in our rooms and have our episodes and get through this day together.


Come and join me. I'll be here all day!




Edit: It's seven hours later but don't worry. My virtual door is still open. No one is late to my Thanksgiving, we just move at our own pace! You are always welcome here!"
Does anyone get anxious about engaging with their old hobbies? I get so panicked and feel like a failure when I just want to chill and have fun.,"I’ve been trying really hard recently to take up some of my old pastimes again. I used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. Now I get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when I try to get back into them.

 I think its a confidence issue? Like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. I went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. I was considered dumb because I didn’t get A* in everything and I really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. 

Now I feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. They’re meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, I should be good at them and see progress in them. Am I even the person I think I am now that I’m too anxious to do any of these things? 

Another issue is feeling anxious that I’m possibly wasting time. I used to love sitting playing games for hours but now I feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. I feel like I should be doing something more proactive, even if I have nothing else I really need to be doing. 

I’ve started working with polymer clay because its something new and therapeutic and creative. I’ll hopefully see some progress and build up my confidence in myself, instead of feeling like I’ve lost the knack for things I used to enjoy. 

I just feel ridiculous when I take a step back and look at myself. I’m having heart palpitations just trying to relax and do something I used to enjoy. How many of you can relate? I feel like most people stop doing the things they love because of depression/a loss of motivation and interest. "
"After seven years in college, I graduated yesterday!","It took longer than most but I did it! I remembered lurking on this subreddit a few months back and reading someone finishing their degree. I didn't think I'd make it this far, honestly. But that post gave me hope when I just wanted to runaway and hide from everyone.

The past 10 months had some of my worst anxiety moments in my life. So if you are reading this, please believe in yourself! You can do it! And do not be afraid to open up to people who matter. Believe in them believing in you.

Edit:
Hello! I just realized I basically ghosted everyone here. I came back to my hometown and was travelling.

I'm really thankful for the support from everyone in this community. I posted here so I that I may pay it forward - the old post gave me the push I needed when times were dark. Hopefully it can help anyone who is reading this also.

Being an irregular student does take a toll on you. Thoughts about being delayed made me feel embarrassed and ashamed. Oftentimes I felt alone and left out, group projects ended up being a solo thing for me and then I would think I wouldn't be able to finish it. When I enrolled on my last year, I had friends and relatives tell me they were excited that I was finally graduating. That expectation crippled me for a good portion of the year.

It wasn't because my family and friends weren't supportive - they were, they cheered me on. It was I that held me back. And I am glad I overcame my anxiety.

Thank you to this subreddit. It really does help to lift each other up. May we always give each other the boost we need!"
Does anyone else get jealous of people that don’t deal with mental illness?,"*Edit: Let me mention I know everyone deals with their own problems/mental illness. I specifically mean people that may not visibly deal with it like some of us do, or handle it better.

[21F] diagnosed with GAD, Depression, ADD

This is an odd question that has plagued me off and on for a few years..... I am posting here since my anxiety has been my most dominant mental health issue in the last few years. 

Also because I think this is actually a pretty big problem (for me at least). It only breeds more hate in my heart which I don’t need when I’m already juggling so many things. 
A lot of times I find myself so shaken when I see other people, especially people I might’ve gone to high school with for instance, doing so well mentally. They are able to handle so much more (perhaps they take more college classes, work more than me; etc) and still maintain a happy and overall positive attitude. Meanwhile I struggle to get out of bed most mornings and am trying to keep up my motivation enough so I don’t drop out of school again.

I hope this doesn’t come off as a “woe is me” post. I realize what my problems are and also realize I am the only one who can help them. I just want to start an open discussion to see if anyone else feels the same envy and jealously I feel sometimes when I see other people who are doing well in regards to their mental health, despite all the hardships in life.

*also I might add I am very new to Reddit. Please feel free to give me any criticism if anything seems off in my post. I’m still getting used to this platform 🙂"
Does anyone else not go on Reddit after they post something because they're scared of what people will comment?,I do this a lot. Whenever I post something on Reddit I don't go on the site again for a while because I'm too scared to see what people commented on it. I'm super worried about what people will say about my post and I've deleted some of them because I was so apprehensive. I know I shouldn't be worried but I always end up worrying. 
Does anyone else wonder how different their life would be if they didn't grow up with anxiety and depression?,I can't help but think of all the opportunities I have missed or passed on because of my anxiety. I know I would have a much better job. I've been offered promotions but passed them up because thinking of the responsibilities put me into a  panic attack. I've also missed out on so many travel opportunities because of my anxiety. I know I probably shouldn't think about what could have been but sometimes I can't help think about it.
Is anyone else Physically unable to relax the day of something scheduled?,"For example: Let's say I have this appointment next Tuesday, at 4pm. Up until that day, it's not too bad. I know it's not THAT day yet, so I'm able to relax a little bit. ""Oh, I don't have to do that thing for a another few days, thank god"" but then slowly the day of starts rolling around. The Day before I start getting this terrible grumpy attitude and mood, I start feeling depressed, my day is ruined because of this thing the next day.

I start losing sleep, I toss and turn at Night before this scheduled thing thinking and thinking about the worst thing ever happening tomorrow to me, when in actuality it never turns out to be that bad.

Then the Day of this thing rolls around, I wake up in an absolute foul mood, I set off 3 hours earlier than I probably should have just because I can't bear the thought of sitting in the house when I have this thing coming up (I psychically cannot relax, my body won't allow me). I've tried staying at home knowing I have some appointment later in the day, and I honestly feel like I'm trapped in a jail cell.

But then, after all of that, a huge sigh of relief just blows over me. This thing I've been worrying about wasn't even that bad, but the build-up is the real killer, the real anxiety builder and sometimes I honestly feel like I'm losing my sanity. I go from this grumpy, depressed guy to someone absolutely happy beyond belief at least for those few hours after getting something done."
Too tired and anxious to leave my bed. Angry and frustrated at myself for staying in bed. Feeling guilty for not doing anything and wasting time. More anxiety. More paralysis and continue to be stuck in bed. Frustrated I can’t just do the thing. Repeat.,"Edit: UPDATE I was able to leave my bed briefly today, please see my comment below. To everyone else going through the same thing, I hear you friends, keep going.

Edit 2: Someone rightly pointed out that they feel too anxious to read all the comments so I’ll write here how the rest of my day went:

“Thanks for the responses everyone. For those asking, I’m usually fairly good at dealing with this, I’m on medication, I’ve had therapy, I’m knowledgeable about mental health (I’m a social worker), I help my friends and clients through similar things. But despite all of this, sometimes it just gets me you know? I know logically it’ll pass, but it’s so hard, especially when you think ‘I thought I was done with this, not again!’. When you’re in it it’s so hard to think clearly and have perspective. It’s a hole I’ve fallen down many times before and always found my way out eventually, but it’s like each time I think ‘this is the one time I won’t beat it’.

What I did that helped me out of bed today was decide I would do ONE SMALL THING only. Which was to walk 10 mins to the shop to buy oranges. It took me hours to make myself go, but I did, and I felt better for it. I was overwhelmed with all the things I SHOULD be doing and couldn’t start anything, but decided to be kind to myself and say that just doing that small thing was enough. I’m back at home and don’t want to go out again and will probably get into bed again and I still feel awful. But I have oranges now.

From what I’ve read, it’s a positive feedback loop, doing one tiny thing gives you a dopamine boost, which is the motivation neurotransmitter, this then makes you feel more able to do another small thing, and so you build up and eventually hopefully can do more. But all at your own pace, with compassion for yourself when you need to take a break."
Does anyone else's anxiety peak on sundays?,"It's Sunday and every Sunday, I feel more anxious than other days. Woke up with a panicky, nervous feeling this morning and can't shake it off. I worry too much about tomorrow and the next week for no good reason. I can't really enjoy Sundays because of that."
I wish doing normal things was easy.,"Lately I can’t eat, sleep or even leave my house without worrying about every god damn thing. Leave me alone, brain. "
Drove on the highway for the first time in over a year despite extreme driving anxiety!!,"Almost every time I drive I shake really bad, have a really high heart rate, and even sometimes cry. It's hard to ever bring myself to drive even to the local store let alone on the highway. Today I had no choice because I had a dentist appointment in a far city, so I finally drove on a busy highway (and it was raining like mad as well!!) And it actually wasn't that bad. I mean, I'm still not a fan, but it definitely wasn't as terrifying as I thought it'd be. 

I'm happy for this progress because I am an adult and can't keep asking everyone for rides. This also hopefully means I can get a job in a farther city if one becomes available :) Yay!!"
It's going to be okay. Just breathe.,"I have a pattern where for a few weeks I'm fine, Perfect even. And then it goes back into worrying, Stress, And feeling down. I'm on the second one right now unfortunately. But I know I'll be okay. And while I'm down I wanted to hopefully send good energy to anyone else that may need it right now. I don't know you, And I probably never will, But you aren't alone I promise. It will get better, It has to. You're amazing and strong for fighting this. You will prevail."
Sending you all a virtual hug.,"If you’re reading this, I want you to take it easy on yourself; you’re doing the best you can. 

I made a post here recently and got some really nice replies that helped me a lot. I’m feeling a lot better now, so I thought I would send those good vibes back into the universe. :)"
"Does anyone feel anxious about an hour or so before work and then when you begin, your fine?","It’s happening to me right now. I work at target as a seasonal guest advocate and it’s my 4th time working.

Edit: wow time went by fast when I was working at the register. I feel better now lol. I’m on break."
"I'm going to look at my bank account balance and work on a budget tonight. I've been putting it off for months, but no matter how much it scares me, I'm going to do it.","Checking my bank account balance gives me horrible, heart-pounding anxiety. I'm afraid I'll hate myself after seeing how much I've spent, and I also have some residual anxiety from when I was living paycheck-to-paycheck. However, I'm sick of feeling weighed down by money anxiety. The knowledge that I spend money impulsively, don't follow a budget, and don't check my bank account weighs on me \*heavily\*, and I'm ready to shed that weight. Wish me luck.

Edit: I did it! I went through my expenses, cancelled 5 subscriptions (yes, 5), set up a monthly transfer so I can automatically build my savings account, and went through my Mint account to see where I'm spending my money. My goal for January is to cut back on food spending.

Thank you so much for your encouragement! I still have more to do, but I made some great progress tonight. :D"
Is anyone else bothered by the gaps in the bathroom stalls?,It honestly drives me so insane.. there was a line in the bathroom and instead of waiting near the entrance like a normal human being she stands right in front of the stall I’m in and even inches closer to look through. Wtf lady!? 
Are some people on Reddit just...mean?,"I just started being more active on Reddit recently. I posted about something in another sub and have been stupidly watching the up / down votes and wondering why the heck someone would down vote a comment of mine that doesn't need to be down voted. From that perspective, Reddit is definitely the wrong place to be for my anxiety... I know it's not rational but I'm just wondering if this is commonly known.

*Edit:* I did not expect this post to grow as much as it did! Overall - thank you to everyone for your support. I am okay, and I would say my post was moreso an observation and also recognizing that my staring at karma isn't healthy. I'm not taking it *too* seriously but I guess it always boggles my mind when people are assholes. In general. Even though I know it's reality. And yet, there are also truly kind souls, as well."
I tackled my greatest fear and accepted a job!,"I have had 5 jobs in the last 4 years. I quit every single one of them, usually within a week of commencing. The longest I’ve stayed in a job has been 6 weeks. Employment has been my biggest hurdle in my adult life. I become so anxious at work, I start to panic and lose the ability to concentrate. My body goes into fight or flight and I just simply run away and don’t look back. Then the guilt, and depression hits me hard. 

After a good two years of no employment and being on horrible government benefits that constantly threatened to cut and suspended my payments due to not being seen as disabled enough to not work due to my mental health.... I’ve finally had enough. I took my own steps, I went out of my way and I applied for a job in a hospital. 
I got an interview and have been accepted and started just today! 

I have a week of training and then it’s all me looking after a ward. I’ll be doing the afternoon/night shift 3 days a week as an administrator maintaining paper work and discharging/admitting patients. 
My employer is well aware of my hurdles with my mental health and said she is very supportive so fingers crossed I can keep at this and build my confidence up! 
I know i will have my ups and downs, the anxiety will hit me hard some days more than others but I just have to remember how good working is for my mind and how we all start somewhere.

I am proud of myself, It’s so good to be able to say that for the first time in a long time. 

Thank you everyone on this subreddit for being so supportive. 
I hope to read lots of progress stories on here :)"
Reminder of a few important unnoticed characteristics of anxiety you might have missed,"- It urges you to find a solution ASAP, there is an element of hurry and unnecessary haste.

- It urges you to find the perfect solution right away and rejects everything but the perfect solution

- It plays with your memory and conveniently distorts successful events into memories of failure because of catastrophising

- Because anxiety is often accompanied by depression, memory is foggy and because your animal mind realises that your memory is unreliable it adds more and more fear-based shortcuts to prevent you from forgetting the right response to several common daily situations. This obviously makes your life entirely poisoned and anxiety driven.

The software engineering equivalent would be using only exception handling and error handling to handle conditional statements like 'if' and 'switch/case'.

You can come to rely on an elaborate system of pain-trigger-responses (exception handlers) rather than normal behaviour (if/switch) and live in misery and still be highly functioning. This is typically with people who have anxiety for many years or decades.

So if you have a temporary or recurring memory dysfunction (depression, neurological injury, nerve damage, brain injury, migraines, constant headaches), normal visualisation may become difficult and in order to function and not go blank and forget things all the time, you might start using your limbic system to make memory shortcuts instead of your brain. This causes constant anxiety.

- You could use the name  ""fight/flight/freeze response"" or ""exaggerated limbic system response"" instead of the name ""anxiety""

The name ""Anxiety"" makes it sound like it is a mysterious human disorder, whereas it is clearly about the ""stupid"" animal mind inside us, and it pushes the blame correctly on the limbic system, taking away the mystery and ""unknown"" aspect of it, **thus making it much more benign and robbing it of its primary weapon - fearsomeness**"
"I did it, r/Anxiety! I went to the movie theater by myself!","I have been wanting to see The Secret Life of Pets ever since I saw the first trailer, but I couldn't find anybody who wanted to go with me. 

After a week of mustering up the courage to go by myself, I finally drove to the theater tonight. My hands were shaking as I used the touchscreen to buy my ticket from the automated ticket dispenser, but after a deep breath, I managed to click ""confirm"". 

I actually came at a pretty bad time, because the theater was absolutely packed with kids and parents. As a 22 year old male, I stuck out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, the lights were low when I walked in, so nobody even gave me a second glance. 

Get this! Since most of the seats were taken, I had to take a seat at the very front! I was extremely self conscious for the first 5 minutes, as I imagined everyone staring at the weirdo without kids who came by himself. As the first trailers started to play, I calmed down a lot, and from then on, it was easy to relax and enjoy the movie. I even laughed along with the rest of the audience during the movie's funny moments.

I am so proud of myself today. I didn't get any rude or mean comments from anybody, and I saw a movie that I've been wanting to see for awhile. This day was completely awesome :)"
I'm so anxious that my Fitbit thinks I'm excercising.,"Seriously, a panic attack counts as cardio. I want to rage quit life today."
Happy Valentine’s Day. ALL OF YOU ARE LOVED!,"Usually this day makes me super anxious and I avoid all social media because I started to realize I was getting upset over people being happy. I started to wane myself off of Facebook because it made my hands shaky and clammy. I was triggering myself by looking at old flames, exes dating new people, etc. 

I’ve come a long way from last year for sure. 

Make sure to love yourself today! 

Do something nice for yourself and know we are all supportive of each other 💕"
Does posting on Reddit give anyone else anxiety sometimes?,I feel like I have a lot I want to say but sometimes I'm afraid to post anything because I'm worried about criticism or mean comments lol.
I just ordered a pizza.,"By myself. On the phone. Without stuttering (much). For the first time ever.

I feel fucking invincible."
Me: has a panic attack yet again my brain: its DEFINITELY a heart attack this time GO TO THE ER!!!!,why anxiety gotta do me like that
Does anyone else prefer single player games Over online multiplayer games?,"Single player games seem peaceful and relaxing, like everything is going well and you're actually fun. Online multiplayer seems so stressful, frightening, and it really makes you think a lot of negative things.

It feels discouraging that some people I know think it's weird for me to play only single player games.

Edit: I didn't expect this post to get so many responses. It really helps to know that there were so many different answers and seeing different perspectives on this. Thanks :D"
Does anyone else’s anxiety cause abdominal issues?,"After moving a year and a half ago I started having bouts of severe abdominal cramping followed with...lets just say it sped things up. This has happened once or twice a month for 17 months now and I never had prior issues. My doc thinks it’s just irritable bowel (a really common thing especially with anxiety) I’m worried about something like Crohn’s disease with how bad the cramping can get. All my bloods were normal except low B12 implying some level of malabsorption.

Still I’m just curious if anyone with anxiety like me has had GI upset from it often, I never had issues before but obviously moving was quite a jump and stressful time.

EDIT: I was tested for Celiac, since my father had it they actually checked for the gene and I do not carry it. So that’s ruled out 99.9%"
I just unfollowed my ex on all social media,"Checking social media the past couple months has caused me so so much anxiety, I was constantly afraid to see his face pop up on my screen, because I guess it was my last tie to him. Last night I finally unfollowed him! I’m proud of myself but still sort of sad


Edit: THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!! The supportive comments have really brought peace of mind to me and honestly after the initial anxiety, I feel a sense a freedom"
Does anyone else fear that people you interact with might think you're insane because of how weird anxiety makes you act?,"Sometimes I'm totally fine and can hangout with complete strangers and have a great time and all is well but other times (probably the majority of the time) I'm a nervous wreck and my voice cracks or gets way lower than usual and I mumble and can't look people in the eyes and (apparently, from what I've been told) have a super pissed off look on my face for no reason when I'm interacting with people I don't know and I'm starting to get scared that a lot of people think I'm some kind of psycho from how weird I may seem when my anxiety's flaring up.

I also start over analyzing the way I walk so I walk super weird and sometimes have intrusive thoughts of super embarrassing moments that make me visibly cringe.... Jesus, even as I'm typing this I'm realizing I probably look even worse than I thought.... Anyone else fear that those around them think they're some kind of psycho when they're actually just super nervous for no reason?"
"My wedding is tomorrow, I’m gonna make it","I never believed I would make it. I thought i’d have a heart attack from panicking too much sometimes. I’m trying to not panic now. She is so beautiful. She’s the one that can calm me completely. 

Life gets better. Never give up"
I just need to say it.,"Even though it might not look like much, I promise I am trying my absolute hardest. "
It's ok to be nervous. It's ok to be scared. It's ok to cry.,"I don't know who needs to hear this, but this is recent advice that has helped me a bit with my anxiety. 

I was reminded of this before a recent first date. I was pacing back and forth, getting more and more nervous. My roommate said ""it's a first date, of course you're nervous"". I stopped pacing. Wait, that actually makes sense, it's completely normal to be nervous before a first date. In fact, I would say not being nervous is actually weird. I'm being normal and I need to stop reacting to my anxiety like it's not normal. I need to stop fighting it.

It's very easy to get stuck in the mindset of ""If I'm not completely comfortable, then that is bad."" - but it's important to remember that there is a lot of distance between comfort and uncontrollable anxiety. A lot of the people here have been on the extreme end of anxiety, it SUCKS, and it's something we'll have to continue to battle. But we should also realize that the early stages of anxiety are sometimes very normal, felt by most people. If we begin to think it's not normal, then that just helps it feed it, it spirals, it grows, and then it does become abnormal.

Anyways, random perspective that may help someone."

"If someone tells me to ""just calm down"" one more time I swear to god .","Anyone else have this problem people just say ""just calm down""  or "" I have anxiety too it's not that hard ""    like bitch if you had anxiety you would know you dont just ""calm down"" .  

I'm cross posting this to the other anxiety sub too   "
Remember: You are strong.,"I know there are times, especially on bad days, where you can feel so weak and helpless. So pathetic for not being able to beat back your anxiety, so useless for letting it win over you. Always remember that that's not true. That's a lie the disorder is telling you, it's actually the opposite of true.

You are so strong. You shoulder so much more every day than you should ever have to, and you still go on. You are always fighting. You've lived this long without giving up. You are brave for going about your day when all you want to do is crumple to the ground. You are a warrior for smiling when you want to cry. You are a champion for getting up when you just want to stay in bed all day.

I know some people might be tired of hearing things like this, but I also know there has to be at least one person who needed this reminder today. I know I needed to remind myself. You deserve a medal for the fight you're fighting. You are not weak. You are not pathetic. You are brave. You are strong."
Does anyone else miss their old selves? Before anxiety and depression messed you up?,"Because i do. I miss those days when i used to smile a lot, laughed a lot, and talk a lot. I keep avoiding my past friends now because i'm such a mess. 

As i was studying at school, all i can do now is to watch my old friends grow up with me at the background. They just grow up so fast. "

>People suffering from anxiety disorders and Tourette's syndrome will soon be able to legally obtain medical marijuana in Pennsylvania.

>State Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine announced on Thursday that anxiety disorders and Tourette's will be added to the list of “serious medical conditions” that are included in the state’s medical marijuana program next week.

>Levine said the new inclusion was based on a recommendations from the Medical Marijuana Advisory Board, as well as research on marijuana treatment with both conditions.

"Anyone else having to remind themselves that anxiety can manifest itself physically, especially during times of stress?","It’s happened to me a million times before, but this is obviously a unique time. I’ve convinced myself before that things were wrong physically, to the point of having tests done all with negative results. After I control my anxiety, the physical symptoms fade. 

Aside from many aches and pains, I’m almost positive I have Costochondritis, which apparently isn’t dangerous and emotional stress can cause it. Of course 🤦🏻‍♀️. Basically my chest hurts in a certain spot. 

Even though I’ve been through similar things before, everything going on is definitely not helping. Although I don’t think I need one, I’m also constantly thinking about how I don’t want to have to go to the doctor and be exposed in that environment. Ugh. How are you guys?"

Currently experiencing my anxiety nightmare. Reported sexual harassment at work and have a meeting with HR and the CEO in an hour. Willing myself not to puke.,"Long story, but over a couple months, one of my bosses had been sexually harassing me. I kept trying to brush it off, but I didn't know how to stop it and it was making me extremely uncomfortable being around him. I had worked for this person for two years without incident, and he knows about my anxiety, need to please others, and my conflict avoidance. Literally one of my weaknesses in my performance evaluation is ""trouble saying no to people"". I am also half his age and he is many levels above me in the company. I was the perfect target. I finally confided in my supervisor, who gave me the courage to step forward. 
I wrote out a log of days and times and what occured, which was a good idea timeline-wise, but also kept me from having to repeat out loud what was said and done to me when I went to HR. HR was very professional and took it seriously, telling me it wasn't my fault and they were glad I came forward.
My harasser is on unpaid suspension while they conduct an investigation, interviewing others in his department to see if anyone else has observed anything else. 

I have a meeting with HR, the CEO, and the VP in an hour and I can't stop panicking. I don't know what they will ask me. And I am completely mortified that they all know what I let happen. I also feel intense guilt for ruining his career. He was the face to many of our projects, and I'm throwing such a wrench into it. I really trusted him, so when this all started, I had no idea what to do. 

I've been crying for days. Sweating constantly. I just want this over with and this has been the longest day of my life. I can't focus on work AT ALL and just want to go home and hide."

When I was a kid, I did not have any of the anxiety disorders I have now. I felt like pretty much everyone else (normies). Anxiety never stopped me from doing anything. If I wanted to do something, I'd get it done. 

Interacting with other human beings felt more organic and easy. There was no anxiety involved. I didn't even try........it just happened (I'd imagine that's how its supposed to be). Everything was so easy.

Now as an adult, I am a mess of anxiety disorders. It hampers my life in so many ways. The anxiety came during my teenage years. I can't understand why it just suddenly came out of nowhere.............anxiety being such a serious problem that it is....you'd think it should start right from the minute you were born. But its not. It came at a certain point. And that's how anxiety works for most people. It comes during their teenage years. Not in childhood.

If we were that way in childhood, why can't we reach that state again? Is it possible?

I feel like we've all just been corrupted in some way. And I don't mean corrupted in a bad way. I mean corrupted like a hard drive. When hard drives gets fragmented, they don't function like they used to. Normies are simply people who haven't undergone any fragmentation. So that's why they maintain the same temparement they had since they were kids. 

That's why they don't understand what social anxiety is. Because socializing is inherently a pleasurable act..........but anxiety can insert itself into that natural process and '' fragment '' it. 

It's not even like I'm asking for anything unrealistic or out of my reach (like becoming a millionaire or something). What I want is something that I've already experienced! I know what it feels like."
"Shout out to all the significant others out there who love us, and listen to us - even when we ramble the same thing over and over and over again.","I had HORRIBLE anxiety last night - which later led into a panic attack in bed ^(yay!)

My fiance just kept reassuring me and listening. Holding me close. He kept patient with me even during his horrible migraine. It got to that point where I was annoyed with myself but couldn't turn it off. He was still there. Listening. Never upset. He just wanted to make sure I was okay and calming down.

Thank you to all of y'all out there doing this for us. This shit is hard. Mentally draining. It's such a relief to be able to get this shit out verbally and not be yelled at or told to ""hush up.""

Y'all the real MVPs.

Edit: I should have also put family/friends etc. Not just significant others!!!   
But dang - thank yall so much for these wonderful replies. SO happy to see all the love!"
It’s my birthday! I confidently talked with many people today despite my social anxiety! Hooray!,"Edit: WOAH! You guys are seriously incredible and SO KIND! Thank you for all the love and messages! Today was progress, tomorrow will be more. "
After 5 years of anxiety depression and daily panic attacks I’ve decided enough is enough!,"I’m currently on my way to a new start, a new job fuck this anxiety it will be here regardless so I might aswell go and live my life as I want to! No longer will I let it control every aspect of my life, and for the first time in about 7 years I have just got a solid 8 hour unbroken sleep, just thought I would share this with you guys, take care everyone."
My anxiety comes in waves of good weeks and bad weeks. I keep a diary and on a good week I wrote out a list of bullet points for me to read when I'm having a bad week,"This is just something I wrote for myself and I was just wondering if it might help any of you even a bit, idk... It's not anything official so please don't get really angry at me if I have made a mistake.

-	Panic attacks / anxiety means cortisol levels are high
-	It's next to impossible to think happy thoughts when there’s cortisol everywhere
-	It's just the chemical making you feel this way, this is not you
-	If you start feeling anxious, just try to lower the cortisol levels; breath, ground yourself, feet on the floor, mindfulness
-	These are just thoughts, they aren’t as bad as they seem – it doesn’t seem true right now but you must believe it
-	Be aware and let them happen, don’t fight it
-	You can get through this, you have before
-	Just ride it out
-	Resist the temptation to let the anxiety take over – you do not want to feel this way
-	If you just want an excuse to relax/procrastinate you can do that without anxiety
-	If you refuse to believe that when you’re happy you’re not just faking it, then at least accept that it's nicer like that anyway as you dont have frequent panic attacks
-	Fuck the cortisol
-	Fuck anxiety
-	This won’t last forever

Edit: thank you for all the lovely comments"
#metoo,"I am having a very hard time this week with my anxiety because I feel inundated by the news related to Kavanaugh/Ford allegations. 

In May of 1986, I, too, was gang raped at a high school party by boys that I knew, while I was intoxicated.  I am not going to share the details of the attack,  I am willing to say that I was hospitalized afterwards with significant injuries and I was unable to attend  my high school graduation because I was in the hospital.  Although I am pretty sure that my parents knew my injuries weren’t from “falling down in the woods” and the medical practitioners that examined me were very much aware that I didn’t just fall down.. no one addressed the true nature or extent of it.. even me.

I never talked about it. I never wanted to. I never wanted “justice.”  I wanted to make it go away because for a long, long time I felt like it was my fault. 

After 32 years.. it’s right there.. all over again.

I want to scream at every Facebook poster that has something obnoxious to say about Ford not coming forward.  I want to punch everyone who says “well, she was drunk” or “Boys will be boys.”  I want to vomit every time someone says “why did she wait so long?” and worse.. “he didn’t do anything..he just didn’t help her.” 

I feel like this happened to me last week, not over 30 years ago.  It doesn’t seem fair after successfully tucking it away for so long  it has resurfaced. 

I can see their faces in my dreams again. Even the ones who laughed at my torn bloody clothing and didn’t to anything to help, 

Edit: I adore all of you!! I focused on all of your support and wonderful well wishes.. not on the news!! Thank you, thank you, thank you! "
I felt apart in front of her,"We had such a great time in bed, just hanging around laughing and watching a movie. In one moment I just felt apart for no reason, I crashed, I felt so broken and started crying while hugging. I asked her if she could just hold me tight, as tight as she can and she did that. She said I love you.

&#x200B;

For the first time in my life I felt safe while having a breakdown, all I did earlier was just getting shit for being such a crybaby. 

&#x200B;

I've never felt that much support and we've been together only for about 3 weeks, but when I'm with her I feel safe mentally, I feel like pieces of me are coming back together.

&#x200B;

Thank u for listening"
Calling in sick gives me massive amounts of anxiety,"I started a new job at the beginning of May, and everything has been going well I think. Last night I started feeling bad (i.e. swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, weak body with chills and hot flashes). I went to bed early and took some medicine and Vitamin C, dreading the morning and the fact that I may possibly have to call out. 

Well, I woke up about 45 minutes ago and still felt horrible. But I still got up, showered, shaved, and got dressed, until I finally told myself “wow I can’t do this.” I stared at boss’s phone number on my phone for a good 5 minutes before I worked up the courage to finally call him. He seemed like it was fine and told me to get better,  but my anxiety is still eating at me. 

DAE get anxiety from calling in sick? Especially since I’m new at my position, I feel like I am slacking off and my boss maybe thinks I’m lying. I also get paid hourly, so the 8 hours of work I’m missing is going to mess up my budget for the month

:-("
I finally made a doctors appointment on my own!,"I have general anxiety and social and really hate making phone calls as most people with anxiety do but today I finally made a appointment on my own .My husband usually calls stuff for me but I'm tired of letting this control me. I've been having some health issues and keep putting off going but I know I need to go.I was so nervous to call at first but then I realized theres no reason its not like she was judging me and even if she is who cares.I was so proud of myself all day for something normal adults do all the time lol. My appointment isn't for 3 weeks which sucks and now I'm a little nervous for that but I know I can get through it. We always make things out to be worst than they end up being, its so weird.

Wow I didn't expect so much positive comments! Thanks guys so much.This really made my day. "
Saw someone else post this recently but I got a job ☺️ I’m so happy. I just listened to everything my gf said and slowly figured everything out. She is a blessing. You can do it!!!!!!,"All I did was make a profile on the indeed app(yea I sound like a shill but fr) and applied to 7 jobs in seconds this morning. This afternoon got a call from one of them and went in for an interview.  I decided to just be myself and not worry about the interview, to treat them like a friend. They have something to gain from me and I have something to gain from them? Thats how I went into it and it worked ☺️ I’m so proud.  Omg.  Sorry.  I know I’m not special. But I had such a massive panic attack last night I thought I would never pull out of it. Today is so different ☺️

I have a job interview for a promotion today!,"Send good vibes my way please! ☺️😊😁

Update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! I walked in feeling super confident, but.... 

I did not get the job. It turns out that I was vastly unprepared for the interview and I had no idea. The interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. 

Looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed I figured I already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. I had asked a senior employee who has had the position I was interviewing for what I needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. I know he didn’t do it maliciously, he’s a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. 

Lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. The interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time I apply for a promotion. 

I was terrified that  I would make a catastrophic mistake during my interview and I did. While being so worried about my future with the company and being black listed if I messed up I had forgotten that the interviewers and managers are good and honest people who want to help their employees grow and succeed. Even if we do fail, sometimes there’s a hand ready to help us back up. "
Sending y’all hugs as you prepare for the week.,"I don’t know what you’re going through in your life, but we will get through it together. Remember to drink water and try to take some comfort in some of the things around us.  
  
I had a yummy breakfast today and have been hugging the heck out of my pets. It’s been tough lately, but we’ve got this! ❤️"
Last night I went to a club alone (and loved it). A few years ago I could barely leave the house.,"Saw online that an artist I listen to was gonna be DJing at a club near me. The music is quite underground (techno/lofi house) and none of my friends are really into it. On a whim I thought 'fuck it' and bought a ticket.

Went to it last night. Music was blaring, place was busy af. There are I am, dancing and just feeling the music, not caring about what anybody thinks. While I was there it dawned on me that a few years ago I could barely leave the house without being ridden with anxiety/panic.

I hope this post gives some people hope :)

Also I'm just really happy to be where I am today, looking back on how I used to be."
Does anyone else get random lapses of “contentment” where your mind is at peace before the anxiety comes back?,Edit: Wow. Thank you all for the replies and letting me know I’m not alone. You are all very brave every day. 
"For the first time ever, I ran with my SHIRT OFF!","I'm not even lean, plus I'm as pale as a vampire. Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!"
I wrote a bit of a poem about self-doubt. My therapist advised that I share it.,"I'm scared! I shout, to no one

I'm hurting but what if it isn't real? 

There is a duality to the doubt I feel, 

Outward initially, then turned inside - 

Did this even happen? Do I see this right?
 
Can I trust my mind?

Is my memory real or is it defined

by my own narrative?

Of course it is.

Then how do I believe it? How do I know it's true?

If this is just in my head then what do I do?

Am I everything I hate, defined? 

As bad as those I strike down in my mind? 

The jury is out and it seems almost unanimous, 

But what if the crime was committed by one of us? 

The judge is scornful and asks with derision, 

Are you even capable to make this decision?

After all, you wrote your own dialogue. 

Internal monologue, set thrusters to overdrive. 

Constantly in fight or flight, zoom in, analyse. 

Please give me some peace. 

Peace comes to the dead.

I don't want to be die,

But perhaps it might be nice 

To have a rest.

Why can I see so many things?

Not a hallucination, that's not what this is.

It's a sight I can't see with my eyes.

The connections, the links, the things that make my heart stop.

They're not visual but they exist.

They exist in my mind, and my mind alone.

I state them aloud and in pours the doubt. 

I made this.

I have created something, what is it?

Oh, it's anxiety. Hello. 

Sit with me a while. 

Am I propogating my own downfall?

This person is hurting me, let me tell you.

This is all the things that they do;

It doesn't sound bad enough. 

It sounds petty, pathetic, petulent and pitiful, 

Not like it should cause the pain that I go through. 

Yes, I'm being negatively affected by external factors,

But I'm the one processing them.

Am I doing this right?

Is this okay?

Am I validated for feeling this way?

Did I put myself in the wrong situations,

Or have I convinced myself they're bad?

Would things be fine if I saw this differently?

Paint on a smile, adopt positivity, 

Or is that accepting less than I deserve?

What do I deserve anyway?

Decency. Respect. Honesty.

Love, maybe.

But why? 

Do I give these to others?

Can I?

The main point of contention -

Is everything I know just an invention?

We're judged on our action and not our intention.

I'll never see how another sees me, 

So how will I ever truly rest easy. 

Would people be honest? Am I?

You get back what you put into the world.

Did I put this out? Is this projection?

Is this a narrative for my own protection?

I don't feel very safe.

Have I made myself a victim?

Or did other people harm me?

Did they shatter the glass, or did I?

Pandora had hope in her box of demons.

I wonder if doubt always sat on it's shoulder, 

Nesting, infecting, and spilling all over? 

Will things get better, is this just situational?

Are they too broken or too confrontational? 

Or maybe, just maybe, it's me.

I'm always the common denominator, see. 

Am I putting myself in punishing places?

Seeing the lies behind smiling faces? 

Or have I just framed it that way? 

Everything bad happens to me.

Does it really?

I'm resilient. I get through.

Look at everything I've had to do.

I'll tell you, but it's from my point of view.

So how do we know even know if its true?

What would you say? And would I believe you? 

Where do I go when I can't accept my own truth, but can't accept another either?

I view everything I perceive through a fear being
deceived. 

Can any of us be believed? 

I don't trust because I don't want to be wrong.

But then I can't trust myself. 

What if I'm the one with the big bag of tricks?

Pull the wool over my own eyes.

Fill my mind with my own-brand lies.

Is there respite? 

Is there relief? 

Whats the cure? 

Is it self belief? 

How do I believe what I know can't be fact? 

How is everyone else maintaining that act? 

Am I alone?

I feel alone, I whisper, to no one.

"Deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. No one has even noticed!","Last Saturday morning, I deactivated fb (with a view to letting it delete after however long it takes). I found that despite 400+ 'friends', I actually wasn't enjoying it at all anymore. I know it's a cliché, and not real at all, but seeing people live their seemingly perfect lives, going out together, watching the little cliques develop and feeling increasingly left out, I decided enough was enough. It's not helping my mental health in the slightest. It has to go.

It is, admittedly, somewhat cathartic and liberating to no longer be a part of that social media network. I still have the ability to use messenger, so can still talk to people. But I think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed I'm no longer active on there. Which I suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.

I feel very lonely. Friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if I message them, it just gets left on 'read'. There are only so many times I can try, before I stop because clearly they won't respond.

There were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. About how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. The irony is, no one has. And despite not wanting to believe it, I don't think anyone will.

I work, I go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. I'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.

I've posted on here once or twice, yo other subreddits, but never to this depth of revealing my feelings. I honestly don't mind if no one resounds, it's just useful for me to get this out of me.

I hate feeling sorry for myself, and I hate burdening people, even strangers - so anyone that reads this! with my ridiculous insignificant problems.

I'm just so very lonely. I'm sorry. "
What people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.,"When I am feeling anxious and am searching the internet for advice I often come across some form of this:

""Understand that your anxiety is illogical and that you aren't actually in danger""

Suggesting that if you realize this, the anxiety will go away. In my experience it is the exact opposite. Just feeling anxious is one thing. I've felt anxious before big events, it's not pleasant, but if I don't fight it, it comes and goes and I move on. But feeling anxious and knowing you shouldn't be is where the problems really start. When I am anxious and know I shouldn't be, I worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. I can stay like this for weeks or months and I only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and I get distracted enough to stop rejecting how I am feeling.

In the last year I have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. This is way harder than it sounds. It's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. When I start feeling anxious, I make the conscious effort to accept how I'm feeling. I can't pull it off all the time, but I'm getting better and better at it. The trick is that you have to really believe it. You have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. You can't trick yourself and ""accept"" your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. You have to really be OK with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. It will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.

Edit: Talking with several other anxiety sufferers, I'm finding that this advice is more applicable to people who experience chronic low-level anxiety and less applicable to people who experience acute panic attacks."
"I got drunk for the first time in over 6 years this weekend. My anxiety is now so bad, that I am considering suicide.","I haven't drank in many years. This weekend I got drunk. I don't know why I allowed myself to drink, I guess I am not as strong as I thought, and now my anxiety is out of control. It has been almost two days since I drank, but my anxiety is still so bad that I feel that I would rather die than experience one more day feeling this badly. 

I have attempted suicide twice in the past, the last time being 5 years ago. I really don't want to die, but can no longer live with near constant and debilitating anxiety. 

Has anyone ever experienced these feelings after using alcohol? Thanks for reading.

Edit: I don't think it is right to downvote posts about suicide. Can someone please tell me what I said in my post that was wrong? I am really sorry if I should not post here."
DAE ever feel like you are rushing through the day to get home to do nothing?,"I feel like from the moment I wake up until I get home I am rushing through the day and my tasks. It ends up causing me to have more anxiety because I become forgetfull or I half-ass my work duties and end up regretting it. I know if I take a deep breath and just slow down things are much more stress free, but I really want to get to the point where that is my normal. I have a job, i'm done with college, what am I rushing for...? end rant."
I looked after myself today,"I got up and had a shower and shaved and brushed my teeth. I've been doing everything I need to do for my children and around the house, but I've been neglecting myself. I also did my makeup and hair for work. I'm pretty proud of myself"
I just talked myself down from an anxiety attack!,"(Context:My therapist and I have been working on getting to the root of my anxiety, and a lot of it comes from feeling like my needs are less valid than others, and villainizing myself for putting my needs first ever. )

My boyfriends mom wanted to come over and help with yard work today, and it being my only day off for the next four days, didn’t really want to spend most of the day interacting with people and doing yard work. 

I started to go into a panic attack about it, then stopped myself and reminded myself that it’s ok to put my needs first. Talked to myself gently instead of harshly and it really made a difference. 

Still a bit anxious, but I have a game plan for the day and am planning on helping out with the basic yard work then excusing myself to have some alone time with my art or a video game. 

Progress is good."

Probably the most exhausting part about anxiety is that the simple tasks are twice as difficult to do when compared to what I imagine non-anxious people deal with.,"Gotta get ready for the day? What is the step by step breakdown of every task I need to do before I’m presentable...

Got a list of things due at work? What’s most important, did I order that correctly, alright I’m done...is my work good enough...

Has anyone here ever screamed/felt like screaming from how anxious and overwhelmed you feel? I need someone to understand,"Hi...I'm writing this while I have a small panic attack. Okay so one of my biggest fears is that I'm gonna feel so anxious and overwhelmed that I'm just gonna start screaming. I get scared I'm gonna do it in public or around people that don't understand my situation. And I haven't done it so far. I've always had anxiety but it got worse in the summer of 2019. I know that if I were to scream, I would have to stop eventually and it calms me a little bit but then I get another panic attack and the fear comes back. I feel really lost and like I'm actually going crazy (I know that's just anxiety talking haha).

does anyone else wake up with a sense of impending doom upon you?,"it seems like every time i wake up in the morning i momentarily feel like i’m dying or spiraling out of control. i have almost a mini panic attack every time i wake up and then i have to ground myself and remind myself that i’m just waking up and everything is okay - does this happen to anyone else? it’s been very hard to deal with and almost makes me not want to go to bed at night because i know this will happen in the morning when i wake up.

My therapist of 4 years just passed away... I want to celebrate him. He helped me through my worst years.,"This isn't a post about being anxious due to my clinical psychologist dying. It is a celebration of what he meant to me and a celebration of all the therapist out there that are making a difference. 

My therapist's name was Louis. When I met him, nearly 4 years ago, I was at a bad place in my life. I had been suffering from the effects of Anxiety Disorder for nearly 13 years, and visiting my GP monthly for over a year, when I asked her for a recommendation for a therapist. She gave me Louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.

After delaying for weeks, I called all of the referrals I was given. Two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was Louis. What are the chances that I would like the only Therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)

I was really nervous about meeting Louis because I had never been to therapy before. I had no idea what to expect. Would he judge me? Would he yell at me? Would he humiliate me? Would he intimidate me into taking action? I wasn't sure, but decided that I was willing to try.

Louis was a short Jewish man that reminded me of the actor Saul Rubinek (Warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. He had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. After meeting him once, I knew that we were going to get along. Sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. This is how it was with Louis and me. :)

As I went to each session, I discovered that Louis and I had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. So his recommendations felt tailored to me. In a way, talking to Louis was like talking to an older version of myself. We had different upbringings, I was raised Catholic and he was raised Jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. This was the reinforcement I needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. I was in good hands.

Don't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. But every session was productive. He knew how to see past my BS. He knew how to get to the core of the issue. And the amazing thing was that the days that I thought I had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.

Basically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your BS. This means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. 

Now, after 4 years of treatment. I am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to Louis. My goal when I started therapy was as follows:

To be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. 

Louis helped me to do these things by supporting the work I did as a vlogger. He helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. He helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.

Now...

Today, while on a hike, I found out that Louis had passed away via the internet. I hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. His message had been replaced with a referral service. I instantly typed ""Obituary Louis..."" and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and I had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. 

The feelings came rushing in, but there was no Anxiety. It was just a combination of sadness and joy. As I walked through the park, I cried and laughed - I must have looked like a crazy person. 

I cried because I lost a great friend. I laughed because I was full of joyful gratitude. He saved my life. And, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.

I decided that, while I missed his funeral, that I would place flowers at his office door. His office was right next door to a supermarket; so I ran in and got some flowers and a card. I quickly returned to my car and added the line... ""Louis was a blessing in my life.""

I exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, ""You can't park here..."". I turn with flowers in hand, ""My friend is dead, I just want to show him some respect."" 

We argued a little and I told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, ""Fine! I will move my car!"" I could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but I just didn't have the time or energy.

I ran up the stairs to Louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. All I could think of is that Louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. 

I drove toward the attendant... He looked me in the eye as I approached. Probably thinking I was going to flip him off or something. But I channelled my friend and said, ""I want to apologize. I was a jerk to you. My friend died and I am a little upset. But he trained me to see when I am spreading my pain around. You were just doing your job."" 

The attendant told me, ""I am feeling really bad about this..."" I told him ""I am sorry for making you feel bad, but I am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. 

Louis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.

Thank you Louis. 
I love you! 
godspeed my brother."
People wished me a happy birthday this year!,"# Last year, I made a post here,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8ltlf/can\_someone\_wish\_me\_a\_happy\_birthday/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/b8ltlf/can_someone_wish_me_a_happy_birthday/) because nobody wished me a happy birthday last year.

This year, I'm happy to say that I've grown out of my comfort zone and I've made some friends in school, and they've wished me a happy birthday! It's been the best birthday i've had in a long time, and i feel I've came a long way in terms of my anxiety and in terms of my social skills since i made that post, and I really appreciate those of you who sent a message this year wishing me a happy birthday, it's much appreciated! Thank you all so much!"
Unsubscribing because I need real help and this sub isn’t really supportive,"Sure some special people get advice and then get upvoted due to crowd upvoting. I’ve posted multiple times and I feel stupid and like I’m screaming into a void. I’d go into what’s wrong but what’s the point. 

Thanks and hope other people have better luck.... they usually do."
Looking back at my life I realized that I had stopped living life. I was literally just trying to get to the next day.,"Just living in the thought of tomorrow. It was like I was not living. Just waiting.

And the trouble was that, I didn't know what I was waiting for, I was kind of scared for what it might be.

"Why do I get ""text back"" anxiety?","Rationally, I KNOW that people are busy living their lives. But WHY do I get the horrible anxious feeling whenever my boyfriend goes a whole day without calling or texting me?

He is a busy man, and I know that he gets tired after a long work day. I'm not a naggy girlfriend either, but my dumb brain goes into overdrive always thinking about silly scenarios of why he's not answering me.

""He doesn't like you anymore""
""You're not important enough""
""He forgot about you again today, maybe another girl is distracting him""

In reality, he probably just fell asleep.
""But he always says goodnight first"" ...urgh!!

Please tell me I'm not the only one! Help!

EDIT: Thank you ALL who have responded. It truly means a lot to me to know that I'm not totally insane or alone! I agree that there are many factors involved, it's not 100% me. Although I feel like I need some distraction strategies to help me with the overthinking :/"
posting on Reddit gives me anxiety - so this is me fighting that anxiety,"I have been a lurker on Reddit, and many other sites on the internet for many years now. It took me years until I could even bring myself to make a Reddit account (and other accounts.) However, I could not bring myself to post anything or any comments no matter how badly I wanted to. In the past, I have posted a few things when I had been feeling brave enough to overcome my anxiety, but I always go back into hiding.

The internet, and Reddit, is supposed to offer a free medium for people to freely express and share their ideas, creations, thoughts, and opinions. Despite amazing, silly, and positive things happening on Reddit everyday, on social media there is social pressure. People wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) Trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.
Before I even wrote this I researched and found several older /r/Anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how I felt.

Even though I tell myself that I don't care about validation from others, that I don't care about what others think or being judged, I still get anxiety. In the back of my mind, I still have fear that whatever I have to say or do is not worth expressing. That someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. That all of my thoughts are invalid. And because of that I shouldn't even try. Better nothing than a negative outcome.

On top of subconsciously fearing others, I fear myself. That whatever I have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. That my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.
All throughout my school life, I have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. It was either 100% or 0%. Which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  This post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.

But at the moment, I am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. Something, anything, is better than nothing. This post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how I write it, just the fact that I did it. That it doesn't matter if what I write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. And that my thoughts are valid because they exist. 
As long as am I alive, I am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. Reddit is just one small way of doing so.

I got my first 'real' job and survived my first day--8 hours--without letting my panic take control.,"Yesterday was a giant victory for me. I recently got a job at a pet store I had wanted so badly and got through my first day without having a panic attack. I'd been putting off getting a better job to replace the 'job' I had before--working 2-8 hours a week at my mom's store for about 3 years now. I can actually start saving money and hopefully move forward with my life once I have some savings. I work again today but only for 4 1/2 hours.

For the first time in years I feel like I'm making true progress past my anxiety and depression and it feels empowering. Just wanted to share c:"
Valentine’s Day should also be a reminder of SELF-LOVE,It is usually a day during which we show love to someone else. But we need to also see it as a reminder to consistently show love to our own selves. Seeking help and focusing more on our victories (less on our shortcomings) are good starts. Your identity is not defined by your anxiety. You are MORE than that! Anxiety is not your final destination. So let’s stop beating ourselves up for yesterday! Love yourself more than you hate your circumstances ❤️
I hate calling people,"Especially when it's people who call asking for information (doctor, insurance, etc.)

I made a small accomplishment today! I managed to go to the gym alone.,"After months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, I decided that I needed to challenge myself and do something that I haven’t done before. 

Usually I go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise I feel overwhelmed. 

I had gotten kinda out of shape as I haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. 

Honestly, I’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way I look so I really wanted to change that before it gets worse. For me, working out is one of the few things that I actually enjoy doing! A bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. 

I kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if I get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? No one really cares about what others do in the gym. 

With this in mind, I managed a great workout session and I plan to keep it up. I feel amazing! 

Taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take.  I hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️

After 6 months of struggling to get a job I’ve finally done it!!,"I have been trying for 6 months to battle back anxiety and apply for jobs and not shut the world out completely. It’s been super rough and my mental health and self worth took a lot of battering from all the times I was rejected or ignored.

But today, today I get a win. I got a job with a lovely stationary and gift shop and I love it there, the boss and coworkers are so kind and forgiving and helpful in my training, the customers have been polite and I’m genuinely enjoying being out and around people.

It feels so good to have this breakthrough and despite there being a lot more I have to work on to be better, I got a win. I’ve gone from not being able to leave my room, and cringing at any stimulus, to being here now. 

I wanted to share the love and hope, know it may take awhile but the perfect opportunity is coming, trust guys! Hope you guys get a win soon even something small, getting out of bed and doing anything that makes you happy is a win to me. I love you all, hope this can brighten your days. :)"
"Friendly reminder to anyone in the the US (yes this includes cali and florida, you're not exempt): if you have anxiety or depression, this is the time to get tested for low vitamin d and possibly start supplements.

And its recommend to take up to 5000iu of D3. NOT D2.

They threw a softball technical question at me and I just cracked. It was like I couldn't think at all. I choked at looked at their stares of disappointment. I just said ""ya know what? I'm done"" and asked to be escorted out of the building. Not a fun time. Luckily I'm already employed but I never want something like this to happen ever again. Anxiety is a bitch."

I utterly hate it when someone tells me that I am wrong. Not because I want to be right but because it makes me feel that I am an idiot or inadequate,"I assume that everyone else wants to be right about something and I assume that everyone feels sad when they find out that they are wrong and my judgement tells me that the average person manages to accept it and get it over.

But good Lord, when I come to the realisation that I was wrong about something, whether it was a random thought or something that was carefully thought, I feel a deep anxiety and deep insecurity and eventually, I start to panic and cannot think at all, almost like I suddenly became an idiot or my IQ score dropped my 30 points. 

I am not sure why this happens to me and why I feel like I am personally attacked or feel like I am punched in the stomach when I find out that I was wrong about something 

*(my judgement tells me that either it is because I was raised in a semi-strict background with pushy parents where if you are not on the right, then you are definitely on the wrong; or because I am someone who always took school seriously and when school events are involved like exams or even a classroom interaction, if you posted the wrong answer or the wrong statement, then that means that you are definitely wrong and you get a lower score and in turn, that score affects your self-worth and self-confidence in your ability on whether you are able to think critically)*

But holy fucking God, the fucking of insecurity and despair and the ultimate feeling of self-betrayal and shame just feels like I am somehow struck by lightning and I feel like I am shocked from the inside and cannot move or think or feel. As if my own brain is hijacked"
When anxiety makes you want to do things but depression makes you want to stay in bed,How do people cope?! My anxiety is like “YOU HAVE A DEADLINE” and my depression is like “it’d be really nice to just lay here all day”. It’s to the point where I’m submitting coursework an hour before it’s due because I have almost zero motivation but still get stressed because of the anxiety. I’ve been on propranolol and citalopram for about 11 weeks. The propranolol is great for the physical symptoms of anxiety but citalopram is doing nothing for my depression.

Anxiety as an older male sucks,"Society tells men to be strong, to be stoic and easily face fears. But as an older male with anxiety it just really sucks. I know women won't find me attractive if I'm anxious or more anxious then them, I get it, they don't want to feel the need to take care of me. Also when I'm with other men they see me as weak and often bully and tease. 

Just wanted to vent about how shitty it is being an older male with severe anxiety, socially, makes me even more suicidal. Just want out of this anxious persons body and mind, just want out of all this sometimes."
If anxiety is keeping you awake right now...,"That's fine.

I know you'd rather be asleep. I would too. But we'll get there eventually.

Try not to feel bad if you have something to do tomorrow and you're worried you'll be tired while you do it. 

That happens to everyone.

If the idea of not sleeping right now really stresses you out, get up and do something low impact but productive. 

Update your calendar for the week. Start watching that netflix show you keep meaning to check out. Maybe wash those few dishes that you didn't get to before bed. Sort laundry (this is my favourite, because I hate doing it and often put it off, AND it's quiet.) 

Or pop onto reddit and leave a helpful message for someone."
Shout out to all the S.O.'s who accept us,"Today was a really bad day for me. For some reason, I could not settle down, even when we went out for a round of golf with the gorgeous weather. I was literally shaking the entire time and was trying to control every aspect of the day.
I did check myself, and relinquished control and eventually calmed down. I mentioned to my better half that I was having ""one of those days"" and all she said was ""I know, I get it, we're cool.""
I took her out for dinner and drinks and our evening ended on a very good note."
Be aware of your distorted thinking,"In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.

Personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 

1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. 

Examples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most ""What if..."" type thoughts. 

2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly ""grey area"". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. 

Examples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- ""If it's not positive than it must be negative"". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is ""ruined"" anyway due to the cupcake. 

3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the ""worst possible case"" does come true.  

Example: ""If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats."" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.

""It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me"" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 

4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. 

Example ""That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward"". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.

5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. 

Example: ""That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me"" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to ""evidence"" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).

What types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples? 
"
Anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?,"34 year old male, diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety.  

&#x200B;

I would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  Even when I'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.  

&#x200B;

Its only gotten worse with age.  When I was a little bit younger I""d push through the anxiety and make sure my voice was heard, I would say avoiding confrontation is a behavior I've learned over the years and now it's almost impossible for me to confront someone without stuttering and stammering through it, and that is if I even have the balls to confront someone in the first place.  

 

Then, I wind up even more pissed off and upset because I end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or I just shut down and get super depressed.  

&#x200B;

I just started therapy for my anxiety, am wondering if anyone with similar fears has had success through therapy and beating this type of anxiety"
I went to the store by myself today,Edit: thank you all for your encouraging words❤️

I had a panic attack at work today in front of a room full of patients,"I work as a receptionist in a GP. Been there a couple of months. Today was the first time someone shouted at me. Her appointment was moved from with a doctor to an advance nurse who I explained could also deal with the issue she was having. She slowly got very angry and I ended up crying sat at the desk after she left (missing her appointment). I had to call my coworker down and sat in the toilet for like 10 minutes then 20 minutes with my boss trying to catch my breath. All in all took me over 50 minutes to breath normally again.

I've always had anxiety but never had a panic attack. I've never had a panic attack before, I think it's as I started Citalopram last week. They're only 10mg so I'm surprised at how much its effected me.

Cheers for reading! Just trying to come to terms with what happened

EDIT: Blown away by the response! Not just upvotes but real advice, I posted this in a few sub's to try to get some light shed on what happened and this has just been so helpful and supportive, thank you!"
does anyone else have an extremely chill side to them,"like yeah, i have crippling social anxiety, but also half the time i just don’t care about anything at all and i act so chill and depending on the situation i’m either panicking on the verge of a mental breakdown or don’t have a care in the world and there’s no in between. i feel like i don’t even know what i’m actually like. i like to think i’m super chill but i’m probably not. am i crazy or are other people like this lmao."
"Anyone else with ""high functioning"" anxiety?","Don't mean to rank forms of anxiety, which is why I used the scare quotes - 

I saw three or four therapists who told me, ""wow, sounds like you're doing really well!"" before seeing one who took my anxiety seriously. I'm always early to things, I'm an ""exceeds expectations"" performer at my job, recently finished grad school with a solid GPA, have a great relationship with my significant other and my family, and I just feel all kinds of BAD most of the time.

Anyway, CBT didn't work super well and as nice as my therapist was, they were too expensive/didn't take insurance, so I'm just managing by myself. It's not going super well.

Anyone else in a similar boat? What are you doing that helps you feel better? Since finishing grad school, I plan to try and find a treatment plan depending on my PCP's recommendations.

Thank you <3"
"Me: All I want is a friend, Anxiety: All I want to be is alone",The cruel irony
"Exercise... seriously, do it.","I have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. I’ve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years). Over the years I have used CBT, therapy, and mindfulness meditation to reduce my anxiety with moderate success, but I still “slip” a lot and it can come back with a vengeance sometimes. 

I recently kind of “stumbled” into exercise. I used to hate it and dread it as nothing more than a means to burning calories and eventually losing weight. But after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which I’ve known for years) I casually just said “Ok what the heck?”. Lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can’t I try this as a form of medicine? 

So for the last week, my husband and I have been waking up at five to work out before work (I’ve learned that it NEVER happens after because I’m a teacher and I get exhausted at work). The results? AMAZING. I have felt more at ease in the last week than I have in years. I only work out for thirty minutes and I do a variety of strength and cardio. The type of exercise does not seem to have any effect on the amount of relief. Even just a brisk walk can do it. I can not recommend it enough. Don’t wait to try it like I did. Seriously. A doctor gave me this advice years ago and I wish I would have listened. Go get your CDC-recommended 150 minutes a week and see what it does for your anxiety. I think you will be amazed. "
Does anyone else’s anxiety affect the way they communicate?,"I always feel like I’m too much and that my ideas don’t matter. In turn this causes me to be timid in the way I talk and mumble I guess? I can’t communicate my ideas clearly or confidently which causes confusion in everyone. I just push my ideas aside and turns out I was right the whole time and I end up punishing myself.

It’s really affecting my work as well."
Overcame a panic attack on my own for the first time!,"Triggers: I talk about my panic attack 

I’m so happy I could cry! So there I was, at Starbucks, I had too much caffeine (which I shouldn’t truly be consuming to begin with) and I feel a panic attack coming on and coming on strong. 

Usually I try to shove it down. It never works but I still do it until I inevitably spiral.

But there was this barista sweeping by me. He and I had spoken a few times before this visit and I recalled him saying he was taking a summer course at the nearby community college.

I had my earphones in, trying to listen to music and shakily eat a bagel to calm down. I have social anxiety and have been trying to do some things to get over that these past few weeks such as, smiling when I make eye contact with people and attempting to have casual conversations. 

But there I was, debating whether or not I should even try casually talking to this guy in the midst of forcing back a panic attack and a strong urge to cry. After about a minute (maybe a few, not sure it felt like eternity though) I just turned my head to face him and did it! I asked him how his class was going and although I was very shaky (vocally and physically), we ended up having a great conversation. 

We briefly touched on my anxiety. I even lightheartedly made a joke about choosing whether to have a bagel or panic attack and I seriously don’t know how this didn’t kill the conversation. I wish I could remember what he said afterwards or how the conversation kept flowing. Somehow we ended up talking about a bunch of things. It wasn’t until the end of the conversation that I realized, my panic attack was gone. All the symptoms of my attack were gone as well (I don’t want to list them and trigger someone).

Not saying for people to try this at all, I’m just happy I overcame a panic attack and wanted to share this excitement with somebody. 


TLDR: ended up striking up a conversation with a barista when forcing back a panic attack and ended up overcoming it instead of spiraling for the first time!

EDIT: Thank you guys so much!!! All of this positive feedback and encouragement means so much to me. It seriously hits my core. I sincerely wish I could hug each and every one of you (,: I’ve been trying to reply to as many of the comments as possible. I deeply appreciate this, I really do and I hope you’re all having a wonderful day because you’re all beautiful people ❤️"
Waking up with Anxiety,"Does anyone else ever wake up with anxiety that they cannot explain. Your heart races, stomach is flipped and you feel in complete panic. I’m not sure why this keeps happening but its always first when I wake up and its one of the worst feelings in the world :(  "
"Just had a panick attack while donating blood, everyone was looking at me I'm so embarassed","I wanted to do this thing and be proud of it even tho I'm scared of needles. Right when I was done I started shaking and hyperventilating and the nurses thought my pressure had dropped or something so they were all around me and I was too embarrassed to say it was anxiety. This only made it worse of course and I started crying and ugh, I proud I did it but I'm super embarrassed haha

Edit: Omg you guys, thank you so much for all the kind words! I'm blown away. Thank you."
Fuck cancer man,"I don’t know why I’m posting this on here because it will do absolutely nothing, but there is a sense of release, man I don’t know. 

Today we found out that a woman who basically raised me has kidney cancer. She was a part of my family since before I was even born, I grew up with her she is practically my second mother. 

This is too much man. Things are happening in the world that feel like a punch in the face. 

If you’re reading this you’re probably going through something and don’t want to read about another person but somehow I am here writing this... 

Have a good day, cause it’s not that good here!"
When you have so much to do so you’re stressed and anxious. But you’re too depressed to do anything.,"I’m so exhausted I just want to nap. But then when I wake up I’ll have all this work to do. I am so low atm. 
Can life just stop for a moment so I can catch up 😭
Help :( "
"Does anyone else feel anxious BECAUSE they’re calm? It’s like wow I shouldn’t feel this good, time to feel like shit.","Today I took a 40 minute bath and focused on breathing. I also used an app called HeadSpace (can’t recommend this enough) to meditate and entered a very calm state of mind. Now it’s been 4 hours and I’m still sort of calm from it. But every couple of minutes or so I’ll question why I’m feeling so good, think I shouldn’t feel this good, and start to get anxious. Does anyone else share this feeling?"
Does anyone else feeling guilty when doing nothing?,"Every time I think about giving myself some ""me time"" I get extremely guilty and anxious. There's always something else I should be doing or could be doing. My mind will physically not let me have a day off and it's exhausting. Every time I try to just relax and watch a movie I get attacked by my anxiety telling me the things I should be doing and working on and how I'm going to be a failure and how nothing is going to work out."
Does anyone else's anxiety mean they can't ever enjoy/do anything on sunday because of work the next day?,"Like, i can't even leave the house or do anything outside of the house the day before I have to work because my anxiety tells me there is no point. It is hard to explain..but I just feel I can't do anything the day before work because I will be too stressed and anxious about work the next day and if I went out of the house to do anything, I would be constantly looking at my watch to see how long is left until I have to work (18 hours, 12 hours etc.) and feel sick with anxiety.

By staying in I can try and maintain a routine that helps me, but it is becoming harder as now it is creeping into my saturdays and I am beginning to not want to go out on Saturdays now either. It is so hard to explain why I do this, I am not even sure. People are starting to notice. Does anyone else experience this and have found any ways to manage this? "
I’m sorry if this gets asked a lot but... does anyone else feel too “normal” to not have a mental illness but not “crazy” enough to actually have one?,"I think about this a little more than I should... and then I keep saying “you have nothing wrong with you! Your parents were right, you’re just faking it for the attention! And then think about that until you cry? Bothers me. "
Does anyone else feel like they're just a nuisance to other people?,"I feel like any time I interact with most people, I feel like I'm just a drag on them. "
I finally made an appointment with a therapist!,"And I feel so good about it, I can finally start my road to healing :)"
Does anyone else find job searches paralysing?,"My (30F) anxiety has been around on and off for years. Most days it’s really manageable but as soon as it concerns finding a job, it goes off the charts. It’s as if something deep inside me is triggered and i experience panic attacks, shaking and vomiting. 
I don’t really know what I want to do with my life, career wise. I’ve jumped from job to job, not really liking anything for long periods of time. I stick with something for a while (because at first it’s fine) until I hate it so much I have to leave. And then I spiral, into a whirlpool of terror, shame and fear. 
Recently I found a job I really liked and then management changed and the new boss is awful. My anxious brain says she’s toxic but she’s honestly probably not THAT bad. But she has changed my job role enough that I’m no longer doing what I loved and am a glorified cleaner...so I know I have to leave. 
But after speaking to Mum last night about how I struggle to browse job ads because it’s so hard, she basically said “this happens all the time. You get bored of a job and then panic about finding a new one, you’re just going round and round in circles”. And that set off a middle of the night panic attack. I DONT know what I want to do with my life and I have no idea why the thought brings me such fear. Help?"
Stop clenching your teeth,"Someone once posted this and it hit home with me immediately. With the holidays coming and the weather turning, there's lots to stress about. You only get one set of teeth, and nobody needs a headache on top.

Anyone else get a vague sense of dread and emptiness at night?,During the day I'm fine but at night I feel....wrong
I get why people with mental health problems don't tell others about,"You'll just get gas-lighted with every issue you have with others and it would be made to seem like you're the one with the problem. It's a bittersweet ordeal because the accusers are always trying to be so ""above it all"" and pretend to be some sort of arm chair therapist, telling you to get help. I have anxiety, trust and believe when I say I don't go up attacking people. There's a lot of instances where I don't even talk with people at all."
I got a steady job!,"I did it, y'all! I'm got a steady full time job!

It started out with just an application, then an interview, then training, then my my licensing exam yesterday. Even though I was so nervous through out each step of the process, I'm so thankful and proud that I was able to get this far.

Yesterday as I was waiting for the scores to come back on my exam, I felt sick and wanted to vomit. The suspense was killing me and the entire time I was training, I also kept thinking how awful a job I was doing. But you know what? Everything turned out okay. Good things can happen. Your anxiety isn't right until it's actually right and something bad has happened, so screw it! Do your best!

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone! I'm glad to have your support. Those of you who are waiting to hear back from your job hunts, I wish you the best of luck. We can do this!!!"
"Do you ever have nights where you just accept you’re not gonna sleep, I guess?",It’s 4am. I’ve been trying to sleep since midnight but I don’t really feel tired. This is the first time this has happened to me (also probably partially due to the fact that this is the first night in a while I decided to stay sober).
A poem my sister wrote about her anxiety. She asked me to share in the hope someone resonates with it,"How is it to be in so many places at once

To be yesterday, to be tomorrow and to be now 

To be so connected

Yet so distant

Always entering a new thought

But still can't find a way out

Locked in a prison

Yet still homeless

To hear laughs behind

That make me cry ahead

For wanting her to leave

But not wanting to be alone

Even though I want her to go

I need her to stay

She's all I've ever known

I must learn to love her

She's trying to protect me

We come as a two now and I'm starting to think that might be okay

Does anybody else disassociate?,"I think that's the word I'm looking for. Anyway, whenever I feel an anxiety attack coming on I can physically feel myself leave my body to prevent it from happening. If someone tries to talk to me I become really distant and short. I look into the distance a lot and just try not to be in the moment, because if I am the anxiety will overwhelm me.

Does anybody else experience this or anything like this? Or does anybody know how to deal with this when it happens?"
Anyone else get really worried and restless ~2 hours before having to leave the house?,"Anytime I have an obligation I get really stressed. I can't take a nap cause then I might oversleep, I don't really have enough time to do anything, cook something, watch something....but at the same time it's still too early to leave, cause then I'd just be sitting around at the place

So I just sort of pace around and feel annoyed"
How do you all deal with “everyone at work hates me and I’m sure they’re looking for reasons to fire me” anxiety when you know you’ve never done anything to warrant that?,"You know the feeling?
“That group is polite to me, but I’m sure they don’t like me.”
“The boss is friendly, but I’m sure he/she is scrutinizing me for faults”
“I’m sure everybody hates me for that tiny mistake I made once and no one’s forgotten about.”

You feel this way even though there’s no logic behind it and your rational brain tells you you’re the only one hung up on this. Does anyone else deal with this, and how do you cope?"
"Anybody else ever spend so much time in your head, that when you get up to do something your brain feels totally fried?","I (20F) know it’s bad for my anxiety but all I’ve done today is lay around in my pajamas posting on here and worrying about my current situation or my future or the possible problems my relationship might encounter even though NOTHING is wrong between us right now. 

I think about having a possible nervous breakdown from worrying so much, then having to go to a mental institution, then becoming severely depressed while there because I’m so ashamed of myself for getting to that state, then having a suicide attempt because I can’t take it all. Or how I feel trapped physically and mentally. 

Meanwhile I’m just sitting on my toilet writing this. I’ve been running through these thoughts all day. But now my energy is so low that I don’t know what to do. 

I need to go do something productive because my mind is eating itself. 

Except now I have more anxiety because I feel like I’m in a dream or just floating around since my brain is so exhausted. And now I’m thinking “what if this is dissociation or depersonalization?” That gives me more anxiety. 

I want to sleep but then I think about how sleep is bad for me in this situation too. 

**Lmao**. I hate bad anxiety days man. Hopefully tomorrow is better. 

Love you all ❤️"
"i wish we all could meet each other, show each other lots of respect and love and tell each other how great people we are!","heh, by the way i'm from tbilisi, georgia. had all y'all lived here, i'd organise everything. one love!"

So I voted today and was shaking so badly I couldn't put my ballot into the scanner someone had to do it for me.,But you know what I actually don't feel that bad about it. All it was is a physical response and barely anyone noticed. Normally I would be obsessing about it all day but I'm not. So I thought that I would share I'm actually proud because I didn't let my anxiety prevent me from voting.

I envy my friends and others who don't suffer from mental illness / anxiety.,"I am the only person I know of that suffers from extreme, crippling anxiety (thats why reddit makes me feel less alone). I feel a tinge of jealously when I see my friends able to just live life to the fullest without mental illness issues. And of course everyone has problems and I am in the midst of an anxiety crisis, so its making me feel extra weary. I just wish I could live my live without what feels like carrying an impossibly heavy load on my shoulders. 
I go to therapy twice a week and the medications Ive tried made me feel horrible. Sometimes this shit feels like a curse... I have beauty, intellect, drive and potential but I feel imprisoned by my anxiety when I go through these stressful times.

It was my birthday yesterday and I spent most of the day crying and depressed but we can't give up.. or we lose the chance that things can get better..,"25 was a hard birthday for me. Reflecting on my life and where I'm at had me feeling really down. It seemed out of no where my mental health started making things that were once easy, very very hard. It's taken a toll on my self esteem. I'm starting over with everything. Myself, my home, my career, my education, my health, my relationships, nothing is the same. I've been battling bipolar depression, panic attacks, schizophrenia episodes, constant suicidal ideation and started 2020 in a mental hospital begging to just die. I've lost my identity in the process of everything. I've never been more scared. I'm trying medication again, I'm back in therapy and am having more good days. I'm working on reaching out more to people.  I'm thankful for those who made my quarantine birthday special. My mom made me a home made birthday cake with all my favorite things, my boyfriend had a paint night with me, my sister ordered me dinner to enjoy at home and the birthday wishes from everyone did not go unnoticed. I'm thankful to still be here, still trying, and still fighting & I'm thankful for those that haven't given up on me when I've given up on myself. Here's to 25 and the rest of my life. 🥳🙏🏻"

I may have just quit my job.,"I’m not sure. I did walk out. 

Manager came down today because employee A and B were fighting. Instead of speaking to anyone she stopped in front of me and Screamed about how everyone is going to cut the shit and she’s not dealing with it.  The. She screamed some more about us listening to her and stormed out. 

I’ve been having a panic attack since. I just went to talk to her to tell her I needed to leave and she started right back at yelling. 

So I snapped and told her that this was an unacceptable way to speak to employees, that I was leaving and I might be back on Monday if I want to continue being verbally abused. 

Then I texted the manager, who of course wasn’t there, and told her I need to speak to her before I return. Because of this is an acceptable way of dealing with employees I won’t be back. 

So I think I quit my job. And I’m still sobbing and shaking, 4 hours after the attack started.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. I did not expect the outpouring of support, and I cannot tell you all how much it means to me!"

A dumb (but useful!) little anxiety trick.,"Tl;dr I have a method for remembering that I did something, so I won’t be worrying all day about whether or not I did it, and worrying about the consequences of forgetting to have done it.


Ok so sometimes before work I use my hair straightener. I’m usually in a rush and have to unplug it before I go on my way, of course. But sometimes more often than not I’d be at work freaking out that I *forgot* to unplug it, freaking out that my house was currently burnt to bits, a pile of ash and debris on my lawn.

So I end up texting my mother (who I live with) asking her to please check that I unplugged it. The thing is, more often than not, I did. In fact I almost always do, and if I don’t, *it shuts off automatically anyway*. Yet I still find myself at work stricken with anxiety, wondering if I unplugged my hair straightener.

It’s an outlandish thing to be so worried about, considering I usually unplug it and it shuts off itself anyway, but my google search is still filled with “chances of my house burning down from hair straightener” “how long do automatic shut-off hair straighteners stay on” “hair straightener fire”... it’s not good.

Then recently I decided I needed something to remind me, concretely, that I did unplug it in the mornings when I do. So this is going to sound kind of silly or stupid, but now in the mornings when I unplug it I say, out loud, “I am unplugging my hair straightener”.

I don’t know why it works. Maybe because I say it out loud and hear it back to me and that reassures me. Maybe it’s because it’s a strange action (saying what you’re doing out loud to nobody) that makes me remember that I did it. I have no idea, but once I started doing this I no longer doubt whether I unplugged my hair straightener, the memory sticks in my mind and I can relax.

So I thought I would inform the people on r/anxiety about it to see if they do anything similar, or could maybe benefit from this. Perhaps this would fall under more of an OCD thing but I’ve only ever been prescribed with anxiety so I’m not sure that would apply. But yeah, hope you enjoyed reading about my insanity."
Social anxiety perceived as rude,I have general anxiety as well as pretty horrible social anxiety. It gets taken as me being rude then I'm more anxious around people the next time I see them once I know they don't like me because of it . Vicious cycle . 
Does anyone else feel cringe trying to have a normal conversation?,"no matter what I try and think of saying, I always think it's cringe or just wierd to say even if it isn't.
does anyone else have this problem? and if so how do you get around this thought in your head stopping you from having a conversation or keeping a good one flowing? I just don't know what to say off the top of my head so I need to think what to say but whatever I come up with just doesn't feel like it's either worth saying or just sounds dumb"
Has anyone ever vomited from having such high anxiety?,"23 F. GAD/Depression/USA 

Recently I feel like my anxiety is consuming my life. I’m on no medications for it. I’ve been unable to sleep at night, I can’t calm myself down anymore. Today I was so worked up on my way to work that I started to feel sick and I didn’t even make it all the way to work before I had to pull over and get sick. It was weird because it wasn’t like a lot. Just one swift projecting vomit and then it was over. Is this a symptom of anxiety?

Edit: thank you for all the comments everyone I came back to like 44 notifications so it’s a lot to read through but I just want you all to know I appreciate each one of your responses and insights into your own experiences "
"Your feelings are uncomfortable, but they are not dangerous.","You have a choice when it comes to your feelings. Your body is releasing stress hormones because it thinks you are in danger because you have trained it to think it is in imminent danger. 

I know, because I trained my mind and body to do the same thing.

Accept your feelings for what they are: physical sensations sent by your brain to bluff you because it doesn’t know any better.

Choose which thoughts you follow. When the negative thoughts come, let them come but just don’t follow them because they too are a bluff. A pattern you have fallen into.

If you want something to remind yourself that it’s a bluff, like a prescribed emergency medication or a recording or a mantra or whatever, use it, but accept your feelings and choose your thoughts. You have that power, it’s just buried under anxious nerves.


Full disclosure, I’ve always been anxious as long as I remember. I’ve been medicated for about 7 years now but have never attended therapy (working on it, American healthcare and all that). Recently I have had more panic attacks than ever before, or at least that I’m aware of (looking back I may have chalked some up to being high or drunk as a misguided youth).

But this last time I just happened upon the work of Clair Weekes by way of youtuber Wonderbro.

I don’t mean to say that you don’t need medication or therapy. That’s not what this is about. This is about the reality that those things can bring you to if you let them.

I had a panic attack one week ago. It was bad, I vomited. And like the previous attacks, every day since I have woken up only to have a feeling of dread and tension in my arms wash over me. But I am learning to accept these feelings for what they are: a bluff.


On top of that, I’m giving up caffeine and alcohol to help myself heal, I’m going to hold myself to mindfulness meditation every day using the Oak app recommended by a friend.

I mean well and I hope this comes across the way I mean it.

Healing isn’t easy or fast but I believe all of us can do it.

Accept your feelings.

Choose your thoughts.

Fuck anxiety.,Fuck anxiety.
Does anyone here get stuck in loops/Intrusive thoughts?,"It's the best way I know how to describe it honestly. I get really intense intrusive thoughts which range from wanting to drive my car into a ditch so I don't have to go to work tomorrow, or the second my boyfriend leaves my house it's like ""oh my god what if he gets into a car accident and dies and this was the last time I saw his face"". I can never even recognize that I am doing it in the moment but I obsess and make myself physically sick with anxiety over it until something clicks and I'm fine again. Like in one of the examples I mentioned above, the thing that clicks me back to normal would be when my boyfriend calls when he gets to his house. The entire time I am in the intrusive thought though, I feel like I am walking around in circles inside my head until my feet are bleeding and then I keep going. 

I have talked to my therapist about it and she mentioned that it sounded like obsessive compulsive tendencies (but I want to be clear that she did not diagnose me with ocd) but a solution was not really discussed. Currently my diagnosis is General anxiety disorder, dysthymia, and ptsd. 

I am kind of at a loss because the intrusive thoughts are getting worse and affecting a lot of different areas of my life in really negative ways right now. Breathing techniques don't work very well because I get annoyed at myself and it starts a whole new loop of not even being able to do that right. Telling myself something like ""it is out of my control so I shouldn't worry about it"" doesn't even work because, again, I don't ever realize that I am doing it in the moments. I just don't know if there is some kind of preventative thing I could be doing or I don't know if medication would even help with that stuff because I don't understand how medication helps with anxiety and I come from a family who addicted to any and all narcotics so I have been worried to even try them and my therapists stance on that is that she trusts my judgement but I just don't fucking know and I feel so lost. Please help in any way you can, I am losing my mind and I feel crazy."

When i’m out in public by myself i feel like everyone is watching me and it makes me hyper-aware of my movements and extremely uncomfortable?,"I’m 23/F and I’ve only realized this in the past few years but it’s a feeling i had normalized for as long as i can remember.  
I feel like anytime i’m out in public that people are just watching me and so i’m hyper-aware of how i’m walking, where i’m putting my arms, and in general whatever i’m doing. 
But the thing is, It’s not really that i think people are viciously judging me, it just feels, for example, like i’m doing normal everyday things except there’s an stadium of people watching, like obviously you’d feel like your every move was being monitored and it’s extremely uncomfortable and tense. 
Even if i’m in the car by myself when i stop at a stoplight i think all the people in cars around me are looking at me, also i can’t walk my dogs in the daylight because i feel like everyone is watching me from their houses or cars that are driving by are watching me too. And when i’m at school walking around campus or in classes, and it’s ALL i think about in these situations. i can’t relax in any public setting alone and it’s so awful of a feeling that when i can avoid it i will. I wont even go sit in the library or go to the student union at school, i’ll go sit in my car instead (i’m in my senior year and i’ve been in the student union alone maybe 4x).
If i have to go in public alone i try to do whatever i have to, as fast as i can. Though when i’m with someone that i’m comfortable with i don’t really think about that at all or if i do it’s very very minimal. 
I would like to be able to go out and feel at ease when i do things like, go to the gym, walk my dogs, go to classes, go to the stores, go to the movie theatre,  etc. but I’ve been like this for so long i’m not even sure how i could get better at this point?

Does anybody else delete Reddit post immediately after getting downvoted?,"So yeah, everytime i post something and it gets downvoted i quickly delete the post out of fear of sounding stupid or getting judged.

my method for sleeping with anxiety,"It's no joke. This sub lights up like a Christmas tree at night. With some forms of anxiety, trying to fall asleep is the absolute worst. I've been battling it for many years and I think I have found one way that works for me.

Staying busy (mentally) is the best way to keep anxiety at bay so when we stay busy physically, we can manage. At night, the ""busy"" goes away, so our brains start churning. These thoughts lead to physical changes in our bodies that make us feel like total shit and make it hard to sleep.  i.e. increased heart rate, tension grinding, stomach pain...etc. 

We can't control the physical stuff so we have to start with the mental stuff. You have to learn to manage your thoughts. Sounds impossible, right? It's possible with practice. Here is what I do. 

You HAVE to avoid anything personal to you. I imagine a giant house. Imagine entering this house. The first floor is a long hallway full of doors. Behind each door is all the stuff you can think about that has no personal attachment to you. Television shows you watch, movies, word games, number games (stay away from music because it tends to cause memory recall to something personal) 

The trick is to STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. 

The second floor is anything personal to you. Friends, family, job, school, tasks, money. All these things can trigger anxiety, regret, stress. If you catch yourself thinking about something on the second floor. Back out immediately. 

The basement is the dark place. All your worst fears. Avoid at all cost. 

As for thoughts that are not personal. You will find tricks that work for you. Some things I do...

Take my favorite movie and put myself in it. I imagine myself in all the situations with all the characters and what I would say with them. Same for favorite tv shows. What would I say to each and every character if I had the chance? 

Word games. I try to come up with every word that is two letters only. I come up with words made from another word. Stupid things like that. 

Eventually, you fall asleep. 

I understand this whole thing sounds ridiculous and crazy but the trick is to not touch on anything personal to you. To control your thoughts so you can control the physical reaction to those thoughts. Try it and let me know if it works for you. "

Im super lonely so im really stoked to have a friend"
I feel so lonely right now that it’s brought me to tears,"I’m laying down in bed and for the moment there’s no one to talk to or hang out with and I’m so incredibly overwhelmed with anxiety that I would hug the shit out of the first person I saw. 

Edit: Wait my ribs are actually crushed from so many peeps virtually hugging me at once. So thankful for each piece of encouragement, much love to y’all. Wow."
"Anyone else have their anxiety on-and-off. I’ll be fine for 2 months then bam my anxiety hits me again. Then I’m fine again, then anxiety comes back and so on...",I don’t understand if this is normal. Would be really helpful to know if someone else has this too. Thanks.
"I’ve been on 2 flights today, my first time going on a plane by myself, I got so little sleep that my eyes feel like they’re on fire, but I haven’t had mental breakdown",I consider this an accomplishment
Our collective pep talk for today: It will all be okay,"I want to put this in writing so I remember it, and so my fellow anxiety sufferers remember it:

This is not the end. This is a temporary situation. The only way out is through. (That last one, a therapist told me once when I was going through an extremely difficult time with my anxiety and depression.)

Those of us with anxiety know this feeling of sheer terror very well. It feels so familiar with us that at first, we weren't sure whether we need to panic. Then we panicked, because we are professional panickers. We are also professionals at getting through this. We have a unique set of skills!

My two main coping skills right now:

1) Thinking of time in two-week increments. Right now, my focus is on the next two weeks. (In the area of the US where I live, there are, for the most part, two-week closures.) So, okay, we get to the end of March, and we'll see how things look. 

2) Tune out the people who say...""this could go on for months/years/etc..."" ""life as we know it is over..."" These are not healthy thoughts or sentiments, nor are they helpful. People that don't see things through a lens of generalized anxiety disorder DO NOT understand how triggering comments like these are. This is how we anxiety sufferers think on a daily basis, and we know how damaging it can be. Others do not, because they don't know about the spiral of unrealistic fears we can go into any other day of a normal, boring day/week/month/year.

I hope this helps. We are here to lift each other up. Let's not feed into each other's panic - let's keep things positive. It's not unrealistic to say, this too shall pass. Cliche, but true."
Does anyone else get really anxious over something that’s going to be fun?,"I’m going to an Arctic Monkeys concert soon and I want to use this as an example for what I’m talking about. I’m really fucking glad I
Got tickets to go, don’t get wrong but I’m also weirdly anxious about it. I don’t really understand, maybe it’s because I don’t want anything bad to happen. I’ve found that this continues to happen for a bunch of other things too that I’m initially happy for. Can anyone else relate?"
Does anyone else experience huge anxiety depression and a feeling of doom when you first wake up?,"It doesn't seem to matter how good of a day I had the day before or what happened it seems I always wake up with lots of depression and anxiety that doesn't fade away until two or 3pm. It seems as though my Day is predetermined, Some mornings for whatever reason I wake up with no anxiety or depression and its like I'm a completely different person. Its almost guaranteed that that day will be a good day but the next day is usually back to the same old feeling in the morning that take all day to overcome. I feel like if i could replicate the few days i don't wake up with anxiety that my situation would improve."
I was about to start crying but grabbed a pen and paper and wrote this instead. I didn’t cry. I’m going to buy a notebook.,"It’s not me.
I know it looks like me but it’s not me.
I swear.
I won’t name it or give it a pronoun because it doesn’t deserve one.
Just remember that I’m still in here.
I swear."
I PRESENTED TODAY!!!,"I was nervous and had an anxiety attack before class and on my way. I took deep breaths, got up there and DID IT! I was a little shaky, but I did it and I passed! I feel so accomplished today. I even went out of my comfort zone and raised me hand to answer a question in class when the rest of the students didn't. My answer was for the most part correct ... regardless i am still proud because i didn't have much knowledge on the topic !!! yay!

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the positivity and support. You've all put such an enormous smile on my face. I haven't smiled in a long time, since I just lost my fishy friend and got dumped recently, so again thank you!!! I appreciate every single one of you <3

EDIT: thank you for the silver kind stranger!!"
"Co-workers were down playing anxiety yesterday. Pisses me off when I hear ""everybody has some kind of anxiety.""","To clarify, I don't have anxiety. But my husband does. I've seen first hand what it can do to someone. 

At work yesterday (I'm at a salon) my co-workers were gossiping about some former co-worker of theirs and talking about how much of an attention whore she was and how she's nothing but crazy and drama. Apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. She also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. I thought to myself, what's the big deal? 

But then they started saying things like ""oh she just wants attention,"" ""everybody has some form of anxiety,"" etc. I piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. The response I got was ""well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. ""Nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it."" 

Now I don't even know this person they were talking about. Maybe she does just want attention. But maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. Maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention. I see the stories you guys post here. I have seen my own husband's anxiety and how it affects him. This shit sucks, and it's real. "
My cancer might be back :(,"This is just a venting post because I have no other place to rant.

 I was diagnosed with cancer in 2015 and reached remission in 2016. Never dealt with mental health until I was diagnosed with the disease. Right after my remission I would get slightly anxious about every single change about my body, without realizing that cancer affect the body tremendously. My doctor tried to make me seek some consultation regarding my anxiety but I refused. 

Time past by and I was simply living. Never had any worries or issue that would trick my anxiety until last month. I noticed I have been losing some weight. It wasn't a lot, but I still have been losing weight which made me anxious. Weight loss was one of my first symptoms of cancer. My anxiety was spiraling and I just kept losing weight. I investigated my body and my neck of any nodes. I had a node on my right neck when I was diagnosed with cancer. Couldn't find any so my mind settled a little bit and I finally gained about 1 pound. 3 days ago I was randomly touching my neck and I found two swollen lymp node. My anxiety went from 0-100 in a couple of minutes. 

For the past days I have been crying and shaking. I'm almost convinced that my cancer is back. I have an appointment with my doctor next week. I just want to get it over with. I'm hoping and praying that its not cancer, but the chance is really really slim.
Can't even look at my mother's face without thinking that I will probably break her heart soon. She was my main support in all this. I saw how mentally draining it was for her and now we need to do it all over again. 

I have been standing on the scale for about 5 times a day to see if my weight changing. Yesterday while I was going to sleep, I pinched my node so hard out of frustration. 

I'm just a mess right now.."
Some my anxiety can get so bad that it makes me have to suddenly poop and makes me nauseous.,"I have been working on my anxiety but sometimes when I have a really bad moment I have to suddenly poop and as I’m pooping I’m also nauseous so I have to throw up. And well it’s a mess. 

I’m not sure what to do when this happens, I just end up purging everything in my body and it’s so awful. It doesn’t happen very often but when it does wow it’s terrible.

Does this happen to anyone else? What do you do?
 
Why does this happen?"
I can't believe it but I'm actually certified in Python!!,"A few weeks back I had enrolled for a sort of speedy python corse. I am not a computers guy and have a completely different specialization. Math was never my strong suite. 

If this stumbling stressed and anxious mess of a person could do something like this so can you.

Edit 1- you can find the course here https://letsupgrade.in/fcs

I didn't want to seem too much like a telemarketer and I had dmed people about the course. But everyone was interested.

Edit 2- Wow my first post in Hot. You guys are amazing"
I deleted a post because I got anxiety when nobody responded to it...,"I’m gonna keep this short because I don’t want to spend a long time writing another post that nobody will interact with. Basically I wrote a post for a productivity subreddit explaining how I’ve been extremely unproductive over the last year and a half, only doing something productive for less than 3 hours out of any given day. I waited for over an hour for someone to offer solutions or to relate, but nobody commented and I didn’t even get so much as an upvote. I started to feel really stupid for posting it at all and I couldn’t stop thinking about how everyone who saw it probably thought I’m extremely lazy and have strange priorities and goals for my future. I probably could’ve left it up throughout the night and I’m sure someone would’ve eventually responded, but I was starting to feel anxious about what people must think of me. Does anyone else feel this way when their post is ignored? 

EDIT: Since this post has gotten a bit of attention, can anyone help with the issue I talked about in my deleted post that was ignored? So like...what helps you be productive in life? Should I get a job (even though the thought of it gives me anxiety)? How do you stick to deadlines you set for yourself? I’m having trouble living a fulfilling life at the moment."
To my friends who suffer from anxiety in silence,"Some days at work are great, and others.. not so much. I got my first job earlier this year, after years of dreading it. Here I am now, well liked at work by nearly everyone, making decent money (considering what I do), and financially helping my family. 

Despite everything generally being great, I still have days where I can’t help but take a few minutes to cry in the bathroom at work. I think I hide it pretty well, and I don’t think anyone at work knows what I mess I am sometimes. I don’t ever talk to anyone about my anxiety in depth, and there are likely a lot of people here who suffer in silence too. 

If anyone is reading this at work right now, maybe in the bathroom trying to pull yourself together (or anywhere really), I believe in you and I’m rooting for you! This community is so kind and supportive. I truly believe we are all so brave and courageous and I just wanted to send out a nice message to anyone who may need to hear it from someone but doesn’t have anyone in their life to talk to about their anxiety. 

Whether you’re overcoming a fear of talking to the cashier at the grocery store, or you’re scared to talk on the phone, or to leave your house, or maybe you’re like me and you’re just constantly shaky and worried for seemingly no reason but try to hold your head up high and carry on, I am so proud of you. Celebrate every little accomplishment and step you take. Because anxiety is so ugly and can be so debilitating, every little piece of success should be celebrated. 

I’m always here to chat if anyone needs a friend. I love this community so much. oo"
Big step for me.. seeing a Psychologist today,"It took a lot for me to admit I need help with Anxiety.  Hope this helps!
EDIT: Was referred to a Psychologist who works with a Psychiatrist in case meds are needed for relief."
Does anyone else find that they talk to themselves A LOT in their head when they’re feeling anxious?,I don’t know if it’s just me but whenever I’m feeling super anxious I seem to have full on conversations with myself in my head and just lots of thoughts come in and out of my head. Am I going crazy or is this a normal thing that happens with everyone who has anxiety?
My mental illness makes me feel childish and immature,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for most of my life. I got my first job 2 years ago. In that time, I have had 4 anxiety attacks/breakdowns at work. It happened just last week. I had really hoped that wasn't going to happen again but it did, and I feel so humiliated. Most of my coworkers are my age or younger and they don't act like that. They don't hide in a closet crying and panicking for two hours. 

I also have a bunch of physical health problems that have caused me to have to leave early and call out numerous times. So I can't help feeling that I'm the problem child at work and everyone must think I'm such a drama queen. There's always *something* going on with me. 

I really try to hide it. I try to tough it out when I can and find private places to rest for a minute when I need it. I try not to let people see me get upset. I wish I could help people understand that I don't *want* to do this or be like this. They never say anything, but I'm certain they're silently judging me.

Anyway... yeah. Anxiety sucks."
Reddit doesn’t understand anxiety,"There was an r/askreddit post that got some popularity the other day that said “what instantly put your anxiety from 0 to 100?” And people said things like, when a cop gets behind me, or when I lose my wallet, or when they’re at their MILs house. And all of those things give me nerves, but they don’t compare to my anxiety. Things that give me anxiety? When I touch my phone charger and it feels warm so I don’t want to charge anything the rest of the day in case it catches fire. When I leave my house and wonder if I left the hair straightener on even though I always every day turn it off. It’s a habit. But I still wonder. When I stand up and my foot is numb and I go check the mirror to make sure my face isn’t sloping and my eyes aren’t dilated in case I’m having a stroke. I’m in my 20s and have no health problems. Driving, either riding or driving makes me anxious. These little things that never bothered me before now all of a sudden do. But just randomly. And that, to me, is what anxiety is. Sure, a cop driving behind me makes me nervous. But it’s not the same."
Does anyone else ever experience extreme depersonalization due to anxiety??,"I am currently feeling like I have the biggest hole in my chest and I feel nothing??? I had a day off and I stayed home all day and played video games and had  no contact with the outside world and now that my boyfriend is home, I feel really bad because I’m not talking very much but I truly feel like I just can’t. It’s so odd. I just feel nothing. I’m on 25mg of Zoloft btw "
Anyone else feel psychological pain is worse than physical pain?,"If I had major chronic pain issues, my opinion would be different, but I get mild pain sometimes as most people do, but for me I'm acutely aware of my bodily sensations and it leads to anxiety and often intense panic attacks.  Even though I should be aware that the pain I'm feeling is from something I already understand that I have like acid reflux, my mind wants to connect some dots and believe I might be having an emergency situation.  No matter how many times it turns out to be nothing, I can't help but think it's not going to be nothing this time.  I feel like this fear is a thousand times worse than the pain itself.  I would take pain that is a couple times worse than the pain I get if it would mean I never have to feel anxiety.  It's to a point.  I've had an intense ear infection that I would trade for a panic attack."
"Have a positive day, you’re stronger than you know","Just sending positive vibes to everyone here. We all know how frustrating and exhausting anxiety can be, don’t let that discourage you. You’re so much stronger and you have so much more life in you than anxiety will ever tell you. It’ll discourage you from living your life today. Live your life anyway! 

I get bored at work so if anyone is having trouble feel free to comment/dm and I’ll at least send my regards even if I have no answers for you."
"I would rather do nothing at all times and choose it over going to work, hanging out with friends, and taking classes. Am I alone in this? How do I stop self sabotaging?","Cross posted from r/GetMotivated because I think they may be anxiety related, although therapy and meds have never helped this issue.

I have some sort of mental block around so many things. I just choose... not to do them. Even if they're things I really want to do or need to do.

For example, today I woke up and needed to be at work at 7. And I just chose not to go and went back to sleep. I just don't care about the consequences of things until it's too late. I've struggled with this for years and I don't know what to do about it. And I always quit before I can get fired, so I've had like 10 jobs in the last two years. I ask people to hold me accountable, I've tried working from home, in an office, in food service, it happens with hangouts with friends and writing classes I take... I just choose not to do things.

I have a lot of goals and dreams for myself. I want a lot for myself and I love to do a lot of things. But for some reason my love of doing nothing in the moment always overshadows my dreams. I literally envy people who break bones and stuff because they get to be bedridden for a month and have an excuse for just reading and watching TV and sleeping. I love sick days. I am constantly wishing I could just do nothing even though I feel good once I actually get out and accomplish things.

Does anyone else experience this? It makes me feel like I'm the biggest failure in the world.

She said yes!,"After talking to this amazing girl for over 10 months, I finally got over my anxiety and asked her out, and she said yes!

I just wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit for sharing your advice and giving me the courage to do this, you guys are the best!

If anyone else is in a similar situation, just go for it and ask them out, even though I was shaking as I asked her this, I'm so glad that I finally did it, it's an amazing feeling.

Thank you all once again, I just wanted to share my little positive story :) "
Going to watch a movie at the cinema. Wish me luck,"I kinda stopped going because I was so damn anxious I couldn't focus on the movie, but I'm going to try again today. Hope it goes well


Edit: I fucking did it! I was very stressed and near an attack when I was buying the ticket but as soon as I sat down and the film started I calmed down and enjoyed the entire 3h movie. If I did it, everyone can! You have to push yourself but you'll be happy once you do it"
Post Drinking Anxiety,Anyone else get bad anxiety the next day? Over thinking everyone you said/did. Putting stuff totally out of context.
I went on a date today!,"I’m so proud of myself. I met a guy online and actually took the initiative to get out of bed, face my anxiety and meet a new person. (it paid off so well and i had a great time!) 

A year ago or even a few months ago there’s NO WAY I would’ve been able to do it but I’m slowly improving and i’m so proud of myself! 

Sorry if this isn’t appropriate to post, mods remove it if it doesn’t fit here :)"
Does your heart pound when you get angry or wound up?,I get this all the time
"Relationship anxiety and constant worrying, I’m so sick of it","I have no idea how to deal with this anymore, I’m so sick of irrationally worrying about every small thing; worried if she’s happy, worried if she’s going to leave, worried she’s sick of me and my fucking issues, worried when we don’t talk in the immediate moment, worried when she makes a joke, worried when she doesn’t make a joke. I have an abrupt minimally hostile reaction to almost everything, I can’t take a joke anymore and handle change or big plans awfully. I feel like I need to take hours to think about every small thing that happens in our life but I know I can’t do that because you can’t just spend 8 hours every day thinking your feelings out, that’s fucking exhausting. 

Just constant rumination/unsettled feeling with no foundation behind it but my own insecurity & anxiety. I hate this fucking shit."
Anxiety is so rude.,That is all. That's my whole speech.
Deleting instagram has helped my anxiety immensely.,A few weeks ago i was on instagram and feeling very stressed out and anxious for some reason and the quote from Theodore Roosevelt  “comparison is the thief of joy” came into my head. So on a whim i just decided to delete instagram and it was almost instantly i felt a relief. Im still not quite sure what it was but it has definitely helped and i only reinstall it on Saturdays for football updates. Not saying this is a general thing that will help everyone but it’s definitely helped me.
I walked to the gas station for the first time by myself and bought a drink,It took me a few trys because I kept going back inside but I finally walked down the rode to the gas station. I never went to a shop and paid something by myself because of the anxiety.
I went outside today after 6 months of not leaving my house.,"It all started when I got an appointment to my therapist, but with two days before the appointment day my body and mind went crazy. Started having panic attacks, couldn't eat or sleep and in the end I cancelled the appointment. That was the thing that made me say: ""fuck this, I need to do something"" - called one of my close friends, and we walked and talked for almost three hours. I still had awful sensations but not that intense compared with two years ago when I started having them. 

*sorry for misspeling, I'm not a native english speaker*

Edit: grammar 

L.E.: Today I went to the mall, buyed myself some clothes and went to eat in a fast-food with my friends. I don't know what will be tomorrow, maybe I'm not gonna' leave my house for another 6 months, but today I felt like a human being again."
"Therapy requires money. And to get money you need a job, but you can't get a job because you have terrible anxiety. What do people with anxiety really do? They're in a position, it seems, where there isn't a way out. This seems like a dangerous place to be","I could easily see somebody in this position getting very angry and lashing out. I work coding jobs that don't require any contact with people in the real world. i barely make enough money to get by. If this job goes to shit, which is very likely btw, I could be homeless and screwed.

OH yeah and there's the dreams that you get every night that increase anxiety and the reason why I'm posting on here is because I just woke up from one of them.

But hey, I guess I just chose to be like this. That's what people would have you believe, anyway.
"
"I know this may seem silly, but I just went to IHOP! I have not left my house since July 17th! I just wanted to share this small victory with you guys!","I have panic disorder and agoraphobia. It got increasingly worse this past year, and July 17 I went on medical leave from my job. Aside from 5 Doctors/psychologists visits, I have not left my house once to go anywhere else. When I went to the doctors, I was driven, and I pulled my hoodie over my eyes. Two weeks ago, I started not even being able to go down to check the mail. 

Friday my psychologist told me it was time to go out. She said I was causing myself to get worse by being scared of the outside world. I get anxiety just from having delivery people come to my door. Just the thought of going for a drive seemed like an impossibility.

Today I woke up anxious. Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles. I was dreading every second that went by, knowing I was closer to our(my fiance and mines) 3pm departure time. We chose that time specifically so the restaurant would be nearly empty. At 3 o'clock I started stalling and coming up with reasons why I couldn't go. At 3:45 he pushed me out the door and all but dragged me to the car.

The ride there was scary but I forced myself to just listen to his voice and not hide my eyes. I felt nauseous. When we pulled into the parking lot and He pulled me from the car, he hugged me and told me this will be fun and I am safe and he will protect me. We got inside the thankfully almost empty diner. Our waiter was so nice. He put me at ease a lot. I just chose something without really reading the menu because I just wanted to get the hell out of there. My fiance held my hand and just made small talk, making me start to laugh. I was able to relax a bit and even ate my sandwich! I was anxious, but I didn't feel like I was going to pass out or cry. We left and made it home with almost no problems!

I am very anxious now that I am home(wtf self) but I am so glad I went! It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be! I wanted to share this victory with you guys. This subreddit lets me know that I'm not alone. You people mean a lot to me <3"
When anxiety strikes... walk SLOWER.,Take a stroll around the house in slow motion. It really helps! Just a tip guys and gals.
I went to a hockey game alone.,"I hate going out alone, I hate feeling like everyone is watching me, I hate feeling like I’m being judged.

So it sucked when the person scanning my ticket that I’d bought in a moment of braveness two hours prior said “Oh, you’re here alone?”

It sucked when I had the seat squeezed between two groups of families.

It sucked when I had to get up and someone made sad eyes at me.

But I did it. I stayed the full game, I had fun, I don’t regret going.

The little victories."
Can stress and anxiety cause your body to feel constantly buzzy/nervous in the form of a internal tremor ?,just wondering as I have been suffering with this also relating to my everyday life even when I don't feel stressed out ? 
My anxiety has made me less feminine,"I've always felt pretty girly.  At the beginning of college and prior, I was super preppy and loved dressing up, collecting makeup, doing my hair, etc.  As my anxiety worsened through college, I unconsciously stopped spending time on those things.  

I'm realizing now that part of my anxiety is a fear of looking vain in any capacity.  To the point where I would be afraid to wear earrings or paint my nails or update my profile picture on Facebook because it would seem like I was trying too hard or looking for attention.  

Upon reflection, thats a ridiculous way to live.  I'm literally afraid to express myself in any way because I'm afraid of??? Imposing myself on other people?  Being myself and finding out who might not like me?  The actual reasons aren't 100% clear to me yet, but I'm at least glad I've figured this part out.  

Upon recognizing this, I painted my nails, put on earrings, AND updated my profile picture (to a picture with just me in it for the first time!!) all because I wanted to!  

Weird baby steps.  "
Anyone feels like living is suffering?,"I get spooked by everything. Worry all the damn time. Meds, therapy, nothing helps. It's just periods of overthinking and worrying about random things. Every single day. "
"American politics is REALLY fucking with me, and it's making it hard to be around my family.","I live in North Carolina.  I went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to GTFO.

In high school, I took AP history and AP government and politics and fell in love with America's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  I was at Barack Obama's inauguration with my AP G&P class, and it was wonderful.  One of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.

But here's the thing...  I was ultra, ridiculously, lick-Ann-Coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  I had grown up in a trite Republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of Jesus.  My grandparents are also very conservative.  Fox News was *always* on.

Things quickly began changing when I moved to Raleigh for college.  More racial and religious diversity, time away from Fox News, I discovered Reddit...  And then some personal things happened, as well.  I started having mood swings regularly, I had my first panic attack, I developed epilepsy, I was frequently in the hospital, I had no money...  I got pregnant and had an abortion.

All of this was very eye-opening.  I learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  It was easy to be politically conservative when I was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  But going through all of that changed my view completely.  Suddenly, I saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  I understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications I was on at the time).

NOW, though...  Look at what is going on in the US.  Every time I think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  It makes me so anxious.  My healthcare is going to be fucked with, I wouldn't be surprised if ADA got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  Not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  I might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least I'm white...

My parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  I've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from February-April.  Every time I'm there, if the TV is on, it's on Fox News.  If my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* Trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  It makes me pissed initially, but then I just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  Does he think *I'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???

He's even got a signed picture of Trump and Melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  Even if I was still conservative, I would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.

He asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  He'll loudly commentate on whatever story Fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what I think.  If I didn't have the political background that I do, I would not know WHAT to say.  However, I know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what I do.  It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.

**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**

*EDIT:  You people who are insulting me and PMing me for expressing how I feel need to get some hobbies.  If anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  I didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  I'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, I was just trying to talk to some people that I thought would understand.*

*BUT, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  Because it's the same feeling.*

**Final Edit:  Looks like the trolls have gotten off work and have nothing to do this Friday night.  Well, I do, so I'm done with this thread.  I've gotten what I needed from it.  No replies or PMs related to this thread are going to be addressed.**

**I really don't care, do u?**"
shout out to parents that really try to understand anxiety when their kids get diagnosed with it,"Thanks for actually believing that we have a real disease, because you guys are out here saving lives with that mentality. Rising above the toxic stigma around mental health is so important in helping young people that suffer through it. From a kid with parents that really tried their best when I was growing up, and helped me deal with and process my needs, thank you. "
Does anybody else feel like everybody hates them all the time?,"For example, I went to a little get together with some strangers with my friend tonight. Right as I was leaving, I felt like everybody was staring at me and waiting for me to leave so they could talk shit about how annoying and unbearable I was. Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong. But I notice myself doing this thing a lot where I just assume that I annoy everyone and I’m better off just being quiet so nobody has to put up with me. Anybody else feel similar?"
so anxious i can’t sleep and then i get anxious about getting no sleep😩,"i am about to cry right now. i can’t turn my mind off. i am so stressed and upset about everything😩

Update: Wow thank you guys so much for all the support i had no idea this post would get so much attention and my heart goes out to all of you! Anxiety sucks but we can get through this :)"
High-Functioning Anxiety: Having the fear of not being taken seriously because I seem completely normal.,"I hardly tell anyone I have anxiety because I’m afraid I won’t be taken seriously. My friends would describe me as outgoing and personable, but I do well in social situations only because I’m terrified of people not liking me— it feels like everything I say and every action I do in front of people is calculated. With being “social” along with doing well in school, I’m afraid no one would ever take me seriously if I told them that my brain is always ruminating, I can’t sleep, I have nightmares every night, dealing with panic attacks, etc. Does anyone deal with this? Has anyone with more “higher-functioning” anxiety successfully explained this to someone who was doubtful?"
"You ever feel ashamed of cancelling plans, so you just ghost?",I feel TERRIBLE about this. When I make plans with someone i’m usually excited but when the day and time come to actually show up I retreat into my bubble and go into full panic mode. It’s like i give myself excuses why I can’t/shouldn’t go. And i’m so ashamed to actually cancel I just ghost. I feel ashamed before and after. Sometimes I think it’s easier to be alone all the time just so I don’t have to disappoint anyone.
Anxiety is having a multitude of people scream at you to move a pile of burning tires and you're sitting there begging them to wait until the tires aren't on fire anymore.,"But the tires are never not-on fire, and the people never stop demanding that you move them and moving them is the hardest thing to do and you end up completely burnt and in pain, but when you're done, the people bitch about how the tires aren't in the right place and the pile isn't right and so you need to do it again. So you move the whole burning mess again and then you're nothing but a pile of ashes and your friends think you hate them because you didn't want to show up to the bar as a pile in a dustpan and try to pretend that you're still vaguely shaped like a person.

Then the next day you wake up and people start in with ""Why are you being so lazy? You're just sitting there like a pile of dust."" :(

(I've been on a panic attack for 4 hours now, and it's not going anywhere and every time I ask people to give me a minute, they go full ""Friday Boss"" mode and start yelling about how it needs to get done immediately and I just want to go into a cave and sleep for an entire week.)

Edit: Maybe not technically a 4 hour attack,  I don't really count 10-15 minute periods of normalcy an ""end"" to an attack in the beginning of another. Call it a 4 hour ""chain"" attack if that is a better wording to describe it"
I spend a lot of money on “treat yourself” days and I am so glad.,"I’m single and not earning a lot of money. I’m not fortunate to have a partner or spouse where I live in a household with dual incomes. But I spend about 70-80 dollars a month getting manicures and another 72 dollars for monthly massages. I’ve been doing this for almost two years now and sure that may be a “waste” of money, but I’m so much better at managing my stress and anxiety, which I owe partly to these choices I think.  I feel so relaxed with the massages and getting my nails done just makes me feel pretty. I have shit skin so my nails always look nice to make up for it (in my eyes).  I probably should better learn to budget and cut back in some other areas so that I can save more and eventually buy a house (that’s my goal now) but for now I’m so happy I splurge on this stuff. 

Also I’ve learned to not feel guilty about spending so much on these luxuries.  No good guilting myself for feeling good (ah the struggle of an anxious mind)"
Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab,"Came across news this morning that Hip Hop celebrity Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. He wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned.
Just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety.

Here is the letter: 

""Its been difficult for me to find the words to what Im about to share with you because I feel ashamed. Ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting I’ve been living a lie. It took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something I have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans.
Yesterday I checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges.

I am not at peace. I haven’t been since you’ve known me. If I didn’t come here, I wouldve done something to myself. I simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. Theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. Idk what peace feels like. Idk how to relax. My anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it. I cant make new friends because of it. I dont trust anyone because of it and Im tired of being held back in my life. I deserve to have peace. I deserve to be happy and smiling. Why not me? I guess I give so much of myself to others I forgot that I need to show myself some love too. I think I never really knew how. Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.

I wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.

If all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.

Love and light to everyone who has love for me and I am sorry if I let anyone down. I really am sorry. Ill be back, stronger, better. Reborn. I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed. Im sorry.

I love you,

Scott Mescudi"
