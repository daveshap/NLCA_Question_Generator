"[META] r/NeutralPolitics is opting out of r/all, and by extension, r/popular","EDIT:

To those joining us from r/all and r/popular:

We purposely posted this announcement a day in advance to give frequent visitors an opportunity to subscribe before we disappear from those pages, not expecting that the post itself would make it to the top of r/all. Sorry if this generates any confusion.

If you're a new subscriber, welcome! Please [**read the guidelines**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) before participating.

Dear users,

Over the last few weeks, a number of posts from this subreddit have hit r/all and/or r/popular.

The appearances in those places have driven considerable traffic to the subreddit and swelled our subscriber numbers, but have also attracted contributors who are not only unaccustomed to our rules, but have no interest in abiding by them. This, in turn, has diminished the quality of discourse in the comments and increased the workload for the mods.

So, although growth has its benefits, we’ve determined that the growth we receive from r/all and r/popular is not the kind that is beneficial to this subreddit, especially with the current state of the larger Reddit culture.

Therefore, as of tomorrow, we will opt out of r/all, and consequently, r/popular. From then on, **if you want to see posts from r/NeutralPolitics on your front page, you’ll have to be subscribed and logged in.**

We do expect this to slow our growth, so if you happen to participate in conversations elsewhere with people you think would appreciate this kind of political discussion environment, feel free to refer them here, because we’re unlikely to attract many subscribers from other avenues after this move.

Thank you.

Megathread: Net Neutrality,"##**Due to the attention this topic has been getting, the moderators of NeutralPolitics have decided to consolidate discussion of Net Neutrality into one place. Enjoy!**

As of yesterday, 21 November 2017, Ajit Pai, the current head of the Federal Communications Commission, [announced](https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/933009189991079936?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) plans to roll back Net Neutrality regulations on internet service providers (ISPs). The proposal, which an FCC press release [has described](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1121/DOC-347868A1.pdf) as a return to a ""light touch regulatory approach"", will be voted on next month.

The FCC memo claims that [the current Net Neutrality rules](https://www.cnet.com/news/13-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-fccs-net-neutrality-regulation/), brought into place in 2015, have ""depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation"". Supporters of Net Neutrality [argue](https://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now) that the repeal of the rules would allow for ISPs to control what consumers can view online and price discriminate to the detriment of both individuals and businesses, and that investment [may not actually have declined](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/in-anti-net-neutrality-push-fcc-downplays-data-that-contradicts-narrative/) as a result of the rules change.

Critics of the current Net Neutrality regulatory scheme argue that the current rules, which treat ISPs as a utility subject to special rules, is [bad for consumers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/07/07/why-treating-the-internet-as-a-public-utility-is-bad-for-consumers/) and other problems, like the lack of competition, [are more important](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/we-dont-need-net-neutrality-we-need-competition/). 

---

**Some questions to consider:**

* How important is Net Neutrality? How has its implementation affected consumers, businesses and ISPs? How would the proposed rule changes affect these groups?
* What alternative solutions besides ""keep/remove Net Neutrality"" may be worth discussing?
* Are there any major factors that haven't received sufficient attention in this debate? Any factors that have been overblown?"
First Debate Fact-Checking Thread,"Hello and welcome to our first ever debate fact-checking thread!

We announced this [a few days ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/548hi7/announcing_our_debate_factchecking_initiative/) but here are the basics of how this will work:

* **Mods will post top level comments with quotes from the debate.**

This job is exclusively reserved to NP moderators.  We're doing this to avoid duplication and to keep the thread clean from off-topic commentary.  Automoderator will be removing all top level comments from non-mods.



* **You (our users) will reply to the quotes from the candidates with fact checks.**

All replies to candidate quotes must contain a link to a source which confirms or rebuts what the candidate says, and must also explain why what the candidate said is true or false.

Fact checking replies without a link to a source will be summarily removed. No exceptions.

* **Discussion of the fact check comments can take place in third-level and higher comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules still apply.

We are now beginning to post questions about the report.  I'll update this with links to various threads we have here:

1.  [What new information about links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign have we learned from the Mueller report?](https://old.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/beo2wd/what_new_information_about_links_between_the/)

2. [What evidence does Volume II of the Mueller report provide that suggest actions by the President were made with the intent to obstruct justice?](https://old.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/beoek3/what_evidence_does_volume_ii_of_the_mueller/#)

3. [Is the Mueller Report's analysis of obstruction consistent or inconsistent with AG Barr's (unsolicited) June 8, 2018 memo to Rod Rosenstein?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/bepryw/is_the_mueller_reports_analysis_of_obstruction/#) (This is a user post)"
Is there precedence over the past 100 years for the White House to block media outlets from press briefings?,"[""CNN and other news outlets were blocked Friday from an off-camera White House press briefing""](http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/24/media/cnn-blocked-white-house-gaggle/index.html).  According to CNN, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Politico, and Buzzfeed were also blocked.  The Associated Press and Time magazine boycotted the meeting in protest.  

From the same CNN article:

> ""The White House Correspondents Association also protested the move.

> ""The WHCA board is protesting strongly against how today's gaggle is being handled by the White House,"" it said in a statement. ""We encourage the organizations that were allowed in to share the material with others in the press corps who were not. The board will be discussing this further with White House staff.""

Is there precedence in modern history for this kind of selective screening by the White House?"
Did AG Jeff Sessions commit perjury during his confirmation hearing when he didn't disclose prior meetings with the Russian Ambassador?,"Per [this report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?utm_term=.9f4d8f2f3967&wpisrc=al_alert-COMBO-politics%252Bnation#comments) from the Washington Post, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ""spoke twice last year with Russia’s ambassador to the United States... encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions’s confirmation hearing to become attorney general."" 

When asked by Sen. Al Franken (D - MN) what he would do if it was revealed that anyone in the Trump campaign spoke with Russian officials, Sessions said ""I’m not aware of any of those activities... I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.""

My question is, does this constitute perjury? And if not, does this make it anymore likely that a special prosecutor will be appointed to investigate the Russian ties with the Trump campaign? "
House Republicans revealed their proposed replacement for the Affordable Care Act yesterday. What are its pros and cons?,"**[Link to full bill](https://housegop.leadpages.co/healthcare/)**

Yesterday, House Republicans released the full text of the bill they hope will fulfill the ""replace"" part of their ""repeal and replace"" policy with regards to Obamacare. The 123 page bill contains [the following major changes](http://www.vox.com/2017/3/6/14829526/american-health-care-act-gop-replacement): 

* The individual mandate is removed.  Instead insurers can charge people who have had a 2 month coverage gap up to 130% of normal prices.

* Keeps guaranteed issue and community rating, though age bands permitted are wider.

* Medicaid expansion stops taking new people in 2020.


* Medicaid becomes ""per-capita block granted""

* The ban on discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is preserved

* Children can still stay on their parents' coverage until age 26

The plan has already been [criticized](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/gop-s-obamacare-replacement-plan-faces-four-big-obstacles-n730001) on a number of grounds, with many GOP lawmakers [already stating](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/conservatives-revolt-against-gop-obamacare-repeal-replacement/518775/) they oppose it. Criticisms range from it keeping too much of Obamacare's architecture, merely tweaking it rather than properly replacing it, while the left has accused it of favoring the wealthy and not addressing major issues with healthcare in the US.

**Is the new bill viable as an alternative to Obamacare? A solution to America's healthcare issues? Who currently supports and opposes it, and whose support is still needed?**

"Do the recently released emails relating to Donald Trump, Jr. indicate any criminal wrongdoing?","The New York Times has gained access to an email conversation between Donald Trump Jr. and Rob Goldstone.

This morning emails were released which show that Trump Jr was aware that the meeting was intended to have the Russian government give the Trump campaign damaging information on Hillary Clinton in order to aid the Trump campaign.  

In particular this email exchange is getting a lot of attention:

>Good morning

>Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.

>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.

>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin.

>What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?

>I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.

>Best

>Rob Goldstone

>>Thanks Rob I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?

>>Best,

Reminder: tomorrow is election day in the United States!,"Tuesday, November 6, 2018 is the day of the [midterm elections in the United States.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_2018)

All 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, 35 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate, 39 state and territorial governorships, various state ballot initiatives, as well as numerous other state and local elections will be contested.

**Voting FAQ:**

Q: Is it too late to register to vote?     
A: It depends. Some states have same-day registration. [Look up your state's information here.](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/)

Q: Where do I vote on Election Day?     
A: Voters are assigned a polling place based on the address where they're registered. [Find your polling place here.](https://www.headcount.org/find-your-polling-place/)

Q: What are the hours of my polling place?     
A: [Find the opening and closing times for your polling place here.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_\(2018\))

Q: Do I need to show identification to vote?     
A: Most states require some form of identification either when you register and/or when you vote. The rules vary state by state. [This interactive map will help you determine the requirements for your state.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx#Laws%20in%20Effect)

Q: Where can I research what's on my ballot?     
A: Per [this recent thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/9kwm02/best_website_to_get_ballot_summaries_that_are_as/) check out [BallotReady,](https://www.ballotready.org/) [OnTheIssues,](http://www.ontheissues.org/) [Ballotpedia,](https://ballotpedia.org/) [We Vote,](https://wevote.us/) or the website for your state's Secretary of State.

A: No. Your ballot is still valid if you leave some contests without a vote.

Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?     
A: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot.

Is there evidence to suggest the firing of James Comey had a motive other than what was stated in the official notice from the White House?,"Tonight [President Trump fired FBI director James Comey.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=span-ab-top-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news)

The Trump administration's stated reasoning is laid out in [a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/09/us/politics/document-White-House-Fires-James-Comey.html)  That letter cites two specific incidents in its justification for the firing: Comey's [July 5, 2016 news conference relating to the closing of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html) and Comey's [October 28 letter to Congress concerning that investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/oct-28-fbi-letter-to-congressional-leaders-on-clinton-email-investigation/2113/) which [was followed up by a letter saying nothing had changed in their conclusions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/06/us/politics/fbi-letter-emails.html) 2 days before the 2016 election.

>Senior White House and Justice Department officials had been working on building a case against Mr. Comey since at least last week, according to administration officials. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been charged with coming up with reasons to fire him, the officials said.

However, we also know people use NP as a source for finding good quality sources.

Our plan tomorrow is then twofold:

1. As soon as possible after the report is out, we will put up a post with a link to it, but the post will be locked to comments.

2. After a few hours of the report being out, we will either make a new discussion thread or open up comments on the link post (I'm open to user suggestions on which of these is better).

Net Neutrality: John Oliver vs Reason.com - Who's right?,"John Oliver recently put out another Net Neutrality segment [Source: USAToday Article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/05/08/john-oliver-net-neutrality-last-week-tonight-ajit-pai/101422806/) in support of the rule.  But in the piece, it seems that he actually makes the counterpoint better than the point he's actually trying to make. [John Oliver on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak&t=4s)

Reason.com also posted about Net Neutrality and directly rebutted Oliver's piece.  [Source: Reason.com](https://reason.com/reasontv/2017/05/19/net-neutrality-nixed-why-john-oliver-is). [ReasonTV Video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6txA3pI0xJI)

It seems to me the core argument against net neutrality is that we don't have a broken system that net neutrality was needed to fix and that all the issues people are afraid of are hypothetical.  John counters that argument saying there are multiple examples in the past where ISPs performed ""fuckery"" (his word).  He then used the T-Mobile payment service where T-Mobile blocked Google Wallet.  Yet, even without Title II or Title I, competition and market forces worked to remove that example.  

Are there better examples where Title II regulation would have protected consumers?"
"Trump so far — a special project of r/NeutralPolitics. Two years in, what have been the successes and failures of the Trump administration?","One question that gets submitted quite often on r/NeutralPolitics is some variation of:

--------

There are many ways to judge the chief executive of any country and there's no way to come to a broad consensus on all of them. **US President Donald Trump has been in office for two years now. What are the successes and failures of his administration so far?**

What we're asking for here is a review of specific actions by the Trump administration that are within the stated or implied duties of the office. This is not a question about your personal opinion of the president. Through the sum total of the responses, we're trying to form the most objective picture of this administration's various initiatives and the ways they contribute to overall governance.

Given the contentious nature of this topic (especially on Reddit), we're handling this a little differently than a standard submission. The mods here have had a chance to preview the question and some of us will be posting our own responses. The idea here is to contribute some early comments that we know are well-sourced and vetted, in the hopes that it will prevent the discussion from running off course. 

Users are free to contribute as normal, but please keep our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in mind before participating in the discussion. Although the topic is broad, please **be specific** in your responses. Here are some potential topics to address:

* Appointments
* Campaign promises
* Criminal justice
* Defense
* Economy
* Environment
* Foreign policy
* Healthcare
* Immigration
* Rule of law
* Public safety
* Tax cuts
* Tone of political discourse
* Trade

What is the severity of Michael Flynn's actions that led to his resignation? Is calling it treason hyperbole? Can he (or others) be prosecuted for his actions?,"With the resignation of Flynn, lots of headlines have been flying around on cable news and social media. Many allude that his actions we're treasonous. Certainly they were hypocritical when compared to his past comments towards HRC in the general election: http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/14/14609618/michael-flynn-trump-hillary-clinton

Some major organizations claim he's in violation of the Logan Act:
https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/logan-act-flynn.html

This opinion piece from the Denver Post makes accusations of sedition.
http://www.denverpost.com/2017/02/13/did-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn-commit-sedition/

Does any of these fall under what I imagine is a narrow definition of treasonous behavior?

If Flynn is prosecuted, what does this mean for other officials in the admin, or even Trump himself?"
"The ""real live experiment"" in Kansas has ended. What did we learn?","In 2012, Republicans in Kansas, led by Governor Sam Brownback, passed [sweeping reforms to the tax law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Senate_Bill_Substitute_HB_2117) that he [touted as a ""real live experiment""](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/jun/19/brownback-gets-heat-real-live-experiment-comment-t/) designed to spur job and business growth. Arthur Laffer, the main architect of the supply side economics policies of the Reagan administration, was a [consultant for, and proponent of, the Kansas experiment.](http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2012/03/06/laffers-supplyside-economics-staging-a-comeback) 

Yesterday, faced with perennial budget shortfalls, the Kansas Legislature (in which Republicans still hold a majority) [voted to override Gov. Brownback's veto of a tax hike,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/07/kansas-republicans-raise-taxes-rebuking-their-gop-governors-real-live-experiment-in-conservative-policy/) thus ending the five-year experiment. The bill enacts a series of changes, phased in over the coming years, that will bring the tax structure roughly back to its pre-2012 form.

So, now that the experiment has ended, what did we learn? Can we extend the conclusions to other states, or was there something specific about the economic situation in Kansas that caused it to have the results it did? Are there states similar to Kansas that did not enact such policies that we can use as a control? Have other states or countries had significantly different results from forays into supply-side economic policy?

* Prior to the Kansas reforms, the Center for American Progress pronounced, [""Three decades of empirical economic data shows that supply-side economics doesn’t work.""](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2012/08/01/11998/the-failure-of-supply-side-economics/)"
"What, if any, gun control measures have been shown to be effective in reducing violent crime and/or suicide?","**Mod note:** We have been getting a large number of submissions on gun control related subjects due to [the recent shooting in Florida.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/us/parkland-school-shooting.html)  This post is made on behalf of the mod team so that we can have a rules-compliant submission on the subject.

The United States has [the highest rate of guns per capita in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) at about 1 gun per resident, nearly twice as high as the next highest country, Serbia, which has about 0.58 guns per resident.

That number however masks a fairly uneven distribution of firearms.  [Roughly 32-42% of Americans report that they live in a household with guns,](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/guns-dont-know-how-many-america/index.html) though the only data we have come from surveys, and therefore there is a margin of error.

Both of the principal surveys showed that rates of gun ownership declined from the 1970s-1990s and have been about steady since.

Surveys also estimate that among gun owners, the number of firearms owned is highly skewed, with a very small portion of the population (about 3%) [owning half of all firearms in the US.](https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/)

The US also has a very high rate of homicide compared to peer countries, and an about average suicide rate compared to peer countries.  [Firearm homicides in the US are much more common than all homicides in any peer country](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/) however even US non-firearm homicides would put the US above any western country except the Czech Republic.  The total homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000 is more than twice as high as the next highest (Czech) homicide rate of 2.6 per 100,000.

The US has a much higher firearm suicide rate than peer countries (6.3 per 100,000) but a fairly low non-firearm suicide rate, which puts the US about middle of the pack on suicides. (same source as above paragraph)

Given these differences, is there any good evidence on different measures relating to guns which have been effective in reducing violent crime, especially homicide, and suicide?  Are there any notable failures or cases where such policies backfired?"

AHCA Megathread,"We are getting a ton of questions about the AHCA and so we have decided to make a megathread on the subject.

A few basic Q&As to start:

**What is the AHCA?**

It is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.

**What does it do?**

Lots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)

**What are the recent amendments to it?**

There have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:

* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.

* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for ""high risk pools"" for persons with pre-existing conditions.

**What's going on with it now?**

House leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.

**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)

The House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)

**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.


The AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.

**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.

**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.

A Federal judge ruled on Friday that an all-male military draft is unconstitutional. What impact does this have on Selective Service registration and future U.S. military drafts?,"Formed in 1917, the [Selective Service System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Service_System#Who_must_register) is an independent Federal agency that keeps records of individuals registered for a potential military draft.

Failure to register used to result in penalties, however these have not been prosecuted in many years (from Source 1):

> The last prosecution for non-registration was in January 1986. In interviews published in U.S. News & World Report in May 2016, current and former Selective Service System officials said that in 1988, the Department of Justice and Selective Service agreed to suspend any further prosecutions of non-registrants. No law since 1980 has required anyone to possess, carry, or show a draft card, and routine checks requiring identification virtually never include a request for a draft card.

In practice, the last draft was decades ago and enrolling in the military is voluntary today, however the Selective Service has several administrative roles not pertaining to the military. Some of these administrative roles incentivize enrollment (from Source 1):

> Registration with Selective Service is also required for various federal programs and benefits, including the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), student loans and Pell Grants, job training, federal employment, and naturalization.

----

In 1981, the Supreme Court in [Rostker v. Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostker_v._Goldberg) upheld the constitutionality of the all-male draft. This decision was partly determined based on the limited roles women could have in the military at the time.

On Friday, a [Federal judge ruled](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/24/military-draft-judge-rules-male-only-registration-unconstitutional/2968872002/) that women have sufficient access to combat roles in the military and that Rostker v. Goldberg no longer applies.

The [judge's ruling](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5747780-190224-SELECTIVE-SERVICE-DECISION-Full.html) (PDF warning) was a [Declaratory Judgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_judgment), and probably doesn't have great implications right now (from Source 3):

> ""Yes, to some extent this is symbolic, but it does have some real-world impact,"" said Marc Angelucci, the lawyer for the men challenging the draft. ""Either they need to get rid of the draft registration, or they need to require women to do the same thing that men do.""

---

I have a couple of questions:

1: How does a Declaratory Judgment work, and what does it do?

2: Does this ruling have any effect on the Selective Service System in the immediate? What about if another draft were to be held?

What new facts did we learn from these documents today?  The Manafort/Gates indictment is an allegation yet to be proven by the government.  The factual statements in the Papadopoulos plea however are admitted as true by Mr. Papadopoulos.

"If States representing 270 electoral votes pass the Popular Vote Compact, the Electoral College is effectively dead. The compact currently has 172 electoral votes in 11 states, and more states will hold votes to join. Is this constitutional? What power do states have over their chosen electors?","Several states have banded together to effectively overturn the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) through passage of the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact).

Currently representing [172 electoral votes in 11 states and the District of Columbia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/26/popular-vote-could-decide-presidential-election-if-these-states-get-their-way/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.13ea77579088), the Popular Vote Compact would de-facto turn national Presidential elections into a popular vote should states representing 270 electoral votes join.

---

In practice, the way this would work is your state electors would go to the winner of the national popular vote instead of your state vote.

**For example, if you live in California and a Democrat won the state popular vote 57%-43%, the Democrat would typically be given the whole 55 electoral votes California has.**

**In this new system, California would look to the winner of the national popular vote. If California still voted 57%-43% for a Democrat and the national vote was 51%-49% in favor of a Republican, the state would give their 55 votes to the Republican.**

---

On the mechanism (from 2nd source):

> The compact would modify the way participating states implement Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in the Electoral College. The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors, and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate their states' electors (although systems that violate the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination, would be prohibited). States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide (the ""winner-take-all"" system).

On enactment (from the 3rd source):

> “When we hit 270, all these bills take effect simultaneously. Then there’s a pool of 270 electoral votes that’s going to go to whomever gets the most votes in all 50 states,” Koza added.

2: States aren't exactly getting rid of their electoral votes - they're just writing legislation that changes the prerogative of their electors. What power do states have over their electors?

Is there actually evidence in the leaked DNC emails of Hillary offering federal positions to large donors?,"In the last 24 hours, articles claiming that Hillary offered federal positions to top donors have made it to the top of /r/SandersForPresident, /r/The_Donald and /r/politics as well as /r/all.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren has announced an income based student loan debt relief policy. What are the pros and cons of this proposed policy?,"Massachusetts senator and 2020 presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren, announced a policy proposal that would forgive the student loan debt of approximately [95% of the 45 million Americans with student loan debt](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/elizabeth-warren-student-debt-college-tuition-plan/index.html). Her policy is income based with families making more per year receiving less relief.

>Warren's plan would offer debt relief based on income. Households that make less than $100,000 a year would get $50,000 in loan cancellation, with the amount of relief getting gradually smaller as income level goes up, with households that make more than $250,000 not eligible for any debt relief.

This relief would apply to both federal and private loans, providing [loan cancellation or some type of relief for approximately 75% of Americans with outstanding loans debt](https://elizabethwarren.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Experts-Letter-to-Senator-Warren-.pdf). Her policy would also see an investment of an additional $100 billion over the next 10 years to Pell Grants, making them more available to students. If enacted, her policy would make [tuition and fees for all public higher education programs free to all Americans](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f?subsource=GS-65766185245-elizabeth%20warren-p-335466676005&gclid=CjwKCAjwzPXlBRAjEiwAj_XTEZm3EblAFgQHv2JYwl2qvLeEjE8QTKGEF7uwHrC77sWngi2CwQONLBoCPwUQAvD_BwE&refcode=WFP2019-LB-GS-NC&refcode2=GS-65766185245-elizabeth%20warren-p-335466676005).

Sen. Warren's campaign estimates this policy to cost about $1.25 trillion over 10 years. She proposes a wealth tax, which she calls the ""Ultra-Millionaire Tax,"" which would be a 2% per year tax on families whose wealth exceeds $50 million. According to her website she estimates about 75,000 families would be affected by this ""Ultra-Millionaire Tax.""

"Andrew McCabe has been fired. Is this firing irregular, or is it in accordance with precedent and standard operating procedures?","[Here is the statement](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-sessions-statement/statement-by-attorney-general-on-firing-of-fbis-mccabe-idUSKCN1GT04O) issued by Attorney General Jeff Sessions:


>After an extensive and fair investigation and according to Department of Justice procedure, the Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided its report on allegations of misconduct by Andrew McCabe to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).


>The FBI’s OPR then reviewed the report and underlying documents and issued a disciplinary proposal recommending the dismissal of Mr. McCabe.  Both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.



>The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability.  As the OPR proposal stated, ‘all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand.’ 


>Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department’s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.”


[Here is McCabe's statement](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/mccabe-fired-statement-fbi-deputy-director/index.html) criticizing the decision:


>I have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time.


>For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The President's tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us.


>No more.


>The investigation by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI's involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau, and to make clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.


>The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact, it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.


>But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.


>Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG's focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday's comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.


>This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel's work.


>I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the midst of chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was privileged to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.


>I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred.

"Dozens of House Republicans occupy the SCIF to stall the closed-door testimony of Laura Cooper. What are the laws regarding closed-door sessions and the usage of the SCIF, and can any sort of legal action be levied against these Republican lawmakers for such an action?","This morning, Laura Cooper was scheduled to testify in the ongoing impeachment inquiry regarding President Trump and aid to Ukraine. As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, she called in to speak about the mechanisms behind Ukranian aid and also the fallout from the White House's suspension of said aid over the summer. However, shortly before her testimony could begin, members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Republican Matt Gaetz of the Flordia 1st, held a short press conference in the ""basement of the Captial"" in which they laid out complaints about the secrecy of the testimony and of the impeachment inquiry itself. [\[Fox News\]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-in-blasting-secret-impeachment-probe-before-attempting-to-storm-the-proceedings)

My question revolves around the nature of these closed-door hearings and the SCIF itself. What are the actual rules surrounding how it can be used and who can enter the room? What are the house rules on closed-door hearings and who can enter those? Many Republicans seem to be basing criticism on the rules and how unfair they are to the American voter whose representative can't get information about these hearings and testimonials, so how were these rules decided on if there is such a huge issue around representatives not having access to information?

I have a couple of questions:

1: How many Colleges and Universities seek Federal research money? Specifically, what percentage of Universities and Colleges seek Federal research money?

2: The written order has not yet been released, so there's some ambiguity to what ""support free speech"" means, but the President left little ambiguity that he believes there is a free speech problem on America's campuses. 

What specifically have Colleges and Universities done to limit free speech? Is this a new occurrence? Have they stated why they are doing it?

### Absolute immunity definition.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity) has the following definition:

> Absolute immunity is a form of legal immunity for government officials that confers total immunity from criminal prosecution and lawsuits so long as they are acting within the scope of their duties.

[Julian Epstein](https://www.nationalmemo.com/former-counsel-hicks-cant-claim-absolute-immunity-may-invoke-fifth-amendment/), former Democratic chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee says:

> “Absolute immunity would be a claim by the White House that none of the staff or the president need to answer any questions in a congressional proceeding or a legal proceeding,” Epstein explained to CNN, quickly adding that when President Richard Nixon tried to claim absolute immunity during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that there was no such thing.

Chairman Nadler characterizes it on pg 11 of the transcript as:

> Chairman Nadler: With all due respect, that is absolute nonsense as a matter of law.

[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/explainer-congressional-testimony-limits/index.html) references a [OLC memo](https://www.justice.gov/file/30896/download) from 2014 which states:

> For the President’s absolute immunity to be fully meaningful, and for these
separation of powers principles to be adequately protected, the President’s
immediate advisers must likewise have absolute immunity from congressional
compulsion to testify about matters that occur during the course of discharging
their official duties.

Under what circumstances are children of aliens being separated from their family? What changes are possible within current law or under proposed laws?,"According to [this NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/16/620451012/dhs-nearly-2-000-children-separated-from-adults-at-border-in-six-weeks) ""1,995 minors were separated from their ""alleged adult guardians"" at the southern border in just over a monthlong period"", following DOJ's new ""[zero tolerance](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/15/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-immigration-prosecutions-families)"" policy for illegal crossings. In part, the policy states

""The Attorney General directed United States Attorneys on the Southwest Border to prosecute all amenable adults who illegally enter the country, including those accompanied by their children, for 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), illegal entry.

""Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).""

While the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why

[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.

Additionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.

The ""zero tolerance"" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that ""[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/). ""

On the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because ""the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held"", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested. ORR is currently sharing sponsor information with DHS, further stoking these fears. According to [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html) CNN article, the House is currently debating a bill that would overrule the 20 day limit, allowing families to be kept indefinitely at ICE family facilities.

So, to restate the question, under what circumstances are children being separated from their family? What alternatives are available under existing or proposed laws?"
How Can the Fed Inject $1.5 Trillion Into the Economy?,"It was just announced that the Federal Reserve will [inject $1.5 Trillion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-to-inject-1-5-trillion-in-bid-to-prevent-unusual-disruptions-in-markets-11584033537) into the economy in order to offset losses in recent days.

What have we learned from the principal conclusions of Robert Mueller's investigation released tonight?,"Tonight, Attorney General Bill Barr sent to Congress [a letter](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/AG%20March%2024%202019%20Letter%20to%20House%20and%20Senate%20Judiciary%20Committees.pdf) summarizing the findings of Special Counsel Mueller. This is just Barr's summary of the findings made by Mueller, and not Mueller's full report [sent to Barr on Friday,](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/708-attorney-general-william-barr-letter-mueller/b7fd3a05ab618bad8544/optimized/full.pdf#page=1) which has not been released.

In the letter, Barr relates that Mueller said:

>[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.

The letter further states that Mueller investigated whether the President obstructed justice in relation to the investigation.  The report, according to Barr:

>sets out evidence on both sides of the question and leaves unresolved what the Special Counsel views as 'difficult issues' of law and fact concerning whether the President's actions and intent could be viewed as obstruction.  The Special Counsel states that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

The letter then says it was left to Barr to decide whether the conduct constituted obstruction.  He says that he and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein ""have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.""

The letter further states that most of the factual information related to obstruction was ""the subject of public reporting.""

Mueller [was appointed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download) in 2017 to investigate  ""any links and/or coordination bet ween the Russian government and individuals
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.""

Trump.

* What new information have we learned tonight about the matters Mueller was charged with investigating?  

* Related to the Barr/Rosenstein determination on obstruction, what are the facts which we know from public reporting they may have been considering?

Donna Brazile said the DNC's joint fundraising agreement with Hillary's campaign wasn't illegal. Does this hold water? How does US law regulate political parties anyway?,"Politico released this story today:

https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774

And I'm trying to figure out how big a deal it is.

Brazile says the joint fundraising agreement between the campaign and the party ""specified that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics, and mailings.""  But not far below, she says it ""was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical.""

Is this true? Does the US have any regulation that governs fairness in political party nominee selection, or do the parties have total control to set their own rules?"
Title II vs. Net Neutrality,"I understand the concept of net neutrality fairly well - a packet of information cannot be discriminated against based on the data, source, or destination.  All traffic is handled equally.

[Some people, including the FCC itself, claims that the problem is not with Net Neutrality, but Title II](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0427/DOC-344591A1.pdf).  The FCC and [anti-Title II arguments](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/436807/net-neutrality-government-control-your-internet-service) seem to talk up Title II as the problem, rather than the concept of ""treating all traffic the same"".

Can I get some neutral view of what Title II is and how it impacts local ISPs?  Is it possible to have net neutrality without Title II, or vice versa?  How would NN look without Title II?  Are there any arguments for or against Title II aside from the net neutrality aspects of it?  Is there a ""better"" approach to NN that doesn't involve Title II?"
Is it illegal for a president to propose a pardon to someone in advance of their potentially illegal activity?,"[Reporting](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/trump-cbp-commissioner-pardon/index.html) indicates that President Trump floated a pardon to CBP Head, Kevin McAleenan, in order to encourage him to ignore US law in pursuance of Trump's border policy preferences.

>Two officials briefed on the exchange say the President told McAleenan, since named the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that he ""would pardon him if he ever went to jail for denying US entry to migrants,"" as one of the officials paraphrased.

Simply put, is this illegal? If the allegations turn out to be true, would it be a violation of any statutes, and if so, which ones?

The only relevant jurisprudence I've found so far appears to be in [Ex Parte Garland (1886)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/71/333.html), which states of the federal pardon power:

>The power thus conferred is unlimited, with the exception stated. It extends to every offence known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken, or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.

What evidence is there for the premise that privatization of public goods will reduce costs for the consumer?,"For quite some time, there has been a debate between conservatives and liberals about the privatization of public goods such as [bridges, trains, metro system, etc](https://panampost.com/editor/2017/01/19/congress-privatize-washington-d-c-metro/).

What are other instances where privatization of public services has led to either positive or negative outcomes?

And -- probably the more interesting question -- what distinguishes the instances that have failed from the instances that have succeeded?

Is it universally the case that privatization will lead to reduced costs and improved services? Is there any basis for the claim that privatization is always better? Or are there considerations on a case-by-case basis that would determine whether privatization is favorable or not? "

Kislyak said Kushner suggested using Russian diplomatic facilities in the United States for the communications.

According to [Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/27/jared-kushner-hr-mcmaster-not-concerned-238885), National Security Advisor General McMaster responded to questions about the report by with this:

"Is the addition of $1 trillion to the national debt in 14 months under Trump cause for concern, or par for the course?","Today, I read an [article](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/15/donald-trump-adds-1-trillion-national-debt-14-mont/) from March 15, 2018 which stated that:

>President Trump has now amassed his first $1 trillion in debt, crossing that ignominious mark late last week — and analysts said it’s just a taste of what’s to come after the tax-cuts and spending spree of recent months.

To put this into [some context](http://www.businessinsider.com/national-debt-deficit-added-under-president-barack-obama-2017-1), under President Obama, the national debt grew:

>...by about $9 trillion, or an increase of 86&#37;.

(Of course, that was in 8 or so years.)

Given those numbers, is the debt increasing roughly $1 trillion in 14 months under President Trump exceptional or a bad sign, or is it relatively normal in our modern economy? Keeping in mind, of course, that President Obama inherited an economy that was seemingly in [bad shape](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/president-obama-the-legacy/eight-years-later-economy-president-obama-s-legacy-n703616) and President Trump inherited one in [arguably healthier condition](https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/opinion/columnists/ron-eachus/2017/02/21/obama-inherited-recession-trump-inherited-primed-pump/98201378/).

As a final aside, an [article](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/national-debt-trump/) from last year stated that the national debt had fallen by $102 billion since Trump's inauguration; much has changed since then, but it's still interesting to me in light of the above.

>We have checked these numbers and set them in context, and found that the national debt did indeed fall by $102 billion between 20 January and the end of July 2017. This decline is also historically remarkable, in both absolute and percentage terms.

Are the allegations in the articles of impeachment released today factually and legally supported?,"Today House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-impeachment-articles.html) the introduction of articles of ompeachment against President Donald Trump.

[Those articles of impeachment are available here.](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf) (PDF)

There are two articles.  I will briefly excerpt the core allegations from each:

* **Article I: Abuse of Power**

>Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponents, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engage in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process.  He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.

* **Article II: Obstruction of Congress**

>The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United States Presidential election. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various Executive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former officials.  

>In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, and assumed to himself the functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the ""sole Power of Impeachment"" vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.

The articles then proceed to describe the means by which the alleged actions were undertaken.  



*  Are the factual claims in the two articles of impeachment supported by evidence from testimony, documentation, or other sources?  Is there any countervailing evidence that shows them to be in doubt?

* Are the legal claims in the two articles of impeachment accurate? Do they comport with past cases of impeachment, criminal law, or other sources of law?

What have we learned from the plea agreement regarding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn?,"This morning Michael Flynn [plead guilty](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015126/download) to one count of lying to the FBI under 18 USC 1001.  

As part of the plea agreement, Flynn [has agreed to cooperate](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015121/download) with prosecutors in the Special Counsel's office.

[A report from ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-flynn-charged-making-false-statements-fbi-documents/story?id=50849354) indicates that Flynn ""is prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria.""

A few questions:

* How does this new information update our knowledge of the state of the allegations of collusion with the Russian government?

*   Does it contradict or prove false any prior statements from key players?  

* Are any crimes (by Flynn or others) other than those Flynn plead to today proven or more easily proved?

"If Trump colluded with the Russians and fired Comey to hide his collusion, is that a crime?","I want to be clear that I am not judging whether he did or did not do so.  Nor am I asking whether it would be an impeachable offense (i.e., a ""high crime or misdemeanor"").  I just want to know whether it would be a crime in the ordinary sense of the world.

[Here's an opinion piece](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/334100-opinion-a-special-counsel-is-the-wrong-way-to-uncover) by Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz arguing that this worst case scenario would not be a crime on the part of the President.  

On the other hand, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.)

Even if Lieu is a bit hasty in his judgment, is he at least right that Trump's actions, if they involve collusion with Russia and firing Comey to cover up such collusion, *could* be a crime in the ordinary sense of that word?  Or is Dershowitz right that the President has the right to fire the Director of the FBI and that even if he was covering up collusion he was not committing a crime?"

-Do people entering the US have the right to due process under the fifth amendment? If so, what form of due process?

-What power does the president have to deprive people of the rights they have upon entry to the US?

-If successful, would this lawsuit essentially void a major part of Trumps executive order, with the only remaining effect being to stop visas being issued to people from the mentioned countries?

Is it legal for Trump to appoint a new acting director of the CFPB without Senate confirmation?,"Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, resigned.  According to the law that created and defined the CFPB, if the director position is vacant, the acting director takes over until a new permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.  Cordray's deputy thus took over as acting director ... but Trump just named a new acting director.  He claims he has authority to do this under the vacancies act, which lets the president fill vacancies with temporary people until permanent ones are nominated and confirmed.  This doesn't seem to make sense to me, because the law says who the acting director is and thus there's no vacancy there, and the permanent director is a position he can only fill either with Senate confirmation or a recess appointment.  But Trump's office of legal counsel signed off on it and says it's legal.

What's the precedent here?  What's the law?  Is what Trump is trying to do, actually legal?

In Trump's Executive Order 13769 would Sunni Muslims in Iraq be considered a Religious Minority,"From the text:

>the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution,  provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual’s country of nationality.

Considering that Sunni Muslims are a religious minority according to [Iraq Religions 2014](http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Iraq_Religions_2014_lg.png) would this mean that potential refugee claims for Sunni Muslims would be prioritized over the Shiite majority.

Considering that ISIS is basically from the Sunni community, and those fighting ISIS with US and western backing are Shiites, this sounds like it would be exactly opposite what the government would intend."
"In Trump v. Hawaii (travel ban), the Supreme Court ruled the President's past statements should not be considered when reviewing that directive.

This very much reminded me of the Supreme Court decision last Summer in [Trump v. Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Hawaii), (commonly called the 'travel ban'), where the court sided with the President. 

The similarity comes from several lower court decisions that used Trump's [history of disparaging comments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/20/i-think-islam-hates-us-a-timeline-of-trumps-comments-about-islam-and-muslims/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8e683f19c5ae) to find decisions that [ruled against the President](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/us/travel-ban-blocked.html):

> The cases have presented the rare spectacle of a president’s own words undercutting the legal arguments of his administration. The government’s position is that the latest ban, like those before it, is not an attempt to prevent Muslims from entering the United States, but a bid to limit and control who enters from some of the world’s most dangerous countries.

> Judge Chuang quoted extensively from Mr. Trump’s statements and Twitter messages during the campaign and in office, including his demand as a candidate for “a complete and total shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” his calls for “a Muslim ban,” and a remark that because his statements had upset some people, he was “talking territory instead of Muslim.”

At the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the majority opinion that the President had ample statutory authority to make national security judgements when it came to immigration, and [addressed the comments cited by lower courts](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html):

> Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that Mr. Trump had made many statements concerning his desire to impose a “Muslim ban.” He recounted the president’s call for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” and he noted that the president has said that “Islam hates us” and has asserted that the United States was “having problems with Muslims coming into the country.”

> ...

> “The issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote. **“It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility.”**

> “In doing so,” he wrote, “we must consider not only the statements of a particular president, but also the authority of the presidency itself.”


----

I just have one question:
 
Does the Supreme Court's ruling in Trump v. Hawaii impact whether Trump's comments can be used effectively in litigation? As in, did the Supreme Court set precedent that would have weight in the lower courts about how Trump's personal comments can be used? Must Trump's comments be viewed separately from officially written and submitted presidential directives?

>Clearly disappointed with Mr. Trump’s positions on NATO, Russia, climate change and trade, Ms. Merkel said in Munich on Sunday that traditional alliances were no longer as steadfast as they once were and that Europe should pay more attention to its own interests “and really take our fate into our own hands.”

Daalder, a former United States envoy to NATO who is now the director of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. “Today, the United States is heading into a direction on key issues that seems diametrically opposite of where Europe is heading. Merkel’s comments are an acknowledgment of that new reality.”

In addition to the question in the title (Does Merkel's statement have precedent?), I have two other questions:

1) How do Germany and other European countries rely on the U.S.? 

2) Did this statement come suddenly or is it indicative of a trend?"
Why are politicians calling for a Congressional investigation to Trump/Russia connection before law enforcement has finished their investigation(s)?,"Recently, a number of politicians have called for an investigation into Trump's connection to Russia/the general influence of Russia on the elections:

* https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-02-15/u-s-spy-agencies-fbi-said-to-probe-trump-team-s-russia-calls

Thinking of many answers during the Hillary Clinton email hearings, can't law enforcement not comment on ongoing investigations during Congressional hearings?

Understanding that Congressional investigations are different than FBI/law enforcement investigations, what's the point of calling publicly for Congressional hearings when law enforcement hasn't finished their investigation yet?

Is this just political posturing or can Congressional investigations do things that law enforcement can't?"

[*Transcript of her remarks*](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/92419-0)

Given this, we are writing a brief overview of how the impeachment of the President works.  

Except where otherwise noted, I will be using [this Congressional Research Service report as my main source.](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44260.pdf)

#Constitutional Provisions

[The Constitution](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript) has three clauses describing the process of impeachment:

*Article II, Section 4*

>The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States,
shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason,
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

*Article I, Section 2*

>The House of Representatives ...
shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.

*Article I, Section 3*

>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for
that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the
United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be
convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

>Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from
Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or
Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be
liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to
Law.

#Process Overview

There are three essential steps:

1. The House votes (by a simple majority) to impeach the President.

2.  The Senate holds a trial, with the Chief Justice presiding.  

3.  The Senate votes on guilt, with 2/3 of Senators needing to vote ""guilty"" to convict.

#Process in the House of Representatives

The House has fairly broad discretion in what steps they take prior to voting on an impeachment resolution. 

[Pelosi indicated](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage) that the six standing committees of the House will forward impeachment related materials to the Judiciary Committee, which will consider articles of impeachment and, if approved, forward them to the House for consideration.

If the House decides to vote to impeach, they will need to draft specific articles of impeachment laying out the alleged acts for which the President is to be tried.

I am including as examples copies of the articles of impeachment against [Andrew Johnson](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm#7), [Bill Clinton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/articles122098.htm), and the articles adopted by the Judiciary Committee in respect to [Richard Nixon.](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/rnimparticles.htm)

After voting to approve articles of impeachment, the House will appoint ""managers"" who will act as the prosecution for the trial in the Senate.

#Process in the Senate

The Senate process is much more formalized, and structured as a trial.  The Senate adopted the current rules for impeachment trials [in 1986.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/impeach/senaterules.pdf)

The Senate can either conduct the trial before the full Senate, or before a committee, which would report its transcript to the full Senate.  The full Senate must vote on guilt or acquittal.  

If questions of evidence or procedure arose the presiding officer (the Chief Justice, for the trial of the President) would rule on them, but could be overridden by a vote of the Senate.

During the trial of Bill Clinton, [witnesses were deposed on videotape and the tape played to the Senate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton#Senate_trial)   Witnesses were heard live in the Senate during [Andrew Johnson's trial.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Andrew_Johnson#Trial)

After the trial the Senate would move into a closed session to deliberate, and then vote in open session.  Two thirds of senators voting must vote ""guilty"" on a count to convict.

#After a finding of guilty or not guilty

If the President were found guilty on any count of the impeachment, he would immediately be removed from office and the Vice President would immediately become President.  The Senate would then vote on whether to disqualify the ex-President from ""any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.""  The disqualification vote would be by a simple majority.

If the conduct which was the subject of the impeachment were also an ordinary crime, the ex-President could separately be tried for that crime.

If found not guilty, the President would continue in office."

"Nunes Memo: What is true, what is misleading? What is new, what was previously known? And what are potential consequences for the investigations into Russian election meddling?","Hi folks,

I'd like to break down the memo away from the major political subreddit megathreads a bit. [The memo can be read from this  Scribd link.](https://www.scribd.com/document/370599381/Nunes-Memo)

With all the speculation bouncing around prior to the release of the memo, it has become difficult to separate what was known vs speculated on regarding the memo and to what degree. I'd like to sort that out to some degree.

I'd also like to sort out where material presented in the memo changes the picture of the ongoing investigations, and where the memo may be misleading. Four possible starting points are: (1) the timing of surveillance on Carter Page, (2) the role of Bruce Ohr in the investigations, (3) the relationship to the Papadopoulos investigation, and (4) the necessity of the Steele dossier to the investigation. I'd love to discuss any other points as well.

Regarding (1), we've heard previously that [Page was under FISA surveillance since 2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576), but I'm not sure where that info comes from (the above has no corroboration in the link). Is the application mentioned in the memo a continuation or a new warrant? If a continuation, wouldn't that make the memo's assertions about the necessity of the Steele dossier misleading? If a new warrant, was he being surveilled earlier? And why was this a new warrant, not a continuation?

Regarding (2), Steele is said to have contacted DoJ through Bruce Ohr. Do we have any additional info on this contact? Was he Steele's only DoJ contact or were there others? What is Ohr's role now? How much do potential conflicts-of-interest regarding Ohr's wife and the DNC matter?

Regarding (3), the Papadopoulos info provided doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the memo's narrative. The memo states the investigation into Papadopoulos began in July 2016, but the FISA warrant for Page didn't begin until October. Is info on Papadopoulos in the dossier, and was the dossier used to begin that investigation? I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here; it seems to me to be another chance to bring up Strzok's name more than anything else, but I'm open to discussion.

Regarding (4), do we have corroboration that McCabe stated the investigation into Page required the dossier information? If true, that might make the FISA warrant originally issud questionable, [or it might not](https://lawfareblog.com/dubious-legal-claim-behind-releasethememo) as discussed in this lawfareblog post from before the public release of the memo. Essentially, the post states that bias in the evidence used to obtain the warrant is not enough to stop the warrant from being issued if the biased information is precise and from a reliable source.

That's just to get a discussion started - I'm hoping to break down the memo some more and draw connections to info we had before the release of the memo as well. "
What are the pros and cons of privatizing Air Traffic Control in the United States?,"The latest announcement is that Trump wants to start [privatizing air traffic control](http://www.npr.org/2017/06/05/531574945/trump-announces-plan-to-privatize-air-traffic-control?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=politics&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews).

For reference, it appears that Canada has privatized their air traffic control systems and Trump is using their success as a guideline. 

So I have 3 questions:

1. What are the pros

2. What are the cons

3. What has been the result of Canada privatizing their system, and is it valid to use them as a comparison?"
The Trump Administration’s State Department has directed EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland to not appear for a voluntary scheduled interview before the House Joint Committee with regard to his role in the Trump/Ukraine story. Is the White House/State Dept empowered to prevent Sondland’s testimony?,"One source, of many; https://www.npr.org/2019/10/08/768200323/trump-administration-blocks-ambassadors-testimony-a-key-witness-in-ukraine-scand?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Here’s the statement from Sondland’s legal council, from that article: 

> **""Early this morning, the U.S. Department of State directed Ambassador Gordon Sondland not to appear today for his scheduled transcribed interview before the U.S. House of Representatives Joint Committee,""** the law firm representing Sondland said in a statement. **""Ambassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the Committee's questions on an expedited basis. As the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the Department's direction.""**

Is this a valid explanation? Must an Ambassador to the United States comply with any order or direction the State Department gives them? Is there anywhere the State Dept’s powers are enumerated in this regard? 

Would ordering a subpoena have made the process significantly less “expedited”? What benefit is there to not subpoenaing someone in a high-profile case like this? 

Also;

> House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Tuesday morning that he considers the blocking of Sondland's testimony and release of documents that Democrats are seeking to be ""additional strong evidence of obstruction of the constitutional functions of Congress.""

If Sondland’s attorneys had simply *not checked their voicemail*, would Sondland have been allowed to testify? How does this work, legally speaking? Does a voicemail constitute a direction? And who is empowered to make such a direction in the first place in the State Department?"
"What are the legal/ethical limits on the President of the U.S. disclosing highly confidential information to foreign officials, and are there any historical examples of presidents doing so? If so, what is the protocol?","In light of the recent story of Trump disclosing highly confidential intel to the Russian officials in their Oval Office meeting last week ([The Washington Post's original story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.fc09aca19eb5); [CNN's coverage] (http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/politics/trump-russia-classified-information/index.html); [The New York Time's coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/us/politics/trump-russia-classified-information-isis.html); [The Atlantic's coverage](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/trump-classified-information/526797/)),

I'm wondering:

1) what the legal and ethical framework is surrounding the disclosure of highly confidential information by the president (and the consequences of breaking those limits);

2) whether there are other examples of Presidents unilaterally disclosing such information in conversation with foreign officials; and

3) and whether there is usually a specific protocol that is followed when disclosing such information to foreign officials."
"Reports suggest that police use of lethal force against minorities in the U.S. is higher than their white counterpart; and so is the rate of lethal force when compared to police forces in other countries. What policies, both federal and local, have been pursued to try and reduce this number?","T[his article by the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/opinion/minneapolis-police-brutality.html) goes deep into the issue of how the use of lethal force by the police in the U.S. still persists, particularly against minorities.

&#x200B;

While the conclusion is still being examined, [there is evidence that suggests that rates of use of lethal force by the police in the U.S. are much higher than the rest of the world](https://theconversation.com/why-do-american-cops-kill-so-many-compared-to-european-cops-49696) and [the number of incidents where the ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries)[police force was involved is significantly larger in America](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/09/the-counted-police-killings-us-vs-other-countries) than in the rest of the world

&#x200B;

One possible change that was discussed was [when Obama called for changes in policing in 2015](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/politics/obama-calls-for-changes-in-policing-after-task-force-report.html).

However, the rate of police lethal force against minorities is still very prevalent as quoted in [this study](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793.short) ""for young men of color, police use of force is among the leading causes of death"" and the persistent prevalence of use of lethal force by the police against minorities is claimed to be [racially motivated](https://www.law.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Paper-Obasogie.pdf). In contrast, [according to this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6080222/) that examined police lethal force from 2009 to 2012, a large quantity of deaths by lethal force has occurred and at least 50% of the victims were white.

&#x200B;

What other policies, local and federal, have been pursued? How successful have they been?

 What policy reasons have been given as to why lethal force from police is so prevalent in the U.S. compared to other countries?"

The source is the *New York Times* story [""Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/us/politics/trump-russia-kushner-manafort.html) This story was also independently confirmed by [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-jr-jared-kushner-met-russian-lawyer/story?id=48525401)

Some details:

- The meeting took place at Trump Tower.

- The meeting was confirmed by representatives of Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner.

- The lawyer they met with:

>The Russian lawyer invited to the Trump Tower meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is best known for mounting a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers. The law so enraged Mr. Putin that he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children.

- The lawyer's ties:

>Ms. Veselnitskaya was formerly married to a former deputy transportation minister of the Moscow region, and her clients include state-owned businesses and a senior government official’s son, whose company was under investigation in the United States at the time of the meeting. Her activities and associations had previously drawn the attention of the F.B.I., according to a former senior law enforcement official.

- The topic of discussion:

>In his statement, Donald Trump Jr. said: 'It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.' He added: 'I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand.'”
 
- The nature of the meeting's disclosure: 

>The Trump Tower meeting was not disclosed to government officials until recently, when Mr. Kushner, who is also a senior White House aide, filed a revised version of a form required to obtain a security clearance."" 

My questions are:

1) Is there any precedent for such a meeting? Are there any indications that this meeting is usual or unusual?

2) Does the meeting violate any law?

3) *Does the new revelation about the possible motivation for the meeting impact its legality?*"
"Nancy Peolsi and Chuck Schumer are calling for Labor Secretary Acosta to resign over how he handled the Jeffery Epstein case when he was a Federal prosecutor in Florida. How is Acosta responsible for providing lenient punishment, and was punishment lax compared to others convicted of the same crime?","[Jeffery Epstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein) is a wealthy financier who in 2008 was convinced on a single state charge of ""soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14."" [Some sources cite two charges]

His 2008 deal signed by current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta [included certain benefits](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article219494920.html):

> ...the multimillionaire was assigned to a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade, where he was able to hire his own security detail. Even then, he didn’t spend much time in a cell. He was allowed to go to his downtown West Palm Beach office for work release, up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, records show. 

Additionally, the Miami Herald reports Acosta's non-prosecution agreement ""essentially shut down"" an ongoing FBI probe into linked crimes and victims, may have granted immunity to potential co-conspirators that were left unnamed, and that Acosta may also have violated Federal law when he [failed to notify](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html) victims of Epstein of this deal:

> Not only would Epstein serve just 13 months in the county jail, but the deal — called a non-prosecution agreement — essentially shut down an ongoing FBI probe into whether there were more victims and other powerful people who took part in Epstein’s sex crimes, according to a Miami Herald examination of thousands of emails, court documents and FBI records.

> The pact required Epstein to plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court. Epstein and four of his accomplices named in the agreement received immunity from all federal criminal charges. But even more unusual, the deal included wording that granted immunity to “any potential co-conspirators’’ who were also involved in Epstein’s crimes. These accomplices or participants were not identified in the agreement, leaving it open to interpretation whether it possibly referred to other influential people who were having sex with underage girls at Epstein’s various homes or on his plane.

> As part of the arrangement, Acosta agreed, despite a federal law to the contrary, that the deal would be kept from the victims. As a result, the non-prosecution agreement was sealed until after it was approved by the judge, thereby averting any chance that the girls — or anyone else — might show up in court and try to derail it.

There were [36 victims cited](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48925932) in court documents.

---

This 2008 deal by Acosta has come under scrutiny because of [new charges against Epstein](https://www.apnews.com/f995d90cbfd943169f74a0dbb3b1eadc). 

Acosta has defended the deal as appropriate (from Source 3):

> “At the end of the day, based on the evidence, professionals within a prosecutor’s office decided that a plea that guarantees someone goes to jail, that guarantees he register [as a sex offender] generally and guarantees other outcomes, is a good thing,’’ Acosta said of his decision to not prosecute Epstein federally.

Speaker Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer are [calling on Labor Secretary Acosta to step down](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/alex-acosta-jeffrey-epstein.html) because of his handling of the Epstein case.

---

I have a few questions on this topic:

1) What authority did Alexander Acosta have to make the punishment against Jeffery Epstein more severe? How much responsibility on deciding the sentencing rests with Acosta?

2) Was Jeffery Epstein's punishment on ""soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14"" in the state of Florida unusual? In terms of time served, fines, sex registration, and prison/jail treatment, what evidence is there that Epstein was given preferential treatment?

3) Several prosecutors have stated Acosta's deal was unusual in terms of how Epstein was treated, but also how it affected an FBI probe and granted immunity to potential co-conspirators. Is there anything else unusual about the non-prosecution agreement or Acosta's handling of the Epstein case overall?"

While many cities have 'no right turn on red light' signs at busy intersections, New York City is unique in that the default for all five boroughs is you can't make a right turn at a red traffic light (source 3).

1: Why is NYC unique in having this 'no right turn on red traffic light' rule?

2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of by default not allowing right turns at red traffic lights throughout the five boroughs?

So...

- What are the established procedures for what happens next ?

- Who has authority to limit information/make redactions. Can the president?

- What can previous investigations tell is about how this report will play out?

- is Rosenstein's advice codified somewhere in official policy?

- Does this mean [Bijan Kian](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mike-flynn-business-partner-bijan-kian-now-subject-mueller-probe-n823366) won't be indicted by the special counsel's office or  that the Special Prosecutors office won't indicte anyone else?

- What about the [mystery company](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/supreme-court-mystery-grand-jury-subpoena-mueller/index.html) that may appeal to the supreme court?

- Is this actually the end of the Mueller Investigation or will the office continue to operate to some degree beyond wrapping up trials?

- What procedure or precedent can compel that the report be made [""sight unseen""](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sight%20unseen) to promote transparency and bipartisanship in the publication of information?

####[Special Counsel Authorizing Document and Scope](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3726408-Rosenstein-letter-appointing-Mueller-special.html)

The Special Counsel is authorized to conduct the investigation confinned by then-FBI Director James Corney in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including: 

(i) any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals 
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump; and 

(ii) any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation; and 

(iii) any other matters within the scope of 28 C.F.R. § 600.4(a)."
The Trump administration says Comey could face criminal charges. Is there currently any evidence that Comey has broken the law?,"The Trump administration has indicated that former FBI director James Comey could face criminal charges as part of William Barr's investigation into the origins of the Mueller report.

[President Trump accused Comey](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-turns-full-force-government-perceived-political-enemies-n1010096), among others, of treason on the 25th.

> He reiterated Thursday that he believes he is the victim of a long-running effort that meant to stop him from winning in 2016, delegitimize his presidency and remove him from office either through impeachment or by Democrats damaging him enough with investigations that he can't be re-elected.

> He has charged that some of his adversaries are guilty of treason, and he was asked Thursday to provide the names of people who should be held accountable for a crime punishable by death.

> Trump answered with a list of names: McCabe, Comey, former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former Justice Department official Lisa Page.

[Sarah Sanders says](https://thinkprogress.org/donald-trump-sarah-huckabee-sanders-meet-the-press-william-barr-james-comey-82d497dd766d/) President Trump expects AG Barr to hold ""the people that were responsible"" accountable.

> During an interview on NBC’s Meet The Press on Sunday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Attorney General William Barr will decide whether former FBI director James Comey could face criminal charges from Trump’s Justice Department.

> “We certainly expect the people that were responsible and that were part of this unprecedented obstruction and corruption at the FBI, those people should certainly be held responsible and be held accountable,” added Sanders. “And the president expects that to take place.”

- Is there currently any evidence that Comey has broken the law?
- Are there any historical examples of an FBI employee being charged for the way/process an investigation was opened?
- How do historical cases of treason charges compare to this situation?

[My impression that opposition research is commonplace these days](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-do-politicians-gather-opposition-research-on-other-candidates/) — how is the Trump dossier different?"
"The US National debt is $22 trillion, but critics say focusing on this number misses other debt the Federal government is actually an underwriter for, like State debt, pensions, social security payouts and more. What debt outside of US treasury bonds is the Federal reserve formally on the hook for?","The current US national debt is [around $22 trillion](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/13/694199256/u-s-national-debt-hits-22-trillion-a-new-record-thats-predicted-to-fall).

[Some](https://www.businessinsider.com/social-security-and-medicare-could-add-trillions-to-the-national-debt-2018-7) investors [argue](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamstrauss/2018/07/12/how-to-invest-in-an-era-of-100-trillion-financial-obligations-part-i/#40b4deb67ccb) this number [does not reflect](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/09/real-us-debt-levels-could-be-a-shocking-2000percent-of-gdp-report-suggests.html) the true debt obligations of the United States.

Critics argue money like [$3.1 in individual state debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SLGSDODNS) should be considered a Federal obligation. There are also arguments to include *future liabilities*, like Social Security, which by law cannot add to the deficit, but for which is expected by 2034 to require Congress to make up any shortfall through Federal spending, unless another solution is drafted [Source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-socialsecurity/social-security-and-the-u-s-deficit-separating-fact-from-fiction-idUSKCN1N64GR).

---

This $22 trillion number is important because it's widely used to inform the public about the total debt liabilities of the Federal government.

It's also used in other metrics and indexes of government debt obligations, like the [Debt-to-GDP Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp), which is used by investors as one measure of the credit worthiness of a government.

---

I have a couple questions on this topic:

1. What additional debt obligations, if any, is the Federal government formally on the hook for outside of the ~$22 trillion national debt? For example, is there any clarity on whether future Social Security payments are a certain Federal financial obligation?

2. Are these potential liabilities formally used in rating the security of US treasury bonds?"

Obama just moved to protect Planned Parenthood funding permanently through Title X; my question is what are the mechanisms of government by which the President can do that?,"See here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-planned-parenthood_us_57d2c654e4b06a74c9f42f46

Obama apparently added a new rule to Title X that says that states cannot withhold federal family planning money for any reason other than the provider’s ""ability to deliver services to program beneficiaries in an effective manner.""

Wikipedia says Title X is a public law, but I'm not really sure what that entails. What does it mean for the President to add a new rule to a public law? Does anyone have to approve this? Articles I've read about it seem to imply that Congress and states will not have a say in it.

I'm simply looking for an explanation of the mechanisms of government involved in doing something like this, and specifically around the powers of the Executive branch as it relates to modifying laws.

I am not really looking for a discussion of the arguments for or against this specific change, but do as you will."
How much evidence is there linking Saudi funding for conservative Muslim schools and terrorist attacks against western countries?,"Saudi Arabia may have spent more than [$100 billion](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-yousaf-butt-/saudi-wahhabism-islam-terrorism_b_6501916.html) promoting Wahabism throughout the Islamic world. Saudi textbooks promoting an Wahabist worldview were even [used in the Islamic state](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html) before they could write their own (though of course Saudi Arabia explicitly condemns the Islamic State). And of course Osama bin Laden was from a wealthy Saudi family.

So at least on a superficial level it seems like Saudi Arabia has strong connections to modern Islamic extremism, but I don't know if that is the whole story. How exactly is Saudi money spent internationally used? Are there consistent, provable ties to Saudi-funded mosques and terrorists? What is there online presence like--with so many terrorist attacks coming from homegrown ""self-radicalized"" Muslims living or born in the west, are they connecting somehow to Wahabist religious teachings online, or are online radical communities completely unrelated to the Saudis?"
"re: ""Has there actually been a statistically meaningful increase in hate-crimes since Trump was elected?""","[This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5wrgv4/has_there_actually_been_a_statistically/) was posted two years ago by u/[SkincareQuestions10](https://www.reddit.com/user/SkincareQuestions10).

What are the implications of repealing the johnson amendment.,"President trump suggested he would do away with the Johnson Amendment. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-destroy-johnson-amendment-religious-freedom-separation-church-state-a7559421.html

I am wondering two things:  
What are examples of things that a church- such as ""first baptist church of santaville alabama"" can already do legally today as it relates to politics and AFTER the repeal, what are some things that they could do?  (Before and after)

To date, Ive heard countless sermons on the evils of abortion (political policy implications) gambling, alcohol, gay marriage, etc.  All things which depending on a persons religious view are all consistent with religion, etc. and also have direct policy implications.

I would appreciate a few clear, relateable examples before and after. 

Would this be an example of what happens if it is repealed? ""pastor joe can now say ""vote for Bush"" and can write a check from ""first baptist church"" to ""George Bush Campaign fund""?

 Where as before the repeal of the amendment joe could only say ""God hates abortion, gay marriage, and we need people in office who agree""?

"What is birthright citizenship, what are the pros and cons to birthright citizenship, and what would the constitutionality be for an executive order to end birthright citizenship? (More in text)","Recently, President Trump announced that he would sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship (https://www.axios.com/trump-birthright-citizenship-executive-order-0cf4285a-16c6-48f2-a933-bd71fd72ea82.html)

Trump says that the purpose of the executive order is to end the practice of anchor babies: babies who are born on US soil to non-US citizens/illegal aliens but are US citizens because they were born inside the US. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_baby)

Opponents argue that the executive order would violate the Section 1 of 14th Amendment of the United States, which states that ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution).

So here are my questions:

1. What is Birthright citizenship?

2. What are the pros and cons to birthright citizenship?

2b. What does the 14th Amendment say/the Supreme Court ruled in regards to birthright citizenship or children born by non-US citizens?

3. What would be the constitutionality (What is consitutional/unconstitutional) to a law or executive order ending birthright citizenship?

3b. Does the President have the authority to make such a decision?"

"Has ISIS, in the past, claimed responsibility for mass murder attacks they had no connection to?","The context of this question is the deadly shooting Las Vegas, in which case [ISIS claimed responsibility] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lasvegas-shooting-islamic-state/islamic-state-claims-las-vegas-shooting-u-s-officials-skeptical-idUSKCN1C71SP), and [US officials didn't find any connection] (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lasvegas-shooting/las-vegas-police-look-for-motive-in-deadliest-mass-shooting-in-modern-u-s-history-idUSKCN1C70FU).

A popular reaction to ISIS claims, is that they often take responsibility for incidents they have no connection to. It is certainly a relevant question to ask if they took responsibility in the past for actions they had no connection to. I would like to see some examples of that.

For example the Mateen attack, he dedicated the attack to various terrorist groups, including ISIS. [In fact he did pledge his allegiance to ISIS.] (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/13/us/orlando-omar-mateen-isis.html)

For me, I am more curious about examples of non Islamic terrorism, and I don't find it as important if the individual isn't part of an organization beyond being motivated by ISIS calls for violence. Nevertheless, someone else might approach this differently and you can show examples of ISIS claiming responsibility for any sort of Islamic terrorism too.

This question doesn't prove anything because the credibility of a mass murdering terrorist group is always in doubt, but it is still a relevant issue to examine, if nothing else, on a factual basis."
"What is the significance of President Trump's pardon of Arpaio, and have pardons been used similarly by previous presidents?","Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who'd recently been convicted of contempt of court, was pardoned by [POTUS](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/us/politics/joe-arpaio-trump-pardon-sheriff-arizona.html?mcubz=0). From the same article, Joe Arpaio is known to put aggressive efforts to track down undocumented immigrants. 

The [Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-pardon-arpaio/537729/) puts pardon statement this way: 

> “Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration,” the White House said in a statement. “Sheriff Joe Arpaio is now eighty-five years old, and after more than fifty years of honorable service to our Nation, he is [a] worthy candidate for a Presidential pardon.”

The president highlights Arpaio's old age and his service to Arizona in his [tweet](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/901263061511794688).

Has socialism and the welfare state helped or harmed Scandinavia?,"There is a debate in the USA about whether or not we should have a larger welfare state that provides services like ""Medicare for all"" or tuition free college. Scandinavia is often brought up as an example showing that ""social democracy"" or a ""welfare state"" is a good or ideal system, with these countries having achieved high levels of equality, low levels of poverty, and good outcomes in terms of education, health, and happiness (source: http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/17/politics/bernie-sanders-2016-denmark-democratic-socialism/index.html). 

There are several counter arguments that I have heard in opposition to expanding the welfare state: 
1. The success these countries have experienced was due to their policies 50+ years ago when they had a smaller welfare state and low taxes and as a result experienced rapid growth
2. The welfare state has led to economic stagnation and high levels of national debt in these countries. 
3. The people in these countries have strong Protestant values of hard work and honesty and this is the true source of their success.

I've tried searching for a neutral analysis of the issue, but every article I've seen argues that the socialist policies are either wonderful or terrible (examples: https://www.thenation.com/article/after-i-lived-in-norway-america-felt-backward-heres-why/ and https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/bernie-sanders-nordic-countries/473385/ vs. http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438331/nordic-democratic-socialist-model-exposing-lefts-myth). What evidence supports each view? Is there an objective way of determining whether more socialist or more libertarian (perhaps what Europeans call neo-liberal?) policies have been the most beneficial?"
Is there any precedent for the Executive Branch not enforcing sanctions (or any other passed legislation)?,"The deadline for implementing sanctions against Russia has passed. The White House has said that [it will not implement said sanctions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/rich-russians-still-waiting-to-exhale/2018/01/29/7df459ca-052a-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html). This is despite Congress passing the bill, and the President signing it.

* Is there anything in this particular law that allows the executive branch to exercise discretion?
* If there is no legal justification for the aforementioned act of not implementing, is the recourse to challenge their refusal in the courts, or some other measure?"

Are Donald Trump's continued ties with business and apparent conflicts of interest unprecedented?,"I have seen a lot of criticism of Donald Trump over his continued involvement in business. He is not removing himself from Trump Organization as much as many would like, and he also says he will keep his role as executive producer of celebrity apprentice. Many say this creates a conflict of interest. I'm inclined to agree, but it also raises another question. Is Donald Trump uniquely conflicted in this area, or have any past presidents also kept similar ties with businesses while president or had similar conflicts of interest?

"META: On the Meaning of ""Neutral""","With the American election season heating up, NeutralPolitics has seen continual growth. As posts and comments have come flooding in, mods have noticed an increasing number of user reports with just two words: ""not neutral"".

We appreciate reports on posts that don't meet our [guidelines'](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) requirement to be ""framed in a neutral way,"" but it's important to understand that comments have no neutrality requirement.

In 2011, NeutralPolitics was founded with the goal of creating a space for logical, respectful and evidence-based political discussion. Our [Original FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/pteu5/meta_rneutralpolitics_frequently_asked_questions/) spells out how neutrality plays into that:
>**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

>No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. **We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic.** Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

So, it's the environment that's neutral, not the comments themselves.

**Here's how some of our mods have put it:**

* /u/cassisback: ""Neutral means evidence based positions, and willingness to discard current positions in light of new evidence.""

* /u/lolmonger: ""I tend to think of ""Neutral"" as meaning a position that has some kind of logical grounding and is communicated along with how the conclusion was made and acknowledges it isn't the final word, necessarily, and is open to new information changing it.""

* /u/lulfas: ""Perspective, sources, facts. I had a professor that said 'if you can't argue both sides of a topic, you don't know enough about it to speak in public'. I attempt to live that on NeutralPolitics.""

* /u/PavementBlues: ""The phrase that I use to briefly describe a neutral approach is that it is one in which we seek to find out whether our opinions are correct rather than prove that they are correct.""

Additionally, both the mod team and the userbase [have had discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/15d8fc/is_neutral_the_same_as_moderate/) on whether ""neutral means moderate"" and the answer has been a resounding ""no"".

We don't advocate for a ""moderate"" or ""centrist"" perspective. You can be a progressive, a monarchist, an anarcho-liberal, a Burkean, a syndicalist or a classical reactionary. **As long as you're willing to have a polite, good-faith, evidence-based discussion with the other users and are open to new viewpoints in light of new evidence**, we're glad to have you here."

The NFL's new policy on protests during the national anthem. Is it legal? Is it appropriate? Are there better alternatives?,"Silent political protests while the national anthem is being played prior to US football games [has been a topic of discussion for the last couple years.](https://www.sbnation.com/2018/5/25/17391410/nfl-anthem-policy-timeline-colin-kaepernick) Some [support](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/throngs-declare-their-support-for-colin-kaepernick-outside-nfl-headquarters_us_599e8c26e4b06d67e3353f8d) the protests, while others have reacted negatively, including comments up to the level of the [US president](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912664574461120512?lang=en).

The National Football League (NFL) recently issued [new rules regarding athlete behavior during the national anthem,](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/23582533/nfl-owners-approve-new-national-anthem-policy) specifically requiring present athletes to stand while it's being played, but allowing those who object to remain in the locker room until the anthem concludes. There are fines associated with violations of these rules.

Political protest is a [Constitutionally guaranteed right in the US,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) but many [legal experts support the view](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/25/16360580/nfl-donald-trump-national-anthem-protest) that the NFL, as a private organization, may set its own workplace rules, even if they limit expression. 

On the other hand, there are some interesting counterarguments.

> Last month, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled in *Beckman v. Chicago Bear Football Club* that a Green Bay Packers fan [may proceed with his First Amendment lawsuit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcedelman/2018/05/02/recent-court-decision-makes-it-riskier-for-nfl-teams-to-punish-protesting-players/#354cee8948d8) against the Chicago Bears organization after the Bears refused to allow him to attend an on-field event while dressed in Packers clothing. The court noted that the fan may have a right to ""free speech"" within Soldier Field based on an operating agreement that gave both the Chicago Bears football club and the Chicago Park District shared control over speech in the **publicly-funded football stadium.** (emphasis added)

[Many NFL stadiums are publicly funded.](https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/nfl-new-stadiums-public-funding-how-much-atlanta-san-diego-minnesota-los-angeles-033116)

And Benjamin Sachs, a Harvard professor of labor and industry, [calls the ban ""flatly illegal""](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/25/17394422/nfl-knee-kneeling-labor-law-kaepernick-free-speech-protest-owners) on a number of different grounds, including the league's failure to discuss the new rules with the player's union before changing the terms of employment, the restriction it imposes on the employees' right to engage in a collective action, and the limitations it introduces on protected free speech, based on either State constitutions, or Federally, because of the involvement of the US President in the dispute.

So, the first question is, based on the above, whether the NFL's new policy is legal.

Moving beyond that, is the ban an appropriate measure for the league to take? President Trump expressed his support for the rule and strongly implied that it didn't go far enough:

> I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or
you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.

Others argue that in the US, [the act of protest itself is patriotic.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-anthem-nfl-protest-patriotism-20180524-story.html) Is there room for dissent over policy at a public event put on by a private organization?

And finally, if the NFL's new policy isn't the right one, what would be better? Have alternative approaches been proposed that would allow the league to respond to the desires of its fans while also honoring the laws and traditions of the country?

What are the pros and cons of taxing capital gains as ordinary income?,"A [capital gain](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capital%20gain) is ""the increase in value of an asset (such as stock or real estate) between the time it is bought and the time it is sold.""

Is it true or false that immigrants do jobs most Americans won't?,"I read a [paper](https://cis.org/Are-There-Really-Jobs-Americans-Wont-Do) from 2013 today which argues that ""there really are no jobs that Americans won't do"":

>This analysis tests the often-made argument that immigrants do only jobs Americans don't want. If the argument is correct, there should be occupations comprised entirely or almost entirely of immigrants (legal and illegal). But Census Bureau data collected from 2009 to 2011, which allows for detailed analysis of all 472 separate occupations, shows that there were only a handful of majority-immigrant occupations. Thus, there really are no jobs that Americans won't do. Further, we estimated the share of occupations that are comprised of illegal immigrants, and found that there are no occupations in which the majority of workers are illegally in the country.

I have often heard the contention that immigrants do jobs Americans won't, but some articles, such as the aforementioned one quoted in the previous paragraph, say that this is largely a myth, similar to how the notion that ""immigrants *take* our jobs"" is [said by some](http://www.seiu.org/cards/the-8-worst-myths-about-immigration) to be a myth.

The pieces linked below, however, seem to show that, perhaps, there is some truth to the idea that Americans won't do certain jobs (although, these articles are generally specific to California and Georgia):

[California Crops Rot as Immigration Crackdown Creates Farmworker Shortage](http://fortune.com/2017/08/08/immigration-worker-shortage-rotting-crops/)

**Finally:**

Following the above, there are roughly two perspectives on this issue. The first is that there is an idea that [immigration potentially costs Americans jobs](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/trump-clinton-immigration-economy-unemployment-jobs-214216), and what we have been seeing is [the response](https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-administration-cracks-down-on-parents-entering-country-illegally-with-their-children/).  The wild card in this argument, based on the available evidence, is whether Americans are willing to do these jobs at the wages paid or offered, or at all.

Brad Goehring, a fourth-generation farmer, [tested](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farms-immigration/) the hypothesis of whether a higher agricultural wage would get Americans to do these jobs. Even that, at least in his case, was not wholly sufficient to accomplish such:

>In the last five years, he has advertised in local newspapers and accepted more than a dozen unemployed applicants from the state’s job agency. Even when the average rate on his fields was $20 an hour, the U.S.-born workers lost interest, fast.

How unusual are the Russian Government activities described in the criminal indictment brought today by Robert Mueller?,"Today, US Special Counsel Robert Mueller [indicted](https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download) 12 named officers of the Russian government's [Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Intelligence_Directorate) for hacking into the emails and servers of the Clinton campaign, Democratic National Committee, and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

 The indictment charges that the named defendants used spearphishing emails to obtain passwords from various DNCC and campaign officials and then in some cased leveraged access gained from those passwords to attack servers, and that GRU malware persisted on DNC servers throughout most of the 2016 campaign.

The GRU then is charged to have passed the information to the public through the identites of DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 both of which were controlled by them.  They also passed information through an organization which is identified as ""organization 1"" but which press reports [indicate is Wikileaks.](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/13/17569030/mueller-indictments-russia-hackers-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton-democratic-national-convention)

"What happens now with the ""Travel Ban""?","Today, [SCOTUS ruled 5-4 that the Trump has constitutional authority to implement his ""Travel Ban""](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/17-965_h315.pdf).

So my questions are pretty simple: What happens now?

If we read the text of the [current ""Travel Ban""](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states-2/), which was issued in March of 2017, there are several key things I'd like to inquire about.

The first is the statement that such a travel ban will last only 90-days:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Does the 90-day period begin now, or how does that work? Also, is it enforced by law or is the 90-day window an arbitrary number that has no legal bearing?

Lastly, there are several mentions of stipulating factors for this proclamation, specifically surrounding our (The United States) ""review"" of several processes. Examples:

> Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, **while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review**, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries — each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States — would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

> Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP **pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees.** Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.

Since these statements, to me, imply that this ban will continue as long as our processes are under review, is there anything that legally obligates the government to conduct an actual review of their processes *and finish it*, or could they theoretically conduct a review for four years?"
Brexit Megathread,"#The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union.

---

Highlights:

* The UK has voted to leave the EU, with voters in England outside of London being the bulk of the Leave vote.  Wales was very closely split with a slight lead for Leave.  Northern Ireland was also close with a slight lead for Remain.  Scotland was strongly for Remain.

* Global markets have been shocked by the news, and stocks are down markedly around the globe.  The British pound has had its single largest fall in at least the past four decades and is at levels not seen since 1985.

* The vote begins a negotiation period between the United Kingdom and the European Union over the terms of departure which may last up to two years.  The UK may seek to retain access to the common market, but it is not assured that can happen.

* Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to resign his office by October.  He had been a vocal proponent of ""Remain"" but had called the referendum based on a campaign promise to do so.

* There are substantial calls for Scotland and possibly Northern Ireland to consider referenda on leaving the United Kingdom.  Scotland recently voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014 by about a 10 point margin in favour of staying in the UK.

Against infection and the hand of war,

This happy breed of men, this little world,

This precious stone set in the silver sea,

Which serves it in the office of a wall,

Or as a moat defensive to a house,

Against the envy of less happier lands,

Do citizens from countries with universal health care systems (i.e. Canada) often come to the US for medical procedures to avoid long lines and rationing of services?,"When debating about the implementation of a universal health care system in the US, Canadians coming to the US for medical procedures is often a point made by those opposed to the idea. Are there any recent studies to back up either side of this argument?


Health Affairs study on [Canadians crossing the border for health care](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/21/3/19.full):



Between 1994-1998, this study collected data from ambulatory care services in Michigan, New York State, and Washington State. The study found that “almost 40 percent of the facilities we surveyed reported treating no Canadians, while an additional 40 percent had seen fewer than ten patients.”

Health Affairs study on [access to care and cost of services](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2010/11/18/hlthaff.2010.0862.full.html):



This study from 2010 surveyed 11 countries with widely varying health care systems.

“Switzerland stands out for rapid access: 93 percent of the Swiss respondents had received a same- or next-day appointment the last time they were sick. Swiss adults, along with German and US adults, were more likely than adults in the other countries to report quick access to specialists.”

“In contrast, one-fourth or more of Canadian, Swedish, and Norwegian adults reported having to wait six days or more to see a doctor or nurse when sick.”

I could not find a study that was conclusive on the rationing of services in different countries.

Are immigrants in US detention centers free to return to their country of origin?,"Conditions are very poor in U.S. immigration detention centers, and have [been stretching back for many years](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/children-detention-center-trump/).  For example, this is a [page of advice for those entering such a facility.](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/living-conditions-immigration-detention-centers.html)

Three questions:

1. Are these holding facilities just for people whose immigration is being processed?  
2. Would people in these centers be free to return home if they chose to give up on trying to enter the US?  
3.  What is preventing us from improving our throughput for processing immigrants to keep up with demand?"
What is the end-game of Oregon politicians denying quorum?,"So the long and short is that several Oregon lawmakers have decided to abandon the state capital in order to avoid allowing a quorum on a climate change bill: [https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/06/oregon-senate-republicans-walkout-could-kill-hundreds-of-bills.html](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/06/oregon-senate-republicans-walkout-could-kill-hundreds-of-bills.html)

&#x200B;

Without a quorum they cannot hold any votes, and their constitution mandates all bills not passed by June 30 to be considered dead. They would need to reintroduce any legislation and get it approved all over again.

In this particular example, it's extra spicy because at least one lawmaker seems to have insinuated they will kill those attempting to return them by force, and several militia groups have made [similar threats](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/oregon-statehouse-shut-down-after-lawmakers-team-up-with-right-wing-militias/ar-AADh0mB?ocid=spartanntp).

&#x200B;

This raises several questions for me:

* Are these walkouts legal? Could these lawmakers be charged even if they return voluntarily?
* As a follow-up to that: can these lawmakers be dismissed from their posts without a vote? If not, are there supposed to be any measures in place to prevent these actions? Seems like it would be very easy and very exploitable to just wait until shortly before this deadline every session and then just stage a walkout to deny the majority, especially if votes are required to remove you and those take time to arrange. What solutions have other states or democracies found to this kind of problem?

In regards to the threats:

* Who is normally responsible for returning these lawmakers to do their jobs?
* If threats are escalated or violence is begun, is this considered a purely domestic matter to Oregon and their police are the ones to resolve, or could the National Guard or federal armed forces become involved? I suppose the FBI is also possible since some of them appear to have crossed state lines.
* &#x200B;

Do the changing sentencing positions of the US government in the Roger Stone case constitute a violation of US law or DoJ policy?,"Yesterday the Department of Justice filed a [sentencing memorandum](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.279.0_2.pdf) for Roger Stone, who had provided information from WikiLeaks to the Trump campaign during 2016.  Stone was convicted in November 2019 by a jury of obstructing a Congressional investigation, making false statements to Congress, and witness tampering.

In that sentencing memorandum, the DoJ sought a sentence within the range they calculated the US Sentencing Guidelines to suggest of 87 to 108 months (7-9 years).

Stone's attorneys [disputed](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.280.0.pdf) the guidelines calculation made by the government, and believe the guidelines range should be 15-21 months imprisonment.  They also requested a downward departure from that range, seeking only probation without incarceration.

After the sentencing memorandum from the government was filed, President Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227122206783811585) 

>""This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!""  

>>@ChuckRossDC  ""Prosecutors recommend up to NINE YEARS in prison for Roger Stone. They call foreign election interference a ""deadly adversary"" even though Stone was never accused of working with Russians or WikiLeaks.""

After that news breaking, one of the prosecutors who had signed the original sentencing brief [gave notice to the court that he was no longer working on the case, and had resigned as a special assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia.](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.282.0_5.pdf)  A second prosecutor also [resigned as an Assistant US Attorney](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583/gov.uscourts.dcd.203583.283.0_3.pdf) shortly thereafter.

The supplemental memorandum says:

>The prior filing submitted by the United States on February 10, 2020 (Gov. Sent. Memo.
ECF No. 279) does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice’s position on what would be
a reasonable sentence in this matter. While it remains the position of the United States that a
sentence of incarceration is warranted here, the government respectfully submits that the range of
87 to 108 months presented as the applicable advisory Guidelines range would not be appropriate
or serve the interests of justice in this case

My questions are:

1.  If the DoJ changed its position due to the President's tweet, or other pressure from the President, is that lawful?  Does it make a difference that the conduct Stone lied about related to the President's campaign?

2.  Is it in compliance with DoJ guidelines for attorneys, or the rules of professional ethics?"

> “Unwilling to cope with the results of last November’s election, the Legislature introduced this unconstitutional bill as a form of therapy to deal with their disbelief at the 2016 election results, and to play politics to their base.""

Sponsor of the current iteration of this legislation in New Jersey, State Senator Loretta Weinberg, defends the measure, saying (from 3rd source): 

> “It is so obvious with this president that had voters known some of what seem to be his business interests, he may not have been elected president.""

Supporters of the bill may have a constitutional argument (from 3rd source):

> Supporters say states have room under the U.S. Constitution to create ballot access requirements and argue that voters should be able to review candidates’ tax returns in deciding who to send to the White House.

I have three questions on this topic:

1: Do any States currently have unique requirements that must be met to be listed on the State ballot in a Presidential election?

2: Specifically to tax returns; can states force a candidate to disclose this information or take them off the State ballot?

3: Are there clear limits for what information States can require of Presidential candidates to include them on their ballots?

How does the number of resignations and firings during the Trump administration compare to past administrations?,"In light of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe [stepping down today](https://www.axios.com/fbi-deputy-director-andrew-mccabe-is-stepping-down-5e60dee9-3fe4-4b18-bf57-fb037c0faabb.html), adding to the [growing list of firings/resignations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/12/14/white-house-departures-whos-been-fired-and-who-resigned-trump-administration/951641001/) (updated as of 12/14/17) of high-level Trump Administration staff, is this an abnormal amount of high-level job attrition?

How do the major US parties handle deaths of presumptive nominees or nominees?,"This question is a little morbid, but given that [both of the remaining major contenders for the Democratic nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#Active_candidates) and [the only major contender for the Republican nomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries) are over 70, and there is a pandemic illness spreading which [appears to be a particular risk for older adults](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html#who-is-higher-risk) I think it is worth discussing.

What exactly are the procedures for when a candidate dies or becomes incapacitated during the electoral process?

If before a convention, what happens to delegates accumulated by that candidate?

If after the convention, how is a replacement candidate chosen?

Is there any process for determining a nominee to be incapacitated without their consent?

These answers might differ for the two parties, so I'd appreciate if people could specify which party's rules they're discussing."
What are the costs and benefits of nuclear power (as opposed to other green sources of energy such as wind and solar) as it stands now?,"United States Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders recently released his plan to move away from carbon emissions with the Green New Deal. The plan omits any plans for investment in nuclear energy, and instead opts mostly for ways such as solar or wind energy https://berniesanders.com/issues/the-green-new-deal/ 
Is there any reason that nuclear should or shouldn't be a part of any plans as ambitious as this one? Also, how does nuclear stack up against wind in solar in terms of efficiency, safety and viability?

Just to elaborate on why nuclear energy could be considered green energy in the same vein as solar and wind; nuclear energy is zero-emission, meaning that there is no carbon dioxide by-product when nuclear energy creates electricity https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable"

For those who are confused, the Constitution splits up power between three branches of government.  The Executive, the Legislative and the Judicial.  Each one has *enumerated* powers, meaning powers explicitly written into the Constitution for that branch to exercise.  In theory, this would help stop the concentration of power into one branch.  However, overtime, Congress has delegated powers to the Executive branch (as well as to its independent agencies) to carry out laws created by the Legislative branch; these powers are sometimes referred to as apart of the ""Administrative State"".

Announcing our Debate Fact-Checking Initiative,"We have been thinking about how best to approach the Presidential debates, and have decided that we are going to post live fact-checking threads for at least the first Presidential debate (after which we'll assess and see how it went).  

In deciding on this, we have looked at our past megathreads, such as for the primary election results, primary debates, convention speeches, and the Brexit vote.

The megathread format we most often used, some introductory questions and then a live tick-tock works great for election nights, but not as well for debates and speeches.  So we're gonna try something new.

The way it will work is as follows:

* **All top level comments will be posted by mods.**

Top level comments will contain a quote from one or both candidates transcribed by one of us while watching the debate.  Obviously this will be live so there may be errors.  But to avoid duplications, this will be done only by the mod team.

* **Users can reply to mod comments with a fact check of the candidate statement.**

All fact checks **must** contain a link to a source stating what the true thing is, and must also clearly explain why it contradicts or confirms what the candidate said.  Replies to top level comments without a link will be summarily removed.

* **Users can then reply to each other in third-level and above comments**

Normal NeutralPolitics rules will still apply.

---

*Edit for clarification* Since this has come up a couple times: The NP mod team will not be doing the fact checking, but we are rather providing a forum for our users to fact check.  The only thing we're doing in an ""official"" capacity is transcribing the candidate statements.  We report; you fact check."

I'm not so much concerned about the specifics of these events in particular. The part that caught my eye said:

>Trump has said he assigned all his business interests to a trust overseen by one of his sons, Donald Trump Jr., and a longtime Trump Organization executive, Allen Weisselberg. However, Trump retains the ability to revoke the trust at any time and as the sole beneficiary stands to benefit financially from it. As of May 2016, Donald Trump owned 100 percent of DTTM Operations LLC, according to his Federal Election Commission disclosure. Its current ownership structure is unclear. Delaware public records do not disclose the management of DTTM Operations LLC, though they do show that Trump's sons and Weisselberg served as directors of a related company.

This has also been reported [here](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-donald-trump-trust-20170204-story.html) and in the NYT article in #3 below.

2. Administered by his son and Trump executive officer who will provide ""reports on any profit, or loss, on his company as a whole""

3. [The purpose of the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is to hold assets for the 'exclusive benefit' of the president](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/donald-trump-business.html)

Why keep or eliminate Net Neutrality?,"Due to today's events, there have been a lot of submissions on this topic, but none quite in compliance with our guidelines, so the mods are posting this one for discussion.

Thanks to /u/Easyflip, /u/DracoLannister, /u/anger_bird, /u/sufjanatic.

In April of this year, the FCC [proposed to reverse](https://www.fcc.gov/document/restoring-internet-freedom) the Title II categorization of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that was enacted in 2015:

> The Commission's 2015 decision to subject ISPs to Title II utility-style regulations risks that innovation, serving ultimately to threaten the open Internet it purported to preserve.

> The Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)has proposed a *Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)* to end the utility-style regulatory approach that gives government control of the Internet and to restore the market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and to reverse the decline in infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for consumers put into motion by the FCC in 2015. To determine how to best honor our commitment to restoring Internet Freedom, the NPRM also evaluates the existing rules governing Internet service providers' practices.


When the 2015 rules were passed, FCC commissioner Ajit Pai (now chairman) issued a [dissenting statement:](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A5.pdf)

> ...reclassifying broadband, applying the bulk of Title II rules, and half-heartedly forbearing from the rest ""for now"" will drive smaller competitors out of business and leave the rest in regulatory vassalage

and

> ...the Order ominously claims that ""[t]hreats to Internet openness remain today,"" that broadband providers ""hold all the tools necessary to deceive consumers, degrade content or disfavor the content that they don’t like,"" and that the FCC continues ""to hear concerns about other broadband provider practices involving blocking or degrading third-party applications.""

> The evidence of these continuing threats? There is none; it’s all anecdote, hypothesis, and hysteria.


It is [widely believed](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/ajit-pai-announces-plan-to-eliminate-title-ii-net-neutrality-rules/) that reversing the Title II categorization would spell the end for [Net Neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality) rules.

This sub requires posts be neutrally framed, so this one asks about both sides of the issue.

If you can make a good, well-sourced summary of the arguments for eliminating Net Neutrality rules, it would probably help a lot of people to better understand the issue.

Overall the purpose of this seems to be that they believe Twitter is considered a “designated public forum” for 1st amendment purposes. As a result, Twitter users can not be blocked by Trump (and I assumed it can be inferred by any government official) due to the fact that blocked users can no longer see, copy, post, or otherwise interact with said government officials twitter posts.

Is there a significant sentencing disparity between black people and white people in the US that isn't otherwise explained by the difference in crime rates?,"There seems to be a lot of contradictory evidence on this question.  In pursuit of objectivity I'd like to pose it to /r/neutralpolitics.

On the side of ""there is no sentencing disparity"", I found an article [here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/4847/6-leftist-myths-about-criminal-justice-system-get-ben-shapiro) that makes the following claims:

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Overprosecute Blacks.** For literally decades, studies have demonstrated that there is statistical parity between crime reports and arrests. Unless witnesses in the black community – predominantly the victims of black crime – are somehow racist against blacks, cops are arresting people who are guilty of crimes.

>**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Sentence Blacks Disproportionately Longer.**...studies have actually shown a slightly lower chance of prosecution and slightly lower sentences for black convicts...“A 1994 Justice Department survey of felony cases from the country’s 75 largest urban areas discovered that blacks actually had a lower chance of prosecution following a felony than whites did and that they were less likely to be found guilty at trial. Following conviction, blacks were more likely to receive prison sentences, however – an outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records.”

I couldn't find a source for ""there is parity between crime reports and crime rates"", but if that is true it seems to lend itself to the conclusion being that the higher arrest rate of blacks is due to their higher crime rate, rather than due to prejudice on the part of police officers.  While a counterargument might be that the crime reports are disproportionately done by white members of majority black communities, or by white police officers, this also doesn't take into account the fact that black members of the community or black police officers may also have a bias against black people in that regard, and that this implicitly assumes from the start that white officers and community members have this bias.

I did find [the source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc94.pdf) for the second claim, but I couldn't validate the ""and outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records"" claim.  I couldn't find much information on this one reading the report, but a number of other sources mention this report so I'm inclined to believe it's true.  However I'd like more information.

On the other side, I have [this slate article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/08/racial_disparities_in_the_criminal_justice_system_eight_charts_illustrating.html) which makes a few other claims.

>**Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.**

It gives [this source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/?utm_term=.783daadc09c6).  The counterargument is that black people simply speed more than white people.  I couldn't find evidence for this however, but I'm not sure this is certain evidence of racial bias among police officers.

It's quite long, and I'm not sure if it takes into account prior convictions, which is a potential counterargument.  Furthermore it seems to contradict the second piece of evidence on the other side.  This is the big piece of evidence that I'm confused about, and am not sure which side to believe.

Both of these articles are biased in some way, but I think taking these 2 claims from each of them provides a good starting point for the conversation.  Is there a disparity in sentencing, incarceration, policing, arrests, etc between blacks and whites that can't otherwise be explained by the difference in crime rates?  Does racial prejudice factor into it?

Is there data that supports the conservative claim that lower corporate taxes leads to higher wages?,"In a speech recently, President Trump said ""[Lower taxes on American business mean higher wages for American workers,](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-calls-for-lower-taxes-on-rich-people-while-houston-drowns-e759a8abefe5/)”

What are the pros and cons of the Standing Rock pipeline?,"A pipeline is proposed to be built in Standing Rock in North Dakota and protests are happening to block it.

- http://standingrock.org/data/upfiles/media/Standing%20Rock%20responds%20to%20Consultation%20Invite_final_9.23.16.pdf

Many of my Facebook friends are ""checking in"" in order to support protesters who are attempting to block the construction of the oil pipeline. I really don't know much about the issue and every article I read seems to have a strong bias so I've decided to come here.

For the sake of sensible discussion I'll break my post into sub-questions:

1. Did the people building the oil pipeline follow a legal process? Is that process fair?

2. What are the benefits of building the pipeline?

3. What are the drawbacks of building the pipeline?

4. Will the pipeline create a net positive impact? Who are the winners and who are the losers?

5. [This article](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/29/us/dakota-pipeline-standing-rock-sioux/index.html) suggests that a lot of the protesters are flooding in from other states (and will not be directly affected by the outcome of a seemingly local decision). Is this a good or bad precedent?"

What is the evidence to support and contradict the accusation that Iran is responsible for the attacks? Is there any evidence that the attack was perpetrated by, or within the capabilities of, another party? Regardless of who was responsible, for what reasons would someone want to attack commercial shipping in this area?"
What policies allow the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader to refuse to vote on important issues?

NeutralPolitics Super Tuesday Megathread,"Welcome to the biggest night of the primary season: Super Tuesday.  Today, 14 states as well as American Samoa^1 will be voting in primary elections to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention.^2

* **How are the delegates are awarded?**

 The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is **15%.**  If a candidate is [above 15%](https://www.270towin.com/content/thresholds-for-delegate-allocation-2020-democratic-primary-and-caucus) in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote.  If you're below 15%, [you get nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)

 States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts [that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml)^3  So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.  

* **How many delegates are at stake tonight?**

 [There are 1357 delegates up for grabs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/us/politics/2020-super-tuesday-states.html) out of a total of [3979 total.](https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination)  1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.  

 Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#March_1,_2016:_Super_Tuesday) largely because California moved its primary to today.  As both the most populous state and a Democratic stronghold, it has huge delegate numbers, 415, accounting for more than 1/10 of the entire number of delegates available.

* **When will we know results?**

 It will vary, with the first polls closing at [7PM ET in Virginia, and the last polls closing at 11PM ET in California.](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/3/21161503/super-tuesday-voting-polls-results-what-time)

 However, some results may take quite a while.  California especially is both the biggest haul today, and [famously slow](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/809941998/on-super-tuesday-dont-expect-quick-election-results-from-the-west) in counting ballots.  Because California encourages a lot of mail voting, and counts ballots mailed on election day, they won't have all the ballots in today, and will need to process a lot of envelopes.

* **Who is gonna win?**

 Who do I look like, Nate Silver?

I'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.

Before results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:

Besides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?

**7:00PM ET** First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.

**7:07PM ET** Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing _very_ well in the exit poll, which [has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/virginia-results?icid=election_nav) with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold.  If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else. 

**7:30PM ET** Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.

**7:37PM ET** American Samoa has reported [the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/american-samoa-results?icid=election_nav) of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process.  Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.

**7:58PM ET** Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there.  In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.

**8:00PM ET**  Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.

**8:10PM ET** Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden. 

**8:23PM ET** Seeing some results in TX showing a close race, but I think that's early vote, so it might move a lot as we get today's vote in if trends in late deciders from VA/NC/AL hold into TX.

**8:26PM ET** For those who are election turbonerds like me, the DecisionDeskHQ people use some different methods from most of the networks to get results numbers, and are usually a good bit faster at reporting.  So if you're the kinda person who need their results now, it may be worth dealing with their signup.

**8:30PM ET** Arkansas polls closed, no call at polls close.

**8:37PM ET**  Looks like outside of MA, Warren is struggling to hit the 15% threshold in many states, so she'll probably be looking at a quite small delegate haul out of tonight, unless she does surprisingly well in CA.  She might get a few congressional district delegates still in other states, or results may change, but being below 15% statewide is a big loss in delegate terms.

Bloomberg is also shy of the mark in a few states so far.  Looks like he'll miss in VA, VT, and MA.  So far looks like he'll make it in states that have closed so far, but if that's early vote reports, he might fall on election day totals.

**8:47PM ET** With about 90% of results in from Virginia, NYT is allocating about 67 delegates to Biden, 31 delegates to Sanders, 1 to Warren.

**9:00PM ET** Texas, Minnesota, and Colorado polls close.  No calls at closing.

**9:03PM ET** Biden is expanding his lead in NC as same day vote comes in, with Bloomberg falling and possibly on track to end up below the threshold.

**9:11PM ET** Looks like networks are calling TN for Biden.  Seems that Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg will all make the threshold there.

**9:17PM ET** More calls: OK for Biden, CO for Sanders.

**9:31PM ET**  MA is looking likely Biden, Sanders 2nd, Warren actually close to the threshold in her home state.  Fairly disastrous for Warren.

**9:37PM ET** Gonna take a moment to recognize the recently departed-from-the-race Amy Klobuchar for [the best walk on music of the campaign.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX06ovfnas)

**9:42PM ET**  As I said above, the 15% threshold matters a ton.  Looking at who's currently on track to make/miss it, with the proviso that this could change (and using DDHQ numbers)

* Biden: Gonna make it everywhere
* Sanders: In some danger of missing it in AL, but safe everywhere else.
* Bloomberg: Won't make it in VT or VA.  Very likely won't make it in ME, MA, AL or MN. more likely than not to miss it it in OK and TN.  In danger if late returns are bad for him in TN and TX.  Likely safe in AR.  Certain to make it in CO.
* Warren: Won't make it in most states.  Has a good shot of making it in ME, MN, and CO.  Almost certain to make it in MA.

None of these include California because polls are still open there.

**9:50PM ET**  NBC News reports that Bloomberg will [""reassess""](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1235028685717045248) his campaign tomorrow.

**9:56PM ET** Some, but not all, networks calling AR and MN for Biden.

**10:11PM ET**  Polls closed in Utah at 10PM.  Sanders holds a susbtantial lead there in early returns.

**10:14PM ET**  Update on who's hitting the 15% threshold.  Sanders looks safer to make it in Alabama, meaning he would get at least some delegates everywhere.  Bloomberg has fallen below threshold in Oklahoma and North Carolina, still teetering above it in Tennessee.

**10:31PM ET** DDHQ (but nobody else I can see) is calling MA for Biden.  If that holds, that's an extremely good sign for him.  This is really about as good of a Super Tuesday as Biden could have asked for so far.  Though California is still not even polls closed, and that is the big prize of the night.

**10:35PM ET** Utah has been called for Sanders.

**10:52PM ET** Reports are that in many precincts in California and Texas, long lines are going to delay vote results, and of course those lines reflect a substantial failure of election officials to do their job and operate an efficient election.

**11:00PM ET** Polls are now closed in California, though many voters remain in line.  If you are in line to vote, stay in line and you will be able to vote.

**11:03PM ET** AP is calling California for Sanders at polls close.  I find that a bit surprising, but I assume they have some good reasons for doing so.

**11:04PM ET** Other networks are not calling California.  I am really surprised by the AP call on zero results, especially in a heavily mail-vote state which is infamously slow to count.  I think Sanders is more likely than not to win CA (it's a strong state for him generally, and heavy early vote helps him).  But with the big late movement to Biden I'd want to get some real votes in to make that call.

**11:09PM ET** OK, I assume AP is making the call based on the exit poll, which as of 6:30PM ET had [Bernie around 38 and Biden around 23.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/california-results?icid=election_nav)  That's aggressive, but if it represents same day voters even close to accurately, I can see being comfortable with the call.  But I'd still hold off on a call.

**11:19PM ET** Gonna make a threshold chart to show where candidates are making/missing it.  

Legend:  Bold is made the threshold.  Italic is missed the threshold.  Standard is uncertain.

* Biden: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Sanders: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN,** AL, **AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**

* Bloomberg: *ME, VT, MA, VA, NC,* **TN,** *AL,* AR, *OK,* TX, **CO, UT,** *MN,* CA

* Warren: ME, *VT,* **MA,** *VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX,* **CO, UT,** MN, *CA*

**11:32PM ET** It looks like Texas will be very close between Biden and Sanders.  Given proportional allocation, it actually doesn't matter that much who ekes out a win if they're within a point of each other, though it may matter for narrative.  Much bigger is the question of whether Mike Bloomberg holds on to enough vote to crack 15% and swipe a share of delegates.  Currently he is at 18.19% which might hold him through what's been a consistent drop in day-of results for him today, but maybe not.  With it now looking like Biden would have the only path to the nomination with a majority of pledged delegates, whether Bloomberg hits the threshold in Texas could actually make a big difference.  It's probably worth on the order or 25 or so delegates.

**11:55PM ET** Based on early returns not being strong for her in CA, plus her weak performance nationwide in same day vote, I am going to project that Warren does *not* make the threshold in California.  That's a significant boost to Sanders, as it probably means he's consolidated more of the left-wing vote there, and means he has to share fewer delegates out of the only state tonight where he's still got a shot at earning big delegate haul.

**12:02AM ET** With 100% reporting in TN, I can say Mike Bloomberg has made the threshold there.  NYT projects 34 Biden delegates,  21 Sanders, 9 Bloomberg out of TN.

**12:09AM ET** With over 90% reporting in Utah and Colorado (per DDHQ) I am comfortable calling that Warren _will_ make the threshold in those states.  That will cut down the haul Sanders gets out of them, though if Warren eventually drops out and supports Sanders, he would benefit on net from this outcome.  (That is a big ""if"").

**12:17AM ET** Biden is now on track to win Texas, and probably by a few points.  The delegate math is hard to pencil out because Bloomberg is still dropping on same day results, and flirting with the 15% threshold.  My best guess is Biden nets ~12 delegates if Bloomberg makes the threshold, and nets ~20 delegates if Bloomberg misses it.  Perhaps more importantly, Biden probably gets 20 more delegates in absolute terms if Bloomberg misses the threshold than if he makes it, which helps his prospects for a first ballot win.

**12:28AM ET** I am gonna call the liveblog here because I like sleep.  Overall, this is about as good a Super Tuesday for Biden as he could have asked for.  Sanders is in contention but in trouble.  Warren and Bloomberg do not seem to have any viable path to the nomination.

^1 American Samoa had a caucus.

^2 There is also a Republican primary today, but it is not seriously contested.

^3 If they didn't do this, then you'd see districts which are heavily republican get far more delegates per democratic primary voter than heavily democratic districts."
Have US presidents in the past have similar public animosity (as Trump has with judge James Robart) towards judges who ruled against them?,"Off the top of my head i can remember  [Andrew Jackson ignoring the Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia) and [Obama being ruled against by the Supreme Court](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Texas), but i am not aware of them using the kind of rhetoric used by President Trump [""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!""](https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/827867311054974976) , [""Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril.

"Why does Sanders have a significantly higher favorable rating with Democratic voters than Clinton, and policies that are very popular with Democrats, yet is losing by millions of votes?","According to the most recent Gallup polling, Sanders has a net favorable rating of +57 with Democratic voters, while Clinton has a net favorable rating of +46, 11 less than Sanders. [Source](http://www.gallup.com/poll/189299/presidential-election-2016-key-indicators.aspx?g_source=POLITICS&g_medium=topic&g_campaign=tiles)


Why is Sanders seen favorably by a larger number of Democrats and unfavorably by a smaller number than Clinton yet has lost the Democratic Primary by more than 3 million votes?


Not only that, but his policies are supported by the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters:


64%-16% support single-payer tax-funded healthcare


61%-19% support tax-funded free college tuition


71%-18% support a federal $15 minimum wage


83%-8% support raising taxes on families making >$250,000 per year

"Is the shutdown a ""canary in a coal mine"" for income security and retirement preparedness in the United States?","The continuing partial government shutdown  has highlighted a continuing challenge for the affected government  workers and for American society as a whole - nearly 80% of workers are  living ""paycheck to paycheck"" ([https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html)).   As a corollary, roughly half of U.S. consumers  don’t even have one  month’s savings, and couldn’t handle a single emergency, like an  unexpected transmission repair (or a partial government shutdown) ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-again-americans-are-not-saving-enough-2018-08-28](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/once-again-americans-are-not-saving-enough-2018-08-28)).   And, not only do many Americans not have short-term cash reserves,  they are also unprepared for long-term (retirement) monetary needs ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2018/02/28/retirement-3/#723d771a6935](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateashford/2018/02/28/retirement-3/#723d771a6935)).   In fact, 35% of American households do not participate in \*any\*  retirement plan and of the 65% that do, the median household has only  $1,100 of retirement funds ([https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/many-americans-still-lack-retirement-savings](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2018/many-americans-still-lack-retirement-savings)).

Does  the U.S. government have a responsibility to provide a ""safety net"" for  affected government workers who do not have adequate short-term  reserves to weather the shutdown?

Is  there any bipartisan support for changes in government policy to help  address the lack of both short-term and long-term savings for most  American households?

Are any proposed solutions to the partial government shutdown addressing or commenting on these challenges?"
"Farm Seizures in South Africa: Is this a wide-spread practice, and what are the government's stated goals?","An article posted to the NZ Herald 3 days ago made it to the top of r/news, with the headline reading, ""[South Africa begins seizing white-owned farms](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12110366)."" Earlier today, the US President tweeted on the same topic: 

>I have asked Secretary of State @MikePompeo4USA to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews"" 

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032454567152246785

From my own searches, it's very hard to get reliable information on this topic.

The NZ Herald article, for example, doesn't point to a particular government policy targeting white farms, instead alluding to a list, released by a pro-Afrikaner civil-rights group, which supposedly names 190 targeted farms ""being circulated"" within the Department of Land Reform and Rural Development. The two farms seized by the government were reportedly the first two farms on this supposed list. The South African government denies knowledge of such a list existing.

With the House of Representatives moving in the direction of impeachment, the subreddit has been inundated with submissions on the details of the scandal, as well as the legal and political processes around it.

The mods are posting this thread to seek advice and feedback from users on how to handle this, as the volume of posts has become difficult, and we have unfortunately had some threads go off the rails.

A few options we have are:

1. **Using ""green"" questions to ask about major new developments.**  That is where the mods will write up a rules-compliant thread on a subject of major interest.  We have done this in the past with similar subjects.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/6a9j3d/is_there_evidence_to_suggest_the_firing_of_james/) for example.

2. **Just keep having normal question threads.**

Is Robert Mueller legally barred from commenting on the removal of Sessions as AG or addressing any impact it has on his investigation?,"Maybe this is silly, but I actually can't find a statement from Robert Mueller showing that he concerned with the removal of Sessions and the implications that Whitaker taking over will hamper him. 

Frankly, I can't seem to find any quotes from Mueller at all about the the DOJ switch or him being obstructed or really anything about the investigation, with the exception of:

* the false claims statement: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/30/mueller-accuses-opponents-of-offering-money-to-make-false-claims-about-him.html

* His DOJ page with his appointment, expenditures, indictments, and subpoenas https://www.justice.gov/sco.

Everything else is from ""anonymous sources"" or ""sources with knowledge of the situation"". It doesn't appear he's said a word about the DOJ change. Politicians sound very concerned it will hamper him. Journalists and citizens too.

Is Mueller legally barred from making any statements about the investigation or DOJ change, such that he could *not* voice concern if he felt his team was being obstructed or hampered? 

Is there a law or statute governing the position of Special Council that makes it such that he cannot address this?

What are the legal implications of the Trump administration's new change to the DoJ definition of sexual assault?,"Under [the old definition](https://web.archive.org/web/20180405013124/https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault), 

> Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.

Under the [new definition](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault):

> The term “sexual assault” means any nonconsensual sexual act proscribed by Federal, tribal, or State law, including when the victim lacks capacity to consent.

Most state laws were less stringent than the old definition of sexual assault. For example, [here](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/compare.cfm)'s a comparison of the legal definition of consent in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Montana. 

According to [RAINN's database](https://apps.rainn.org/policy/), only 8 states require ""affirmative or freely given consent."" Those states are Florida, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Minnesota, Washington, New Jersey, Illinois, and California. 

What are the legal implications of the change in wording? "
How can the US government consistently spend more than it makes? Where does the extra money come from?,"I recently came across this infographic. https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/graphic/52408-budgetoverall.pdf


2016 we spent 600 billion more dollars than we got. So where did we get the money? did we borrow it from other countries? are there a bunch of banks that we owe that money with interest now? Do we just print the money we don't have? what's going on?

and apparently this happens MOST years in the US government? how? If a person spends more than they make every year eventually they have to stop.

So where does the government get the bonus money?"
President Trump will have a second meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in February. What progress towards US objectives has been made since the last official summit?,"Sarah Sanders has confirmed that Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un will meet in February at a location to be confirmed at a later date.

This is being reported by [Axios](https://www.axios.com/second-trump-kim-summit-february-c83f07eb-4620-4db8-a706-7722a0a3f528.html) as well as the Voice of America, which was picked up by [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/18/18186799/north-korea-trump-kim-summit-nuclear).

President Trump held the first ever meeting between a US President and North Korea in [June of 2018](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_North_Korea%E2%80%93United_States_summit). This will be the second meeting between Kim Jon Un and Trump.

There has been reporting that [North Korea has little intention of dismantling their nuclear weapons program](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/us/politics/north-korea-missile-bases.html) because they continue to made improvements to their existing facilities.

Who does Robert Mueller report to and who decides his budget and how long the investigation is allowed to go for?,"[Reuters are reporting](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-lawyer-exclusive-idUSKBN1AH5F9) that Robert S. Mueller III is hiring a 16th member of the independent [Special Counsel investigation team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Special_Counsel_investigation).

Mueller was [appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/17/us/politics/document-Robert-Mueller-Special-Counsel-Russia.html).

But is that really where the influence ends? Who decides how much budget he has? Can Rosenstein or anyone else influence the investigation by limiting the budget or vetoing staff hires? Or by other means like imposing an unrealistic timeline? 

How often and to whom does he have to report to make sure he's using the funds appropriately and is this an area for potential influence?

Does such a line of reporting and oversight mean someone like Rosenstein is actually privy to what Mueller has found so far and what he's planning?

Ultimately what's the effect on the independence of the investigation?

Edit: The practical questions are answered in the comments. The question remains as to how much influence this permits. Theoretically it's a lot, and it's not clear how Rosenstein's decision making can be challenged. Sessions can't, Trump won't. We're relying on Rosenstein's personal ethics (which seem to be holding up). In practice I hope that if Mueller feels he can't do a proper job he'd go public. Any thoughts? "
Jill Stein wants a recount - why does she need $6-7 million to do so?,"[According to the Guardian, which is citing her fundraising page](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/23/jill-stein-election-recount-fund-michigan-wisconsin-pennsylvania), Jill Stein expects ""to need $6 to 7 million to challenge the results in all three states"" (Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin).

"Most US States do not require motorcyclists to wear a helmet. Evidence shows helmets are effective in reducing fatalities and injuries from accidents, and yet some states have repealed or relaxed their helmet laws. Where did this push come from, and have there been any benefits from repeals?","The [exact law](https://www.iihs.org/topics/motorcycles/motorcycle-helmet-laws-table) on when you are required to wear a helmet differs from state to state, but most states do not require helmets for motorcyclists, even if they require them for bicyclists under the age of 18.

This is very state specific, and even in cases where there is an exception, it might be behind a requirement. Take [Texas for example](https://www.txdot.gov/driver/share-road/motorcycles.html) where:

> All riders under the age of 21 are required to wear a helmet when operating a motorcycle. Riders over 21 may ride without a helmet only if they have completed a safety course or are covered by an applicable insurance plan.

Overall, more states allow for motorcyclists to not wear a helmet (like Texas) than force them to wear a helmet (Source 1).

The CDC says [helmets are associated](https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/mc/index.html) with a reduction in injuries and fatalities from accidents.

States that have repealed or weakened their helmet laws include [Kentucky and Louisiana](https://one.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/kentuky-la03/index.html), [Florida](https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/1839), and [Michigan](https://www.iihs.org/media/13465fd7-23d7-46fd-a15e-ddf13d66c490/dsoeSw/HLDI%20Research/Bulletins/hldi_bulletin_30.09.pdf). 

In each case, repealing or weakening helmet laws was associated with negative effects such as [insurance increases, more fatalities, and more head injuries](https://www.iihs.org/topics/motorcycles#helmet-laws).

---

I have a couple of questions on this topic:

1: For specific states like Florida, Michigan, and other that have relaxed their helmet requirements -- what was the push do so? Where did the motivation come from?

2: Have there been any benefits for states that relaxed their helmet requirements?"
How Serious is Climate Change/Global Warming and to What Extent Are Humans Causing It?,"I come from a conservative family, and my parents come close to [Trump's views on Climate Change] (https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en).

 So, my question is, objectively, how serious is the threat of Climate Change/Global Warming, and how much are humans actually causing it? I personally don't deny the science behind it, the greenhouse effect, and I have a general, vague idea of the changes in weather patterns that are said to be caused by it, but how much is [natural shift]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age) in temperature/climate, and how much is caused by humans.

2: Is there any evidence or arguments a wall would address the crises the Trump administration has highlighted?

3: In a historical context, do any of the metrics the Trump administration point to show evidence of a new or developing crisis?

The difference between 'testing' and 'tampering' is important. *Witness tampering* is a crime under [18 U.S. Code § 1512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512).

However, as the Nancy Pelosi mentions and the [New York Times explains](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony.html), Gaetz might be protected under the 'speech and debate' clause:

> Like all members of Congress, Mr. Gaetz is covered under the “speech or debate” clause of the Constitution, which grants lawmakers wide latitude in their comments when Congress is in session and has been cited many times in the past as protection against punishment.

I have a couple of questions about this:

1: Does the tweet alone by Gaetz constitute witness tampering?

2: How does Gaetz's special status as a member of Congress under the 'speech and debate' clause affect such a charge?

Incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (Liberal) faces Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, as well as NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, Green leader Elizabeth May, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and the new People's Party leader Maxime Bernier.

Polls have now closed across Canada.

For those not up on Canadian geography and wondering ""Does Canada really span 6 time zones?"" Yes, [Canada is really big.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhiDILWFXBE)


[Polls have forecast that it is most likely no party will win a majority of the seats in Parliament.](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/)  

In that event, there may be significant political jockeying over who can successfully hold the Prime Minister's office.

If you want a very detailed view of the law around forming government,^2 [this article from Professor Philippe Lagassé is an excellent overview.](https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/constitutional_forum/index.php/constitutional_forum/article/view/29384/21386)

Once polls start closing I will begin a tick tock with results and other relevant news.

**4:32 PM EDT** Re: some questions in the comments, I am gonna talk a little bit about how things work in a minority government situation.

* As incumbent Prime Minister, Trudeau remains in office until and unless he resigns or is dismissed by the Governor General (GG) (Lagassé p. 6).

* There is a custom, not rule, that the party with the most seats will usually serve as the government.  If Trudeau's Liberals do not have the most seats, and he follows this custom, he would resign to allow the party with the most seats to form government. (Lagassé p. 11)

* If Trudeau does not resign as PM, when Parliament reconvenes, he will face a vote to test [whether he has the confidence of the Commons](https://www.ourcommons.ca/About/ProcedureAndPractice3rdEdition/ch_02_2-e.html) (the vote on the address in reply to the speech from the throne).

* If Trudeau passes that vote, he stays as PM.

* If Trudeau fails that vote, he could either resign, or advise the Governor General to call a snap election.

* If Trudeau resigned after losing confidence, the GG would choose the person the GG thought most likely to hold the confidence of the Commons, by practice the leader of the opposition is that person. (Lagassé p. 8)

* If Trudeau advised a snap election after losing confidence, the GG would decide whether she thought there was another viable government.  

 * If she thinks another viable government exists, she would refuse Trudeau's advice, and appoint an alternate government.  Trudeau would be forced to resign, or be formally dismissed if he did not resign. (Lagassé p. 6)

 * If she thinks another viable government does not exist, she would agree to the advice, dissolve Parliament, and call a snap election.  Trudeau would remain PM through such a snap election. (Lagassé p. 8)

**8:00 PM EDT Lib: 5**  Lot of seats in NS and NB where conservatives are looking good, but very few votes in so far.  NDP looks likely to get a flip in Saint John's East.

**8:23 PM EDT Lib: 8; NDP: 1** First flip of the night.  NDP has taken Saint John's East from the Liberals.  Conservatives are leading in 6 seats (all previously Liberal) but have not gotten any of them called for them.  About an hour still until we get the giant polls close from all of Canada except BC, so will be lots more parsing Atlantic Canada for a while yet.

**8:41 PM EDT Lib 12; Con 2; NDP 1**  Conservatives have their first flips of the night, both in New Brunswick along the Maine border.  Leading in a few more in NB, lots of very close races there, as well as a few close ones in NS.

**8:45 PM EDT Lib 14; Con 2; NDP 1** Greens are now leading in Fredericton but not elected there yet.  Conservatives in 2nd there right now. 

**9:06 PM EDT Lib 18; Con 3; NDP 1** Added a French stream from TVA above.  Also interesting we have some votes from Gaspe area because of the time zone.  Liberal incumbent leading the Bloc candidate by a little bit, but not much in yet.

**9:26 PM EDT Lib 19; Con 3; NDP 1**  Ok just before the huge polls close, looks like the Liberals are decently positioned to hold a plurality.  Will be interesting how much the Bloc can take both from the other 3 parties with QC seats in the overall balance of power.  They are now leading in the Gaspe seat.  This will be a long night.

**9:30 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 3; NDP 1**  Okay, here we go!  Big poll close time.

**9:40 PM EDT Lib 20; Con 4; NDP 1** I'm only saying called seats, but Liberals are leading in a lot of spots.  Bloc not getting too many leads.  Bernier of the People's Party looks to be getting his seat. 

**9:44 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1**  One GTA suburbs seat with meaningful vote in, going well for the Liberals.  If they perform like this in the rest of the Toronto area, Justin Trudeau will have a very good night.

**9:47 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** And now they're behind in that seat... so things are swinging a lot.  Bernier is also now behind in his seat.

**9:53 PM EDT Lib 21; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Bloc and Liberals are cutting up Quebec between them, which is pretty good for the Liberals, and a (mostly expected) disaster for the NDP.

**9:58 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Liberals are leading in 94 seats and are only seeing a net swing of -6 so far, which is really strong for them, since they could lose about 16 and still have a majority.

**10:00 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1**  Polls are now closed across Canada.

**10:05 PM EDT Lib 22; Con 4; NDP 1** Looks like the Liberals are leading in a lot of GTA seats, seems like all of the seats in Mississauga and Brampton so far are red, as well as the center Toronto seats.  Couple of seats up by Vaughan with a Conservative lead.

**10:10 PM EDT**  **CBC is projecting a Liberal government** (though probably more fair to say Liberal plurality).

**10:15 PM EDT Lib 23; Con 8; NDP 1**  Based on leads, Liberals are losing about net 20 seats, and probably on track to lose some more which would put them into minority government territory.

**10:23 PM EDT  Lib 26; Con 19; BQ 2; NDP 1**  Liberal minority government projected, big question will be whether Liberal+NDP will make it to 170.  Right now they are just at that line with leading + elected.  150 Liberal leading+elected, 20 NDP leading+ elected.

**10:39 PM EDT Lib 52; Con 58; BQ 10; NDP 1** Despite Conservative lead in locked-up seats, Liberals still leading in plenty more.  Looks like all the party leaders on track to hold their seats.

**10:50 PM EDT Lib 77; Con 73; BQ 18; NDP 2** I was mistaken about all the leaders keeping their seats.  Bernier is defeated, and the PPC is getting very little traction.  Trudeau and Scheer have won their seats.  May is leading in her seat, as is Singh (though Singh is only up by a few percent).

**11:02 PM EDT Lib 100; Con 85; BQ 22; NDP 6; Grn 1** Interestingly, the Liberals are likely to be in government despite getting less popular vote than the Conservatives, though extremely close right now.  33.8% Liberal, 33.9% Conservative.  Definitely the Liberals are seeing big vote efficiency advantages, with Alberta especially having some huge blowout ridings where the Conservatives do not get much of any advantage by winning by 50+%.

**11:15 PM EDT Lib 110; Con 95; BQ 25; NDP 9; Grn 1**  Looks like based on leading+elected that the Liberals would only need the support of one of the NDP or Bloc to have a working majority, so that gives them several paths to keeping confidence of the Commons (seems by far most likely they'd do that through the NDP).

**11:24 PM EDT Lib 114; Con 97; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2** Greens look to be getting about 4 seats tonight, which would be by far their best haul ever.  

We also are looking at a pretty definite popular vote / seat count split, with the Liberals now 0.6% behind the Conservatives in raw vote, but far ahead in seat count.

**11:28 PM EDT Lib 115; Con 100; BQ 26; NDP 9; Grn 2**  Liberals are going to be locked out of having any seats in Alberta and probably Saskatchewan, which could be a problem for regional divisions.

**11:40 PM EDT  Lib 120; Con 106; BQ 26; NDP 11; Grn 2**  Going to end the tick tock here.  Results of the night seem pretty clear.  Biggest remaining question seems to be whether Scheer remains conservative leader.

^1 I do not know why Canadian electoral districts are called ""ridings"" in English.  Anyone have a good source on that?

^2 For readers not used to Westminster-style systems, ""government"" is used in the way ""administration"" would be used in the American context.  So the ""Trudeau government"" is the current administration in charge of Canada, consisting of PM Trudeau, his cabinet, and other senior political officials.  The term is not used here to mean the whole apparatus of the state, as it often would be in the US."

What are the pros and cons of the US building a wall along the entirety of the US/Mexico border?,"One of Donald Trump's core campaign promises [beginning from his very first campaign event](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/) has been to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and make Mexico pay for that wall.

In 2006, Congress enacted a law which provided for [approximately 700 miles of fencing along the US/Mexico border.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Fence_Act_of_2006)  That program was the basis for [Trump's executive order relating to constructing a wall.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements)

What estimates have been put forth for the cost of constructing a wall?  How effective has border enforcement been recently?  What can we learn from the Secure Fence Act in terms of the logistics and pitfalls of a project like the one Trump has proposed?"
The 2nd Circuit has ruled that Trump cannot block critics on Twitter. Does this set a new precedent or is it within the confines of existing law?,"This is going to be a difficult one to discuss here because of the source requirements, but I'm hoping the mods can be a bit flexible with this. So here goes:

[The 2nd Circuit ruled that Trump cannot block critics on Twitter.](https://reason.com/2019/07/09/2nd-circuit-agrees-that-trump-cannot-constitutionally-block-critics-on-twitter) The sub headline reads:

>The court says the ""interactive space"" created by his account is a public forum, meaning that the president's viewpoint discrimination violates the First Amendment.

Now, the question I have is this: It's long been understood that Twitter (and Facebook, and such) are free to police the content on their site however they'd like, [such as banning Alex Jones.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/twitter-permanently-bans-alex-jones-and-infowars-accounts.html) This is because they're ""private"" companies, because despite being publicly traded, they're not government-run entities. 

Based on [*Marsh v.

Neil Gorsuch nomination megathread,"We've had a number of submissions about this and decided to do a megathread concering the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

[Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/supreme-court-nominee-trump.html?action=Click&contentCollection=BreakingNews&contentID=64863353&pgtype=Homepage) is a news article about the announcement.

[Here](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/01/judge-neil-gorsuch-colorado-native-washington-d-c-insider/) is a profile of Judge Gorsuch from SCOTUSblog.

Some start off questions:

* What are some key cases that Judge Gorsuch authored?

* Does Judge Gorsuch have a record of being upheld or overturned as a district judge or circuit judge as compared to his peers?

* Have Senate Democrats indicated a desire to filibuster his nomination?"
"Did Republican lawmakers ""obstruct President Barack Obama at every turn"" to an historically ""unprecedented"" degree? What specific parts of his agenda have not been accomplished because of it?","With the end of Barack Obama's term in sight, in retrospectives and other articles trying to tally up the achievements and asking the question 'what will be the legacy of eight years of Obama', I keep seeing this phrase or variations thereof:

**Obama could have accomplished more, if not for the *unprecedented obstruction* by Republicans**

Examples:

https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/01/11/grownup-leaving-building/

>There's not enough space in this column to list all the many ways the GOP obstructed Obama.

http://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/fl-aacol-democrats-revenge-20170113-story.html

>Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010, Obama used executive power

http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/09/opinions/obama-legacy-opinion-roundup/

Elizabeth Warren even went so far as to argue that obstructionism “has created a breeding ground for new and dangerous Republican extremism” that “encourage[s] even more outrageous behavior from other Republican leaders” and “is on display in the 2016 election.” More specifically, she claimed that Republicans “have consistently blocked President Obama’s judicial nominees.”

http://newbostonpost.com/2016/06/06/warren-faults-senate-gop-for-fostering-trump-extremism/

Jesse Jackson:

>He did all of this while facing unprecedented, unrelenting partisan obstruction, with the Republican leader of the Senate opposing him at every turn, intent on making him a one-term president. In part because of that opposition, much remained undone. The stimulus would have been larger and the recovery stronger except for Republican opposition. The national minimum wage would have been raised. A national infrastructure project to rebuild America would have been launched. Progress on making America the leader of the green revolution, the next global industrial revolution, would have been greater. Guantanamo, the shameful prison in Cuba, would have been closed. The Voting Rights Act would have been revived, and much more.

http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/jesse-jackson-as-obama-departs-we-owe-him-our-thanks/

>Obama White House officials blame Senate Republicans for what they characterize as an unprecedented level of obstruction in blocking the Democratic president’s court picks.

Some even specifically blamed 'white men':

>And it is clear that he has been obstructed at every turn by white men on the right who have offered temper tantrums instead of leadership. But it is also clear that the president could have done more.

Even Bill Clinton used the phrase:

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/03/21/bill-clinton-knocks-obamas-awful-legacy/82094792/

>After President Obama was elected, Republicans made it their number one goal to block him at every turn,"" spokesman Angel Urena said in a statement. ""That unprecedented obstruction these last eight years is their legacy, and the American people should reject it by electing Hillary Clinton to build on President Obama's success so we can all grow and succeed together.""

Some other mentions of the phrase I have found either vaguely referencing how it prevented his legacy, or how it's unique to the GOP (""GOP-style""), use it to explain why he 'hasn't accomplished much' etc.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/01/03/democrats-obstruction-congress-government-gop-column/96082632/
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/the-wreckage-of-obamas-legacy.html

But others have disputed obstruction and the unprecedented nature ascribed to it:

http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2016/12/behold-the-lefts-manufactured-hysteria-about-gop-obstruction-of-judicial-nominees

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/opinion/sunday/eight-was-enough.html

>For others, the culprit is the Republican Party, which obstructed Mr. Obama at every turn. And for still others, like Mr. Obama, the problem is that his administration didn’t do enough to advertise its greatness. Even if you believe there are elements of truth in these explanations, they still amount to excuses.

Or have even argued that obstruction made him *more* powerful: http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/barack-obama-gop-most-powerful-213814


**Was Obama obstructed, and if yes**:

**a)** was this to an *historically unprecedented* degree, and if not unprecedented: is this unique to *Republican* lawmakers or have Democrats done the same thing in the past?

**b)** What -specific-  parts of Obama's agenda have not been accomplished could reasonably be blamed on *Republican obstruction*?

Do Putin's communications generally push a legitimate alternative worldview or is he often simply dishonest?,"I was curious what amount of credibility statements by Putin's administration have.  Has he been caught repeatedly lying brazenly?  If so what are the clearest examples? Does he appear to have regard for the truth, or is he instead simply using a state propoganda machine to ""muddy the water"", making it difficult to disprove falsehoods?  Or is he promoting a largely consistent worldview based on reality and facts?

I've seen a lot of skepticism about his [claims](http://www.businessinsider.com/putin-read-my-lips-no-russia-hack-us-election-trump-2017-3-2) on things like the role of Russia in our elections, as well as their stated [objectives in Syria](http://time.com/4054941/putin-russia-syria/).

The United States Spends Twice As Much Per Capita On Healthcare Compared To Other Developed Nations. To Whom Is This Spending Going?,"[Twice as much per capita.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_per_capita) And spending, even for goods, ultimately is for labor so incomes/employment should be able to tell you the whole picture of spending.  So who are the workers - medical professionals, technology suppliers, insurers, government, researchers, etc. - that the US has more of or spends more on? Are providers/administrators getting paid more or are there more of them?  And for every one of these that does not account for twice as much per capita spending, the others must cost *over* twice as much to explain difference, right?

1. *Are doctor's just charging more?*:  [Looks like](https://journal.practicelink.com/vital-stats/physician-compensation-worldwide/), doctors in the US charge about 50% more than European doctors.

2. *Are there more total workers*  I suspect this is a major cause but its hard to get numbers .  [I see](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/overview.aspx) that the NHS in England employs 1.5 million people to cover a population of 54 million people. And [this site](https://www.bls.gov/spotlight/2009/health_care/) says about 11% of workers in the US are employed in private healthcare.  I can't find any direct comparison of number of public workers in other countries vs private workers in the US.

3. *Is the US providing more healthcare?* [We can look at quality...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_quality_of_healthcare) the US does have a better survival rate for cancer and heart disease.  But the life expectancy [isn't better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy).  Does this imply the US *does not* spend more for end-of-life care?  [This](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2016/january/cost-of-endoflife-care-in-the) says the US spends about 20% more than Belgium, England and Netherlands, but 20% less than Canada and Norway.  I can't find anything else conclusive so I don't know about this answer.  There are also fewer hospital beds per capita [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) and fewer doctors per capita [(link)](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Health/Physicians/Per-1,000-people) than many other countries.  [This very good article](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective) says the US does use more technology and drugs, but I can't tell how much of a cost this is.

4. *Does the US spend more on medical research?*  [This](https://www.quora.com/What-countries-have-lead-the-world-in-medical-research-and-innovation-in-the-past-20-years) seems to be a well researched answer but isn't per capita.  [This map](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/search/map) shows total clinic trials.  Europe has 740 million people so I get 1 trial per 11,000 people in Europe and 1 trial per 3500 people in the US.

5. (EDIT) *Administrative costs*  I meant for this to be included in 2 but I think I didn't look into this enough.  I'm seeing numbers that are more than double now that I'm looking at it more.  While [the NHS in England spends 14%](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/mar/30/nhs-management-costs-spending) on administrative costs, looks like the US spends 30%: [link](http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/jennifer-williamson/do-we-really-spend-nearly-third-health-care-dollar/).  The discrepancy with Canada (in 1999) is even larger: [link](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa022033#t=article).  [But here's another link](http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/accounting-for-the-cost-of-us-health-care) that's only got it 38% higher ($236B vs $145B).

What kinds of policies and regulations govern how the police may respond to protests? Who sets them and who enforces them? How does the appropriate degree of force depend on the degree to which protesters are violent, damaging private property, or armed with deadly weapons? And are there specific rules about how police should subdue and disperse journalists as opposed to protesters?"

Section IV states that in the case of the impeachment of a President or Vice President, as opposed to a judge or some other official, the ""Chief Justice of the United States shall preside."" Furthermore, the Chief Justice ""shall be administered an oath by the Presiding Officer of the Senate.""

Section V dictates that the ""Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue...all orders, mandates, writs and precepts...""

Section VI then broadens the power to compel witnesses to the entire Senate: ""Senate shall have power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to enforce obedience to its orders, mandates, writs, precepts and judgments..."" 

What I'm trying to figure out is what power does Roberts have here as the Presiding Officer on the trial, what powers would McConnell or Pence have as the Presiding Officer on the Senate, and what powers would the Senate as a whole have?"
"Is there any evidence to back up the claim that creating higher tax brackets and raising income taxes on the rich would result in those people leaving the country, removing that revenue all together?","So with all the talk recently among the big names in the Democratic Party about [raising taxes on the rich](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/economy/wealth-tax-elizabeth-warren.html), and more specifically, expanding tax brackets beyond the current [~$600,000](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/) cap, concern has [again arisen among conservatives](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/why-taxing-the-rich-doesnt-work) about the efficacy of this approach.

I came across an argument the other day that argued if income taxes were to be raised on these expanded brackets, then those individuals would just [leave the country](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/will-high-taxes-force-the-rich-to-leave-america/) and/or move their assets to somewhere else, resulting in the elimination of the entirety of that tax revenue. 


I had never heard this argument before, and am very curious about its validity and where it does or doesn't hold true. "
Do President Trump's actions in respect to Ukraine constitute criminal bribery?,"Recently there have been accusations from Rep. [Jackie Speier](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/469784-speier-says-impeachment-inquiry-shows-very-strong-case-of-bribery) and the Washington Post's [Eugene Robinson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/call-trumps-crime-what-it-is-bribery/2019/11/07/58903c60-01a1-11ea-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html) that President Trump's conduct in respect to Ukraine constitutes the crime of bribery.

Both of them cite the withholding of approximately $400 million in military aid from Ukraine unless Ukraine announced an investigation of Joe Biden, a current [frontrunner](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primaries/democratic/national/) for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Robinson particularly cites to 18 USC § 201(b) which says, in relevant part:

>Whoever... being a public official or person selected to be a public official, directly or indirectly, corruptly demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity, in return for:

>>(A)being influenced in the performance of any official act; ...

>shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.

In contrast, Rep. [Andy Biggs](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-andy-biggs-lipstick-impeachment) has argued ""there is no specific 'high crime' or 'misdemeanor' committed by the president.""

The US Supreme Court heard oral arguments today in the Masterpiece Cakeshop vs. Colorado Civil Rights Commission case. What are the legal arguments for each side?,"For those unfamiliar with the case, basically a gay couple (Charlie Craig and David Mullins) came to Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado and asked the owner, Jack Phillips, to make a cake for them for their wedding. Phillips told them that although they're welcome to purchase a pre-made cake or other varieties of dessert, he will not create a cake specifically for same-sex weddings.

Craig and Mullins filed a lawsuit against Phillips for discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (""[CADA](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-24/principal-departments/article-34/part-6/section-24-34-601)""), which they won in district court. The Colorado Appellate court upheld the ruling saying that Phillips must provide custom cakes for **any** wedding, so long as he offers custom wedding cakes as a service (he has actually stopped making wedding cakes at all since this ruling, a move which he reports cost him 40% of his business and forced him to lay off half of his staff [(Source)](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/05/politics/supreme-court-masterpiece-cakeshop/index.html). 

Now, Phillips is arguing that CADA violates the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment) by compelling him to create something in conflict with his religious beliefs. 

This will surely be an important First Amendment case for the Court. What are the legal arguments in support of both sides?"
"What barriers exist to lowering the base cost of health care in the US, as opposed to reforming insurance coverage that merely funds it?","The price of health care in the US is [higher than anywhere else in the world](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/3/89.full.html).

However, very little effort seems to be expended in Washington (so far as I know or can Google) to reform the system that gives rise to those high prices, as opposed to merely funding it via the ACA, Medicare, or other legislative options.

Why should this be the case?



Edit: Unsurprisingly, this is an incredibly complex issue. Between source links and individuals' insight, you all have given me enough reading material for the next several hours. My family has higher-than-average medical costs, and coping with medical issues inside of what I perceive to be a broken system is perpetually infuriating.

What is the legality of the confinement of Gen. John Baker at Guantanamo Bay?,"Today, Colonel Vance Spath (USAF) [ordered](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article182031196.html) that General John Baker (USMC) be confined to quarters for 21 days as punishment for contempt of a military commission.  

This resulted from three lawyers for the defendant in the USS Cole case [resigning after an ethical conflict that is at least partially classified, but involved the government listening in on attorney-client privileged communications.](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/guantanamo/article178691836.html)

Gen. Baker is the chief defense counsel, and allowed the dismissal of the three civilian lawyers.  Col. Spath is the judge and objected, ordering that only he could allow their dismissal and that he did not allow it.

Gen. Baker refused to withdraw his opinion and was ordered confined for 21 days for contempt.

---

What is the legality of this detention?  Gen. Baker argued in the hearing before being cut off that the commission did not have jurisdiction over him as he was a US citizen.  Is that correct, and does it preclude Col. Spath's actions?  

Is there another provision of law that would apply?  Does it matter that Col. Spath and Gen. Baker are in different service branches, or that Gen. Baker outranks Col. Spath?"

A tax code provision used by Rep Richard Neal to compel the IRS to produce President Trump's tax returns leaves little wiggle room to deny the request.

Can the Secretary deny the request and what are the mechanics of the legal battle?,"Representative Richard Neal (D-MA) has cited [a tax code provision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) that allows [Congress to gain a hold of individual returns](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/us/politics/trump-tax-returns.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage):

> Mr. Neal made the request through an obscure but frequently used provision of the federal tax code — Section 6103 — that allows Congress’s tax-writing committees to view tax information on any filer. 

The provision is regularly used to sample filers to measure the impact of tax policy, and is sometimes used for investigative purposes too, however using it to seek the tax returns of the President without his or her consent has little* precedent. 

(Edit: Originally stated ""No precedent."" This is a transcription error. The NYTime's states ""little precedent"". /u/Adama0001 has more information on similar precedent.)

---

The President's personal lawyers have submitted a letter to Department of the Treasury asking the IRS to deny the request on the grounds that the Democrats don't have a suitable reason to seek the returns, and that the President's personal returns should be protected like any private citizen.

The request through 26 U.S. Code § 6103 leaves little wiggle room for the Treasury, specifically (from the 1st source):

> (f) Disclosure to Committees of Congress

> > (1) *Committee on Ways and Means, Committee on Finance, and Joint Committee on Taxation*

> > Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or the chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request, except that any return or return information which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer shall be furnished to such committee only when sitting in closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such disclosure.

---

I have a few questions on this topic:

1: Can the Treasury Secretary tell the IRS to deny the request, or is the code so clear the IRS must just produce the returns? 

2: If the Treasury Secretary can deny the request, must he provide a legally scrutinized justification for the denial? (Will his reasoning be the legal justification in court, or can he give a political answer?)

3: If the request for the tax returns are denied, what is the legal framing for this battle? For example, does this end up in the courts because Democrats subpoena the information, or does the codified nature of their request mean there's some non-subpoena way of resolving this issue?

The intro blurb to [this podcast](https://www.marketplace.org/2017/01/24/business/can-government-be-run-business) says making government run like a business means ""walking away from negotiations, always getting the best deal, and negotiating the lowest possible costs.""

Why are so many people from places like Central America seeking asylum in the US and how does US law apply to the waves of migrants currently trying to enter the country?,"I am trying to figure out what is going on with the mass waves of migrants traveling up to try to enter the US and seek asylum. As I understand, under [current US law](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/obtaining-asylum-united-states) migrants can seek asylum by crossing illegally and turning themselves in (common), or be caught trying to enter the US illegally. 

According to [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have), migrants seeking asylum have a right to a lawyer and due process during the whole thing. They are booked, then released on bond with a pending court date to show back up for a judge to give them the verdict on their asylum case.  Apparently the number of undocumented migrants who fail to appear on their court date rose significantly in the past few years [from 24% to ~40% between 2012 and 2016](https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/26/wolf-blitzer/majority-undocumented-immigrants-show-court-data-s/) many of whom illegally remain in the US. 

Why are migrants fleeing Central America and [rejecting offers to stay in Mexico](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-caravan-members-reject-offer-to-stay-in-mexico-no-were-heading-north-2018-10-27/)?

"The recent raid in Yemen - is it accurate that this operation was 'botched'? What are the accurate numbers of civilians killed, and could the death of the Navy SEAL have been avoided?","Most media articles I'm reading refer to the raid as botched, and point out that Trump was not present in the Situation Room, or that the plans were discussed 'over dinner'. I'm not sure that these particular details confirm the idea that the operation was 'botched', but are an attempt to highlight a lack of attention to the operation. This may or may not be accurate that the President ordered the raid without proper thought and attention, which is a difficult claim to answer. How accurate is the claim that the raid was botched - meaning to say, is this level of civilian casualties (most media reporting 'up to 30' - not giving an accurate count, perhaps due to difficulty identifying who was a civilian - according to the NYT article below, women began taking up arms against the raid) typical or avoidable? How often do our service members die in raids such as this? Is there any history of Presidents ordering such operations and not being present in the situation room - is this a departure from typical norms? Is the posting of old video by the military an attempt to control the PR situation regarding the raid?

Could President Trump pardon himself?,"The [Washington Post has reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-lawyers-seek-to-undercut-muellers-russia-investigation/2017/07/20/232ebf2c-6d71-11e7-b9e2-2056e768a7e5_story.html?hpid=hp_no-name_no-name%3Apage%2Fbreaking-news-bar&tid=a_breakingnews&utm_term=.56835249232b) that President Trump is asking his advisers about his powers as president to pardon his aides, his family members, and even himself as Special Investigator Robert Mueller's investigation expands into Trump's personal finances and his potential ties to Russia. 

From WaPO article:

>The power to pardon is granted to the president in Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution, which gives the commander in chief the power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” That means pardon authority extends to federal criminal prosecution but not to state level or impeachment inquiries.

>No president has sought to pardon himself, so no courts have reviewed it. Although Kalt says the weight of the law argues against a president pardoning himself, he says the question is open and predicts such an action would move through the courts all the way to the Supreme Court.

[U.S. Const. art. II, § 2 in full](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii)

So my question is, since the president's power to pardon himself has never been reviewed by the federal courts, what are the constitutional arguments both for and against the president having the power to pardon himself?

The US Constitution Article 2 Section 3 appears to give the president the ability to adjourn congress. Has this ever been used?,"In light of Brexit discussions on [proroguing](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-48936711) where [parliament has been suspended seemingly to prevent interference in the Brexit proceeding,](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-49604584)

Article 2 describes the powers of the executive, under section 3 it appears a number of responsibilities are listed including 

> [...he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper...](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3--2)

Is congress today ever at risk of disagreeing on what time they adjourn, and if so, has a president ever exercised their right to forcibly adjourn congress in the case of such disagreement?

Further, what prevents a party in power of at least one house and the presidency from conspiring to disagree on adjournment and let the president adjourn congress at some opportune time? Have other laws superseded and/or made this executive power irrelevant?"
What kind of legal action (if any) can foreign governments take on the US if their media personnel are assaulted?,"There have been quite a few countries that have dispatched reporters to follow the protests that are breaking out around the US.  [Several of those reporters have been assaulted](https://time.com/5846497/journalists-police-george-floyd-protests/) during these protests turned violent.

Do members of the foreign press have any protections from these instances, and if so, what kind of consequences can occur if those protections are violated?"

The reclusive state has been a foreign policy problem for the USA since the end of the Korean War in the 1950's and more so since the end of the Cold when the North Koreans began their pursuit of nuclear weapons. Presidents from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama tried different approaches to deal with them, such as diplomatic engagement, labeling it a state sponsor of terror, or simply ignoring it in hopes that the regime would collapse on its own. None of those approaches worked 

Inter-continental nuclear capability changes the nature and scale of the threat that North Korea Poses. [An article in the latest edition of the Atlantic lays out 4 broad options for dealing with North Korea](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/the-worst-problem-on-earth/528717/) 
> 1. Prevention: A crushing U.S. military strike to eliminate Pyongyang’s arsenals of mass destruction, take out its leadership, and destroy its military. 
> 2. Turning the screws: A limited conventional military attack—or more likely a continuing series of such attacks—using aerial and naval assets, and possibly including narrowly targeted Special Forces operations. 
> 3. Decapitation: Removing Kim and his inner circle, most likely by assassination, and replacing the leadership with a more moderate regime
> 4. Acceptance: The hardest pill to swallow—acquiescing to Kim’s developing the weapons he wants while continuing efforts to contain his ambition.

As the article stresses, none of these options are particularly attractive. Which leads to my question(s), how should the world deal with North Korea? "

The opioid crisis: should it be a state of emergency and if so who should handle it?,"The opioid commission wants Trump to declare a state of emergency, saying that having the President do so would bring intensity to the cause. Usually, drugs are not a cause for a state of emergency. Looking back in history, for biological reasons, it has been diseases that have caused states of emergency:

> It is not often that a public health emergency is declared for something other than a natural disaster. The US Department of Health and Human Services declared one in Puerto Rico last year after more than 10,000 Zika cases were reported there. Before that, the last emergency declaration, unrelated to a natural disaster, was during the 2009-10 flu season, when there was widespread concern over a potential pandemic.

How is Russia able to take those Ukrainian ships with The UN Law of the Sea and The Kerch Strait Agreement in place?,"On 25 November 2018 three Ukrainian Navy vessels (two gun boats and an accompanying tug boat) were attempting passage from the Black Sea through the Strait of Kerch and into the Sea of Azov. 

Prior to entering the Strait, Russian FSB border security vessels intercepted the group off the coast of Crimea, ultimately capturing the vessels and their crew- which are being held in Kerch.  

Russia asserts that their actions were permissible as the ships had illegally entered Russian territorial waters; however, coordinates offered in statements by both Ukraine and Russia indicate that the encounter occurred in international waters.  

The event has prompted Ukraine to enact martial law in border regions and restricted the entry of Russian men aged 16-60  for fear of civil unrest similar to the events  in 2014 that stemmed from Euromaidan.  


The Kerch Strait Agreement defines the strait and Sea of Azov as historically shared waters and provide for shared use by both parties and the UN Law of the Sea contains provisions for innocent passage.

Still, this wouldn't answer what is unconstitutional about the special counsel investigation, and is more oriented towards executive power and privilege. 

> The comments by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani about the legal limits of presidential power follow a report in The New York Times that the president’s lawyers had written a 20-page memorandum in January arguing that Mr. Trump could “if he wished, terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon.”

2019 UK General Election Megathread,"**I HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO CALL A CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY OF BETWEEN 360-367 SEATS**

It may seem like deja vu, but we are back with a new UK General Election, the third in five years. This is because [a snap election was called by MP's back in October](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-why-boris-johnson-brexit-vote-deal-conservatives-explained-a9201081.html) after a stalemate on the issue of Brexit - this is why it's being dubbed the 'Brexit Election.' If Boris Johnson is to win, he will be able to get Brexit deal done by the 31st.

There are all 650 seats up for grabs - that's a majority requirement of 326 seats.

Current [FT polling](https://www.ft.com/content/263615ca-d873-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17) has the Conservatives at 43%, Labour at 33%. However, with the First Past the Post electoral system, it is hard to know how this will translate into actual seats.

Whatever happens, it will be monumental and set the UK on its course for the next five years - and perhaps even more if the issue of Brexit can be resolved.

You can watch the election as it happens on [BBC news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/election-2019-50755004), or the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/12/general-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll).

[Deputy Financial Times Editor Steven Swinford](https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1205218026997596160) has stated that Conservative support in London's constituencies are looking ""difficult"", but are hoping to regain losses in the Leave-voting North of England.

**21:50:** Political Editor for the Sun Newspaper has reported that there is a [50/50 chance on a Hung Parliament/Narrow Conservative Win](https://twitter.com/tnewtondunn/status/1205242626548674563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205242626548674563&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**22:01:** The Exit Polls have come in. The Conservatives have 368 seats, with Labour on 191. SNP have 55 seats. That's a 86 majority - Margaret Thatcher levels. If that's true, that's a phenomenal result, and gives Boris is mandate to ""GET BREXIT DONE!"" by the 31st of January. 

These are not the final results, just a poll and should not be trusted completely. There is still a lot that can change.

**22:27:** Where does this leave Labour under Jeremy Corbyn? This is the worst result for Labour since 1935. There are already calls for him to resign, however his shadow cabinet are standing by him - for now.

**22:29:**[ If the 55 out of 58 SNP seats in Scotland](https://twitter.com/theSNP/status/1205246386846994441?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) is to be believed, just one shy of their all-time high in 2015, and a 20 seat gain, this will put Scotland at odds with Westminster. A hard right, Leave Conservative government would be clashing with a Remain voting Scottish Nationalist government up north - putting the state of the Union in even more jeopardy. Scotland would want a 2nd Independence Referendum, and claimed this election would give them a mandate to have one, however the Conservatives have put any notion of one away.

**22:42:** The Guardian are reporting that the exit polls suggest that Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson is set to lose her seat in East Dumbartonshire, Scotland.

**22:46:** [The Pound has climbed against the Dollar](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-pound-wins-as-exit-poll-predicts-big-tory-majority-11884813) and the Euro by almost as much as 5 cents as the exit polls came in, citing stability in the UK political climate and a clearer future. This may also harm the attack that many Remainers used that leaving the EU would harm the UK economy.

**23:17:** Labour's heartlands in the Midlands - the so called Red Wall - is apparently swinging hard to the Conservatives, which is where many of these gains are likely to come from.

**23:26** The traditional race to get the first results are in from Newcastle Central. The results are Con: 9,290  Lab: 21,568 Lib: 2709 Green: 1,365 BXP: 2542. This seat was a Leave voting seat, but the Labour candidate was re-elected by a majority of over 12,000, but this is a 7% loss from 2017.

**23:34** In Sunderland South, Labour lost [18% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000754), and Blyth swung from Labour to Tory after they lost [15% of votes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000575). These are all traditional Labour seats - and many were narrow vote Leave seats.

**00:32**[ Swindon North hold for Conservatives](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000851). Doubled Labour's vote. Labour are down 8% here.

**01:03** A Labour seat that they won by over 10k votes in 2017 has [gone to a recount](https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1205289992840458241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205289992840458241&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This does not look good for the Labour Party.

**01:40** So far, Conservatives have gained 3 seats, SNP gained 1 seat, and Labour have lost 4 seats. We have only just begun. However, if these numbers are to be believed, the Exit Poll seems to be more or less accurate.

**02:03:** The first Labour gain has come in from Putney. The gain [has given Labour a 6% lead](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205304811979182080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205304811979182080&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll). This is a London seat and was expected to swing to Labour.

**02:32:** Results so far - 52 Conservatives, 47 Labour, 7 Scottish Nationalists, 1 Liberal Democrats, 5 ""OTHERS"".

**02:46:** Results so far - 78 Con, 68 Lab, 13 SNP, 1 Lib Dem, 5 ""Others""

Currently, Labour has lost, on average, a share of votes of around 10%. This is almost historic. Most swings are between 2-4%. Tony Blair only surpassed this with a 15% swing in favour in 1998

**02:58** Chuka Unama, a former Conservative who joined the Liberal Democrats, [has lost his seat to the Conservaitves.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000639) This comes after both Labour and Liberal Democrats - a self proclaimed Remain alliance - ended up splitting the vote. If they voted tactically, they would have won by more than 6k votes.

**03:09:** DUP's Deputy Leader, Nigel Dodds, has lost [his seat to Sinn Fein](https://www.itv.com/news/utv/2019-12-13/live-counting-underway-at-centres-across-ni/)

**03:19:** Liberal Democrats [gained a Conservative seat, the first of the night](https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1205325042067935232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1205325042067935232&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2019%2Fdec%2F12%2Fgeneral-election-2019-uk-live-labour-tories-corbyn-boris-johnson-results-exit-poll)

**03:35** It is expected that Jeremy Corbyn is going to stand down after this election, after stating that he ""will not lead the Labour Party into another General Election""

**03:52** Jo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has lost [her seat to the SNP by just over 100 seats](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50771123). It will be expected for her to resign, and a new leader to be elected - the fourth in the past 2 years.

It seems as though Senate Republicans just suspend the rules about suspending committee rules. Is that what actually happened?,"And if so, what's the larger framework for making that possible?  Here's where they [suspended the rules](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/republicans-vote-to-suspend-committee-rules-advance-mnuchin-price-nominations/index.html?adkey=bn).  This seems to be the [rule about suspending the rules](http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleV).  

The language I'm curious about is in bold.  

""1. No motion to suspend, modify, or amend any rule, or any part thereof, shall be in order, **except on one day's notice in writing, specifying precisely the rule or part proposed to be suspended**, modified, or amended, and the purpose thereof. Any rule may be suspended without notice by the **unanimous consent of the Senate**, except as otherwise provided by the rules.""

Was 1 day written notice provided? and if so, to and from whom?  Was there unanimous consent of the (entire?) Senate? "
"How can a former US President be indicted, arrested, and prosecuted?","Yesterday in the Congressional testimony of Robert Mueller, the former Special Counsel repeatedly said that the his office was not empowered to determine whether the president obstructed justice because of Department of Justice policy that the Department cannot indict the current president. However, [Mueller said that the president can be indicted after leaving office](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/24/robert-mueller-donald-trump-can-charged-after-leaving-office/1814190001/). And in detailed questioning, [Mueller agreed that all of the three requirements for obstruction charges were met](https://news.yahoo.com/mueller-edges-closer-to-saying-trump-committed-obstruction-160919062.html). Beyond the Mueller case, the president's  former personal lawyer [is currently in prison for crimes that he says the president directed him to commit](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/14/michael-cohen-gma-interview-trump/2309268002/), and [new evidence supports the president's involvement in those crimes](https://news.yahoo.com/michael-cohen-says-trump-directed-142437206.html). So it seems very likely that a prosecutor could pursue an indictment of the president if not for the DOJ policy, and that policy is valid only as long as the president remains in office. What procedures take effect after that?

In particular,

* How soon can it happen? Even if the prosecutors begin preparing a case in November, as soon as the election result shows that the sitting president is about to leave office, do they have to wait until he formally leaves office in January before they can convene a grand jury to consider an indictment? Or could they be ready to serve an indictment the moment the next president takes the oath of office? Or is every US Attorney obligated by ethics or policy to leave that matter to his or her successor if the incoming president chooses to appoint a new one?
* [Former presidents are guaranteed Secret Service protection for life](https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/01/10/obama-secret-service-lifetime-protection-bush/1823961/); can the former president direct the Secret Service to block authorities who are trying to execute a lawful arrest warrant? Can anyone else direct the Secret Service to stand down?
* If the former president relocates to a country with no extradition treaty, can he or she keep Secret Service protection there? Or is anyone involved in the relocation potentially guilty of aiding a fugitive?
* [The statute of limitations for some crimes in question requires charges to be filed within five years.](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-2020-win-could-run-out-clock-on-obstruction) If the president is re-elected and that clock therefore runs out in his or her second term, can prosecutors still argue that the statute of limitations is suspended (""tolled"") while the president is in office and immune to prosecution? Are there other likely charges with longer statutes of limitations? Might the tolling question be decided differently for state charges instead of federal charges?
* Before he was [pardoned by his successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon_of_Richard_Nixon), did prosecutors make these kinds of plans to indict former president Richard Nixon?
* What influence does the new president have over the possible prosecution of his or her predecessor? As we enter a new election cycle, have any candidates expressed a position on this?

Is the Trump administrations proposed cutting of security aid to Pakistan justified?,"[According to the New York Times, the Trump administration has decided to cut a considerable amount of the security aid given to Pakistan, likely based on President Trump's position that Pakistan gives ""safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror.""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/us/politics/trump-pakistan-aid.html)

[It is almost universally accepted that the Taliban exist in some form, within the boundaries of Pakistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehrik-i-Taliban_Pakistan) However, is their presence due to Pakistan governments inability or reluctance to eradicate them? In other words, does Trump's motive hold merit?"
What measures are there to prevent a single Senator from holding up actions that have bi-partisan support?,"The House almost unanimously passed a resolution yesterday requesting the public release of the Mueller report, yet a single senator blocked the Senate from voting on it. What measures are there preventing a single senator from holding up resolutions or legislation from being voted on, and are non-binding resolutions treated the same way as legislation in this regard?

"Are China's trade policies unfair to the US, and if so, to what degree are they to blame for US economic problems?","There has been an escalating [war of words between the US and China over trade policies and potential tariffs.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-threatens-tariffs-on-100-billion-more-china-goods-beijing-ready-to-strike-back-idUSKCN1HD0NW)

[This article](https://www.theepochtimes.com/why-trade-with-china-is-not-free_2320640.html) lays out the case for how China's trade policies  have unfairly damaged the US economy and why the tactics of previous US administrations have failed to stem the losses. Among other points, it asserts that since accession to the WTO, China's subsidies, currency manipulation and high tariffs have ballooned the trade deficit and cost millions of American jobs.

On the other hand, economists widely agree that [the benefits of free trade outweigh the costs.](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/free-trade) Previous experiments with trade sanctions have [temporarily preserved small numbers of jobs at a huge cost to US consumers.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-tariffs-has-the-u-s-tried-in-the-past-and-how-did-they-work-out/)

Questions:

* Are China's trade policies widely regarded as ""unfair""?
* Have those policies caused the widening trade deficit and/or a decline in US jobs?
* To what degree have China's trade policies affected the wider US economy, both positively and negatively?

"[META] Welcome to our new 5,000 subscribers and New FAQ","Hello Neutrons-

Over the last few days we have taken in around 5,000 subscribers.  As we usually do when we gain a lot of new subscribers we wanted to take the time to post about our rules.  We also decided to update our FAQ so I will use this opportunity to do two things.  Post our new FAQ and welcome our new subscribers.  We are now at 132,000+ neutrons.  

Thank you all!

-----

**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

At this subreddit, we want to allow people who disagree on something to work it out between themselves in the interest of mutual understanding. If understanding truly cannot be reached (which is sometimes the case), we recommend that the conversation only continue as long both sides maintain decorum and feel that they are benefiting from the interaction. The mods will allow you to debate as long as it is civil, but sometimes it is best to part ways with a respectful “Good day, sir”. The choice lies in your good judgment.

Finally, try your best in a conversation to understand the other person’s perspective and determine rationally whether it makes sense. Take time to consider what they are saying. **Do not read a reply with the assumption that the other person is wrong**. Look for points that make sense and acknowledge them. Look for points that you can disprove and lay out your counterargument and evidence. Through this attitude, your discussion can be constructive and informative for both parties involved.

-----

**So you’re personally not politically neutral? Well…can I still make Futurama jokes?**

I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

-----

**Are world events allowed, or is r/NeutralPolitics region specific?**

Our subreddit has a global scope, and the politics of any region is equally valued for conversation. Keep in mind, though, that if not many other redditors are located in the region that you are posting about, we won’t necessarily understand your topic. If that’s the case, make sure to post informative links so that we could all get a chance to learn more and then discuss it. 

-----

**I want to post a news article that I saw on a larger subreddit. Is that okay?**

Conversations on the larger political subreddits can often be disappointing, so it is perfectly acceptable to repost a news article here. In fact, it is encouraged! The goal is for r/NeutralPolitics to be a legitimate alternative to other political discussion subreddits, and that means that we need more than just discussion - we need current events, too. Just remember two things: use a different source for the story if the linked content is heavily biased or overly emotional and avoid copying the post title unless you have verified that it meets our standards.  Also we ask that you remove the references to the other subreddit, we don't really need a meta discussion about the other sub in question. 

-----

**There sure is a lot of weight placed on evidence and information here. Why is that?**

When discussing practical political issues, it is easy to get involved in emotional arguments and assumptions. By emphasizing that your argument is only as good as the data and/or logic that supports it, we remove the emotional element that leads to bickering and flame wars. It is much easier to argue information than it is to argue feelings, and we walk away from the former not angry, but with a better understanding of the world around us. **The goal here isn’t to prove that you are right.** It is to find out if you are right. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t defend your position, but it does mean that you should acknowledge when you have been presented with enough logical evidence to bring that position into question.

-----

**What kind of evidence should I use?**

We also have created a [guide to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5qe3vg/a_resource_guide_for_building_your_factbased/).

-----

**What types of posts should I report?**

Most people associate the report button with someone breaking a rule. However, at r/NeutralPolitics we encourage that you report a post if there is any reason at all that a moderator should look at it. We won’t be able to necessarily catch everything, so we need your help to keep the standards of discussion for the community high. In addition to anything that breaks the /r/NeutralPoilitics & Reddit wide rules, report a post if it:

* Contains memes, spam, or is otherwise devoid of meaningful content
* Insults another user or says something that makes a hostile environment for discussion
* Doesn’t break any rules, but could use some constructive input 
* Cites a source that you think should be saved for posterity in the r/NeutralPolitics archive

Please don't report the following:

* You feel the comment isn't Neutral, note this isn't a requirement as long as the comment has sources for facts presented
* You feel the sources are biased, the answer to this is to respond with better sources, or with sources showing why that source can't be trusted. [Here is a good example](https://np.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5uv7ov/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_us_building_a/ddy0lt1/)

-----

**I’m an expert in a field relevant to this community, such as political science, economics, or statistics. Can I get flair?**

We don't give flair because we find it places an undue emphasis on the 'expert'.  It should be easier for any expert on a subject to find relevant sources and link or reference them.  

-----

**What do I do if I have a problem with a moderator?**

If a moderator is behaving inappropriately, [contact the mod team at large](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) privately with your concerns and one of us/all of us will be happy to discuss it with you.

**Surveys/Questions on Demographics/Breakdown by Party Affiliation**

We sometimes get requests to present data on the demographics of this sub, or someone saying they can't accurately gauge the ideas presented without some sort of demographic breakdown.  We do not do surveys, they are explicitly disallowed by our guidelines.  Again the qualifications for a good comment/post are: *""We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.""*

"Since the Senate required 60 votes to the pass the motion to bring the 3rd coronavirus bill to the floor, is there a procedural/process reason for why Sen. Mitch McConnell voted against the motion making it a 47-47 tie?","[https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-stimulus-congress-141360](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/22/coronavirus-stimulus-congress-141360)

The 3rd coronavirus bill was stopped on 3/22/2020 after the Senate fell short of the 60 votes needed to stop debate and vote on the bill. The bill would have provided relief measures intended to help the American people during the coronavirus crisis. However, Democrats argued that the bill had major flaws, and so unanimously voted against the motion to bring the bill to a full Senate floor vote.

The [motion](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&session=2&vote=00077) was rejected by a 47-47 tie, as it needed a minimum of 60 votes to pass. Mitch McConnell was the only Republican to vote nay on the motion. According to the [video](https://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=3646) of the Senate proceedings for 3/22/2020, Mr. McConnell's vote happens at roughly 5 hours and 36 minutes into the clip, which happens to be the last vote on the motion. So my question is, are there any procedural/process reasons for making the motion a tie as opposed to being a 48-46?"

Is there evidence that military style hardware improves policing outcomes?,"AG Sessions recently [lifted a ban](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/28/546743742/trump-administration-lifts-limits-on-military-hardware-for-police) on the donation of surplus military hardware to police departments. The ban had been implemented in the wake of Ferguson by the Obama administration, which argued that the equipment gave the impression of law enforcement as a hostile occupying force instead of a community policing effort. AG Sessions disputes this view and believes that the hardware is necessary to protect officers and deter crime. 

Is there evidence to support or refute the idea that military hardware makes communities or police officers safer, or reduces crime?

EDIT: As I've learned more about the issue, I realize that my original summary was somewhat inaccurate. Here is a [more precise summary](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/05/18/obama-moves-to-demilitarize-americas-police/), from 2015, of the policy that has just been repealed:

>The [Obama] policy will stop “tanks and other tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, firearms and ammunition measuring .50-caliber and larger, grenade launchers and bayonets” from being given to local police agencies.

>Additionally, the [Obama] policy would attach some restrictions and conditions to the transfer of other equipment, “including armored tactical vehicles like those used in Ferguson, as well as many types of firearms, ammunition and explosives.” These restrictions include requiring the agencies to present “a clear and persuasive explanation of the need for the controlled equipment,” adopt community-oriented policing strategies, agree to “close federal oversight and monitoring overseen by a new federal agency with the power to conduct local compliance reviews,” train officers who will be using the gear, and keep data on how the equipment is used and with what results."

What does Trump's Religious Freedom Executive Order actually accomplish?,"Source for the EO: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/04/presidential-executive-order-promoting-free-speech-and-religious-liberty


When reading this over, nothing really concrete stood out to me that this EO was really accomplishing. Maybe I missed some of the nuance or how this EO will play with existing laws?

Section 2 says this: ""In particular, the Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure, to the extent permitted by law, that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against any individual, house of worship, or other religious organization on the basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral or political issues from a religious perspective, where speech of similar character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation or intervention in a political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate for public office by the Department of the Treasury""
Maybe I'm getting lost on the long sentence structure, but it sounds like it's saying the DoT will not take adverse action against religious organizations when they talk about politics where that speech is not ordinarily treated as political campaigning. But it also says consistent with law. So what does that really mean? Isn't it already against the law for religious organizations to use funds to campaign? So what does this section really change?

Section 3 (Conscience Protections with Respect to Preventive-Care Mandate) seemed the most concrete, but the language is written as ""shall consider"" - meaning that they don't have to implement anything from this EO. 

Section 4 just seems to be ""hey guys remember the first amendment when looking at laws, kthx""

Surely I seem to be missing something important here. "

* The [White House directed a former security clearance official Carl Kline not to testify before the House Oversight committee despite a subpoena.](https://www.lawfareblog.com/documents-white-house-orders-former-official-defy-congressional-subpoena-congress-responds)  Kline [wrote the committee](https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/documents/eLtr.%20to%20Cummings%20and%20Jordan%2020190422.pdf) to say he would not comply with their subpoena due to the White House request.

* Donald Trump in his personal capacity sued [the House Oversight committee and his accounting firm](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-trump-sues-house-oversight-chairman-and-accounting-firm-over-tax-returns) to prevent his accounting firm from turning over financial records to the Oversight committee pursuant to a subpoena.

* DoJ civil rights division official [John Gore](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/justice-department-refuses-to-comply-with-congressional-subpoena-for-testimony-on-citizenship-question-and-2020-census/2019/04/24/d132996a-66a6-11e9-a1b6-b29b90efa879_story.html) told the Oversight committee yesterday he would not attend a deposition he was subpoenaed to attend related to the citizenship question on the 2020 census.

* The Treasury Department [said they would not yet turn over Trump's tax returns under 26 USC 6103(f)](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Secretary-Mnuchin-Response-to-Chairman-Neal-Plus-Appendix-A.pdf) after the Ways and Means Committee invoked that statutory authority to demand them [earlier this month.](https://waysandmeans.house.gov/sites/democrats.waysandmeans.house.gov/files/documents/Neal%20Letter%20to%20Rettig%20(signed\)%20-%202019.04.03.pdf) 

* The White House directed former White House counsel Don McGahn [not to testify to the House Judiciary committee under a subpoena about matters he discussed with Mueller and which appeared in Mueller's report.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-plans-to-fight-house-subpoena-of-former-counsel-donald-mcgahn-for-testimony-on-mueller-report/2019/04/23/2d48732a-65f1-11e9-83df-04f4d124151f_story.html)

* President Trump has publicly commented that [he intends to fight ""all"" House subpoenas.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/donald-trump-subpoenas.html)

Given all of these disputes, I have the following questions:

* **What are the legal merits of the particular refusals to comply listed above?**

* **Is there any precedent for the executive branch to categorically ignore or defy all subpoenas from Congress regardless of subject matter?**

* **What means does the House have at its disposal to compel enforcement of subpoenas and other statutory document requests?**

"What are the Pros, Cons, or Consequences of Shutting down the U.S. Southern Border?","4 Days ago President Trump threatened to shut down the border and made various comments on the subject:

[*""If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.

The ACA/Obamacare and the GOP's alternatives,"With the senate voting yesterday to introduce a resolution that could begin the repeal of the ACA, it'd be good to discuss the benefits, costs, and effectiveness of the ACA as compared to alternative proposals, while recognizing the GOP has not formally coalesced around one single plan. 

The [ACA](https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-law/) was created to control healthcare costs by expanding insurance coverage (through Medicaid expansion and the individual mandate + insurance marketplace), and to tie healthcare costs to patient outcomes by changing how Medicare pays doctors. 

Its [provisions include](http://kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/summary-of-the-affordable-care-act/): limits on age rating, pre-existing condition protection, staying on parents' policies up to age 26, cost-sharing subsidies, and contraceptive coverage. Congress can repeal the following provisions through budget reconciliation: medicaid expansion, premium subsidies, and the employer and individual mandates. This is where most Congressional Republican replacement proposals have focused their efforts. 

The current front-runners for GOP replacements appear to be:

* Paul Ryan's [A Better Way](https://abetterway.speaker.gov/_assets/pdf/ABetterWay-HealthCare-PolicyPaper.pdf) 

* Orrin Hatch's [Patient CARE Act](http://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Patient%20Choice,%20Affordability,%20Responsibility,%20and%20Empowerment%20Act.pdf)

* Tom Price's [Empowering Patients First Act](http://tomprice.house.gov/sites/tomprice.house.gov/files/HR%202300%20Empowering%20Patients%20First%20Act%202015.pdf)

Some common components of these plans include re-regulating the individual market to make premiums cheaper for younger individuals (by offering less benefits) and more expensive for older ones, protecting pre-existing conditions if continuous coverage is maintained, offering high-risk pools as a safety-net, changing Medicaid funding, and capping the tax-exclusion for insurance through employers.

1) How effective might the elements of these plans be with regards to creating affordable premiums, encouraging insurance companies to offer competitive plans, and reducing the underinsure population? 

2) If similar plans have been tried before anywhere, what were their outcomes? 

3) If these measures aren't effective at increasing coverage and reducing costs, what policy changes would be? (irrespective of their feasibility in the current political climate)"

That system logs all removals, distinguishing of comments, bans, and other relevant information.

**New ban policies**

As most of you have hopefully not noticed, we implemented a new ban policy recently.  The system works on a series of escalating bans (2 day, 14 day, permanent) for repeat violations of rule 1.  The gist of it is that it takes 3 or more violations in 6 months to trigger a ban discussion, and 3 mods need to sign off on a ban.

Did fake news affect the outcome of the US election?,"Even prior to the recent US presidential election, there was a lot of [talk about the influence of *fake news.*](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/business/media/medias-next-challenge-overcoming-the-threat-of-fake-news.html?_r=0) And afterwards, news organizations [tracked down the sources](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/12/02/504155809/episode-739-finding-the-fake-news-king) of fake news and discussed the [failed efforts to curtail it.](https://gizmodo.com/facebooks-fight-against-fake-news-was-undercut-by-fear-1788808204)

Surveys of voters show that [a large percentage of people believe news stories that are demonstrably false, even when those people are confident in their own ability to distinguish the real news from the fake.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/brettedkins/2016/12/20/americans-believe-they-can-detect-fake-news-studies-show-they-cant/#34ccfacd54a4)

On the other hand, Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook — one of the main promotional channels for fake news — [called the idea of it influencing the election ""pretty crazy.""](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/11/10/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-didnt-sway-election/93622620/) More importantly, the fact that [the ""rust belt"" states swung the election toward the Republican](http://www.cleveland.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/donald_trump_flipped_rust_belt.html) this year implies that people [voted according to their economic interests,](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/21/disaffected-rust-belt-voters-embraced-donald-trump-midwestern-obama) not because they believed untrue allegations about Hillary Clinton. To my thinking, this calls into question the whole idea of fake news really affecting the outcome.

So, **is there evidence that ties voting patterns in key states or demographics to a belief in fake news stories?** Is there a correlation between voter belief in fake news and turnout, such that those who believed fake news favorable to Trump were more likely to show up to the polls? 

Clearly, it would be good if the electorate made all its choices based purely on the facts, so I'm not suggesting that fake news isn't a problem. But I'd like to understand how big an influence it actually had on the electoral outcome.

**EDIT:** A lot of the responses are focusing on whether specific stories were or weren't examples of fake news. That's not the purpose of this post, though it does reveal part of the problem: we can't agree on what is fake or how to make that determination. Still, it's a topic for another post. For this discussion, I've bolded my main question above."
Are there any measurable impacts of modern political satire?,"Since the election of Trump, our appetite for news has done nothing but grow. [In fact, Americans spent almost 2 more hours consuming news during the 2016 election cycle than they did during the 2012 cycle.](http://fortune.com/2017/04/03/nielsen-news-report/)

Regardless of how these statistics are interpreted, the political news business is booming in the age of Trump. This can be seen especially clear within the success of political satire, and comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and John Oliver.

- After leaving The Daily Show, earning massive success on the Colbert Report, and taking over The Late Show, [host Stephen Colbert now averages 3.2 million viewers per night.]( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-stephen-colberts-winning-streak-hits-7-weeks-987663)

What is the policy viability of a US state implementing a universal or single-payer healthcare system?,"With the current debate over the future of [the ACA](http://www.healthline.com/health/consumer-healthcare-guide/how-does-the-affordable-care-act-work#2) and the Republican-proposed [AHCA,](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/what-we-know-about-the-american-health-care-act/525426/) there has been discussion around the idea of one or more states implementing universal healthcare systems on a state level.

There is currently [legislation in California](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-single-payer-healthcare-20170426-story.html) regarding a statewide single-payer system.  Vermont had between 2010 and 2014 worked on creating such a program, [but abandoned the project in 2014.](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1501050#t=article)

This model would parallel the manner in which Canada's single payer system was developed, which [began in Saskatchewan as a single province's hospital insurance scheme,](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/healthc.pdf) and, despite [significant pushback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_doctors%27_strike) at the time, it eventually became the model which was adopted by all Canadian provinces.

So, what is the viability of copying the Canadian model by a US state?  In particular, what sort of a tax scheme would be necessary to support it, and what incentives would it give providers and patients?"
"‘First to Invent’ patent policy was replaced by ‘First Inventor to File’ in 2013, what has changed?","The ‘First Inventor to File’ (FITF) provision of the [Leahy-Smith America Invents Act] (https://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/bills-112hr1249enr.pdf) (Pg. 2) became effective on March 16th, 2013.

How does the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone compare to historical nonhierarchical or anarchist collectives?,"In Seattle demonstrators have [taken over a small area in and around a police station](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/06/12/seattle-protest-chaz-capitol-hill-autonomous-zone-police-free/3173968001/) in the Capitol Hill area.  They have dubbed it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ).

I am wondering how this compares to some past historical examples of nonhierarchical or anarchist collectives.  A few possible comparisons:

[The Paris Commune (1871)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune)

What are the advantages and disadvantages of unconditionally allowing people to vote by mail?,"In light of social-distancing necessities for the ongoing global pandemic, some in the US are [now calling](https://time.com/5808041/coronavirus-vote-by-mail/) for more states to allow citizens to vote in elections by mailing in their ballots instead of going to a polling place, without requiring a valid excuse why they're unable to go to a polling place like absentee voting. What advantages does unconditional voting by mail bring, and at what cost?

More specifically,

* Even without a virus to worry about, are there groups of people who are inherently more likely to vote if they can do it by mail than if they have to go to a polling place?
* Does voting by mail pose a greater risk of voting fraud?
* Are there any estimates of the short-run cost and time to switch to the new system, or the long-run cost of operating that way?
* What are the results in places that have already adopted unconditional voting by mail, or those that have 100% voting by mail and no polling places at all?"
"The statistical methodology used in 2019 in the Supreme Court to argue against gerrymandering is markedly different than the 2017 'efficiency gap' method. How specifically are these statistical analyses different, and what were their respective determinations on gerrymandering?","A 2004 gerrymandering case, [Vieth v. Jubelirer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vieth_v._Jubelirer), concluded with a suggestion from now retired Justice Kennedy that perhaps there could be a measurement system to determine when political gerrymandering [had gone too far](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-election/justice-kennedy-on-hot-seat-in-major-voting-rights-case-idUSKCN1C81P2):

> Kennedy parted with his conservative colleagues to suggest that if partisan gerrymandering went too far, violating the Constitution, courts may have to step in if a “workable standard” for deciding when to do that could be found.

This was relevant in a case argued in 2017, [Gill v. Whitford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_v._Whitford), where an [efficiency gap](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/courts-law/gerrymander/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.e119295bb0fa) method was used to measure political gerrymandering. 

The 'efficiency gap' method was ultimately not a suitable standard, even though it may have measured the political gerrymandering effect just fine, because it didn't suitably demonstrate [individual harm to voters](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/supreme-court-gerrymandering-decision/index.html), and therefore the plaintiffs didn't have standing based on that model:

> The court opted instead to send the case back to the lower court so the challengers might have another chance to ""prove concrete and particularized injuries"" by showing there had been a burden on their individual votes. That showing, in turn, would allow the challengers to proceed to the merits of the case.

2019 and a political gerrymandering is at the [Supreme Court again](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/26/supreme-court-takes-gerrymandering-testing-n-c-maryland-maps/3236039002/). 

This time, the court will be looking at two maps: one gerrymandered to give Republicans 10 out of 13 seats in North Carolina, and a second to give Democrats 7 out of 8 seats in Maryland.

While the arguments against these maps go beyond statistical analysis, it's notable a different method from the 'efficiency gap' is being used for the math side [in these arguments](https://theconversation.com/want-to-fix-gerrymandering-then-the-supreme-court-needs-to-listen-to-mathematicians-114345):

> The answer to such objections, adeptly addressed in an amicus brief by MIT’s Eric Lander, is twofold. First, the maps being challenged are so biased that they are extreme outliers. They would show up as anomalies under any test for partisanship. So there is no need for the Supreme Court to set a numerical cutoff level at this stage – though a threshold may, indeed, evolve in the future. Secondly, such an extreme outlier approach is already an indispensable tool in several areas of national importance. For example, it is used to test nuclear safety, predict hurricanes and assess the health of financial institutions.

---

I have a few questions on this topic:

1: Specifically, how is the newer 'outlier' methodology different from the 'efficiency gap' analysis?

2: Do they come to different determination in severity of gerrymandering/how do they represent the severity?

3: The 'efficiency gap' method was said not to demonstrate individual voter harm by Justice Kennedy. Does the 'outlier' method potentially show individual voter harm from gerrymandering?"

Can the President forgive student debt?,"I saw [this article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-memo-to-eliminate-disabled-veterans-student-loan-debt/) today, President Trump signed a memo ordering the US Dept. of Education to forgive all federal student loans/debt for disabled veterans. Given that many of the Democratic candidates running for President have their own plans for student loan cancellation (most notably [Sen. Warren](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/24/elizabeth-warren-2020-student-loan-debt-1428361) and [Sen. Sanders](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/24/bernie-sanders-2020-student-loan-debt-forgiveness-plan-1296863)) it leads to me question whether proposed plans for student loan forgiveness for all borrowers can be implemented and enforced in a similar fashion.

My Questions:

* What are the legal paths and executive powers that a sitting president can use without congressional legislation to forgive any amount of student debt?
* Are there prior examples of US Presidents forgiving student loan debt that did not require congressional approval?

Edit: After some more diving, I found not all news sources mentioned this, but [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/21/753213306/trump-signs-executive-order-forgiving-all-federal-student-loan-debt-for-disabled) gave a good explanation, there is an existing student loan forgiveness program for disabled veterans where this stems from.  Since the president did act within his power, could that be extended to other programs such as the [Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service)?

Any Green political party with any influence (whether it is from the U.K, Taiwan or Brazil) is a member of the global Greens movement and holds the same beliefs and policies with little deviation.


However, it doesn't really explain why the stance on nuclear power is such a core tenet of Green politics though.

&nbsp;

So there's really a few questions:

&nbsp;

Why is the anti-nuclear movement so strongly correlated with Green political parties to the point that there's no notable Green/pro-environmental Parties that have a different stance on nuclear power?

Is it because an anti-nuclear stance is a law of nature for pro-environmental groups?  Or is it simply the consequence that coalition/consensus building must inevitably involve anti-nuclear issues?  Because this trend is remarkably consistent.

&nbsp;

Is there any exceptions to this rule?"

"What is the exact definition of ""election interference"" and what US Law makes this illegal?","There have been widespread allegations of Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Director of National Intelligence, in January 2017, produced a report which alleged that:

Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.

What are the pros and cons of the two bills proposed today regarding protecting the Special Counsel?,"[Two different bills were introduced today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/08/03/senators-seek-protect-special-counsels-through-legislation/537405001/) by different bipartisan groups of Senators which would provide statutory protection against the termination of a special counsel, in particular aiming at protecting Robert Mueller.

The first, introduced by [Sens. Graham and Booker](https://www.scribd.com/document/355454481/Special-Counsel-Independence-Protection-Act) would require pre-emptive judicial review of any removal of a special counsel.

The second, introduced by [Sens. Tillis and Coons](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/8/tillis-coons-introduce-the-special-counsel-integrity-act) would allow a terminated special counsel to bring a court action to restore them to their position and would require expedited disposition of that court action.

I did a little research and the closest I could find in terms of precedent was [Powell vs McCormack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_v._McCormack), where an elected Representative was asked to abstain from taking the oath of office because he was embroiled in legal troubles. As a result there was a complicated multiple-court battle that prompted a new law being brought in to better handle contested elections.

What is the legal reasoning a State could use to justify excluding a Presidential candidate, particularly one who had already been elected once, had been nominated for a a second run, and wasn't excluded from other states, from their Presidential ballot? What challenges could Trump and other lawmakers use to counter this?

Moreover, does complicating the process of voting for a candidate by essentially forcing voters to put him/her as a write-in (potentially dissuading voters from voting in the first place and likely damaging the candidate's party's downballot votes) count as voter supression?"
What legal consequences can a sitting POTUS be subject to if s/he engages in slander or libel?,"[There was a recent post in this forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5xhbef/president_trump_has_accused_fmr_president_obama/) opening a discussion about Donald Trump's claims that Barack Obama while POTUS ordered a wiretap on Trump tower.

What are the legal differences between the Pennsylvania lockdown that SCOTUS supported and the Wisconsin lockdown that their state Supreme Court struck down?,"Here's the situation I'm curious about:

Does the footage of Daniel Shavers' killing point to a need for stricter gun control?,"[Video was released recently](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/10/us/arizona-jury-acquits-ex-cop-of-murder/index.html) of the final moments of Daniel Shaver's life, a Texas man who was shot dead by Mesa, AZ police while sobbing and begging for his life. In it, Sergeant Charles Langley [barks a series of commands at the 26-year-old Shaver] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/12/08/graphic-video-shows-daniel-shaver-sobbing-and-begging-officer-for-his-life-before-2016-shooting/) including, at various times, to shut up, lay down prone, cross his legs, put his hands straight up, and crawl forward. A clearly terrified Shaver appears to be attempting to comply with the orders but is admonished several times including being told at one point  “you do that again, we’re shooting you. Do you understand?” Though, in retrospect, it's not at all clear Shaver understood what ""that"" was referring to.

After a series of commands that lasted nearly five minutes ([during which observers suggest the police had several opportunities to cuff Shaver and end the stand-off](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/8/16752914/police-arizona-philip-brailsford-daniel-shaver)), Officer Phillip Brailsford interpreted a gesture from Shaver toward his wasteband to be aggressive, and shot him five times, behavior which resulted his [leaving the police force](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2017/12/06/trial-ex-mesa-arizona-cop-shooting-nashville-native-heads-into-deliberations/926217001/) but, nonetheless [did not lead to his conviction of the subsequent murder charge](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa-breaking/2017/12/07/philip-brailsford-verdict-daniel-shaver-killing/927052001/).

The [vast majority of responses from observers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=daniel%20shaver&src=tyah) express horror at the act itself or how harshly Shaver was treated prior to the officer opening fire or both.

A commentary from a fellow officer (in a different police department) on the Blaze acquiesces to the notion that [Brailsford committed a crime (though he insists manslaughter and not murder is the more appropriate charge)](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/14/commentary-im-a-law-enforcement-officer-what-happened-to-daniel-shaver-was-a-crime), but says that much of the behavior prior to the shooting itself was justified and complied with general principles of how police should handle such a circumstance. However, other onlookers have pointed out that [Shaver indicated multiple times his desire to comply](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-mesa-arizona-police-shooting-20171208-story.html), responding, at one point, “I’m trying to do what you say."" The events that unfolded have been described by some onlookers as [an avoidable execution](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/opinions/daniel-shaver-shooting-opinion-gagliano/index.html).

Irrespective of one's opinion of this case, this is an instance of the state taking a life when the suspect in question was unarmed, and, in retrospect, [had likely not even committed a crime](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/). The Huffington Post, after the video, has asserted one possible policy remedy for preventing occurrences like this in the future: [disarming the police](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disarming-the-police-would-have-prevented-daniel-shavers_us_5a3438a4e4b02bd1c8c6069c). Other work, by Aaron Kovisto in the American Journal of Public Health suggests the more effective remedy may point the other way: [police shootings are less common in jurisdictions with stricter gun control](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303770). This implies incidents like the one involving Shaver would be less common (possibly far less common) if police were not forced to assume that nearly every suspect they encounter were armed with deadly and easily hidden weapons. In other words, [if scared police officers are scary](http://reason.com/archives/2017/12/13/scared-cops-are-scary), perhaps society should take steps to make sure police officers are operating in a less scary environment.

This post takes as a given the notion that police shootings of unarmed citizens is a serious public problem. As such, given that premise, does a policy response that disarms or reduces the armaments of police officers and/or civilians make sense to reduce police shootings of citizens? If not, why not? Would other responses to this issue be more appropriate or more effective? If so, what?"

What are the public policy benefits of the US memorializing slavery the way Germany memorializes the Holocaust?,"The [traditional question](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-debate-over-confederate-monuments-and-how-to-remember-the-civil-war) America has to answer is the place of Civil War statues and their public homage to that conflict. They arguably lionize secession and slavery, not necessarily in that order. The counterpoint is that they also make it difficult for Americans to forget important and violent divisions that nearly tore apart the country. 

In Germany, they likewise have a violent and disturbing history: the Holocaust. They're not direct parallels, particularly since the Nazis don't track any sort of regional pride, but they have a shared quality of being ugly and generally discomforting to think about. They present an almost palpable part of each country's history.

Germany [decided]( https://www.thelocal.de/20161019/how-germany-remembers-the-holocaust-world-war-two-nazis-jewish-history-germans) it was in its peoples' [best interest](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/10colwe.html) to [memorialize](https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/member-countries/holocaust-education-remembrance-and-research-germany) the failings of German society in confronting the forces leading to the Holocaust, and requires its citizens and visitors alike to confront its existence.

Would there be a public policy interest in the US to enact similar memorials to the tragedy of slavery, i.e. create public memorials and statues to the assorted depravities of American slavery? What would be the counterarguments?"

I'm looking for a sound understanding of the reasons and merit of the Libyan invasion and the downstream consequences. Sources like books and articles are especially encouraged, and while they don't need to be politically unbiased I'd prefer they be well sourced and not purely polemical."
"What are the context, precedent, and legality of America's killing of Qasem Soleimani?","On January 3, an American military drone [destroyed](https://www.ibtimes.com/iran-threatens-revenge-it-mourns-guards-killed-us-2895702) a convoy near the Baghdad airport that included five members of the local militia and five officers from the Iranian military. The most notable casualty was Major General Qasem Soleimani, who commanded the Quds Force, Iran's agency for foreign military intelligence and special operations.

1. What is the recent history of escalation in the conflict between Iran and the US leading up to this attack? And what was Soleimani's involvement in actions against the US and its allies?
1. Are there similar cases in the past of the US killing foreign military leaders, or of other countries killing US military leaders, outside of wartime? What were the circumstances and consequences?
1. What US law allows the killing of military officials belonging to a state with which the US is not formally at war? Does this violate any international treaties to which the US is a party? Likewise, can Iran legally kill American military leaders?"
Should the United States allow foreign airlines to fly domestic routes?,"Under U.S. law, foreign airlines are not allowed to fly routes within the United States.

Is it normal for House leaders to leave a vote open after the vote clock has expired in order to solicit members to change votes?,"[This article from The Hill](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/280542-dems-cry-foul-after-house-gop-votes-down-lgbt-measure) describes a recent vote which went against the goals of the US House majority party, so instead of closing the voting as normal they held the electronic voting method open until such time as they has pressured enough members to switch to their position. The article points out that this is contrary to Speaker Ryan's insistence on obeying House rules regarding the voting clock, which implies that perhaps this technique for securing votes has been used previously. Has it, or is this behavior unusual? Does the difference between keeping the electronic voting open versus requiring members to change votes publicly in ""the well"" matter within that context?"
What are the pros and cons of raising the income tax on the highest earners?,"I was doing some research for an unrelated topic and I came upon the following statistics for the [2016 federal income tax revenue](https://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2016-update/). The main figures I wanted to discuss are those showing that the rich pay an extraordinarily higher share of income tax compared to the amount of income they receive. The ratios for the various taxpaying percentiles are here:

* The top 1% pays 27.16%, or 13% more than the average taxpayer, as well as 39.48% of the total federal income tax.

* The top 5% pays 23.61%, or 9.45% more than the average taxpayer, as well as 59.97% of the federal income tax,

* The top 50% pays 15.52%, or 1.36% more than the average taxpayer, as well as *97.25%* of the federal income tax.

What are the pros and cons of raising income tax on the rich, and is there a moral dilemma with the minority of Americans paying the large majority of Income Tax?

Thanks in advance for the response."
Why is every US State government modeled after the Federal government?,"Almost all states use the [""presidential"" system of governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_U.S._state_governments), with a bicameral legislature, legislators are elected using single member districts, and a separate executive branch exists for the office of the governor. While minor variations in procedure exist within each state's constitution, the overall electoral process and structure of their government remains almost identical. [Reynolds vs Sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_v._Sims) case broadly outlined that states had to adopt some form of representation that is equal for all citizens in their legislature if they use districts.

Could states experimented with a parliamentary system of government or attempted any other form of electoral selection like proportional representation or sortition? Are there legal barriers preventing this, or is it mostly cultural/systemic?"
Who or what is responsible for the prevalence of autocracies in the Middle East?,"The Arab Spring, a widespread popular movement in the Middle East to democratize society, [has largely fizzled out](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/arab-spring-anniversary/416301/) with little to show for it: it succeeded fully only in Tunisia, and additionally spawned a short-lived Islamic government in Egypt and a civil war in Syria. 

For much of the world, however, the Arab Spring brought into focus the prevalence of autocracy in the Middle East ([see this list](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2017)) and brought forth a discussion of its causes, including potential Western culpability and responsibility. 

Some have cited Western interference for causing the issues stretching through the present day, citing [American](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup) and [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War) political interference in the region throughout the Cold War. Others have gone back further, referencing the [Sykes-Picot Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement) or even the legacy of Ottoman imperialism. Still others toss out such political theorizing entirely, [suggesting](https://intpolicydigest.org/2016/10/29/climate-change-driving-conflict-middle-east/) that persistent aridification and climate change in the region has led to conflict over scarce resources and the rise of authoritarianism to deal with the issue. Finally, the role of religious fundamentalism [cannot be ignored](http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article4131), though it is an open question whether it is a cause or a symptom of authoritarianism and conflict in the region ([some argue](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1408565?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that religious fundamentalism was the only viable response in response to authoritarian repression of more liberal movements, and that actions such as suicide bombings [are perfectly rational political tools](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the--rational--suicide-bomber?barrier=accessreg)).

What is the cause of persistent authoritarianism across the Middle East? Does the West hold any responsibility, and if so what obligations does it have towards the region? What can be done to resolve the issue?"

On what basis would this be legal?  What evidence is there that this is or is not a [bill of attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder)?  Or is that even a relevant question when targeting a foreign entity, which the overseas part of Harley Davidson could be considered?

How do the claims of the Nunes Memo and the Democratic reply memo hold up after the release of the Inspector General’s report?,"**How do the claims of the Nunes Memo and the Democratic reply memo hold up after the release of the Inspector General’s report?**

With the recent release of the Inspector General’s report the process in which FISA warrants were obtained against Carter Page, I feel that it’s worthwhile to re-examine the Nunes Memo and the Democrat’s reply memo (aka “Demo”). We have the benefit of two years of additional information, and the IG’s recent report gives both more and less information than we had before.

This has been a topic that has been addressed before here in this subreddit, so long-time readers may recall some of the past threads over the years.

Nunes made several claims in his Feb 2018 letter, and within a month it was [announced]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/inspector-general-announces-he-will-review-justice-departments-surveillance-of-former-trump-campaign-adviser/2018/03/28/23651efe-32bb-11e8-94fa-32d48460b955_story.html) that the Inspector General would be looking into the FISA warrants. 

**Questions presented**

* How do Nunes’ claims hold up now that we have more information? 
* How does the Democratic memo hold up?
* Does the IG’s report support claims made by Nunes and/or the Democrats rebuttal?


Specifically, Nunes said that “material and relevant information was omitted,” from the FISA applications. I will try my best to summarize what Nunes claims below:

1. The initial and renewal applications did not contain information that the DNC paid for Steele’s dossier as a means to obtain derogatory information on Trump’s ties to Russia, and it does not mention that Steele was authorized payment by the FBI. 
2. Furthermore, Fusion GPS’s and Perkins Coie’s roles were not disclosed despite the ties being known by the DOJ.
3. The applications cited a Yahoo News article as corroborating evidence for Steele’s work when in fact Steele leaked his information to Yahoo news. Steele should have been terminated in September but concealed his activities from the FBI.
4. Steele maintained contacts with the FBI through Bruce Ohr, and through Ohr the FBI learned that Steele was biased and that this bias did not make it into the applications or the renewals. Also, Ohr’s wife worked for Fusion GPS and both persons’ ties to Steele and Fusion GPS were concealed from the FISC.
5. Steele’s information wasn’t corroborated at the time of the initial FISA application. Deputy Director McCabe said that that without the Steele dossier, there would have not been a FISA warrant.
6. The FISA warrant mentions Papadopoulos and how it triggered a counterintelligence investigation but does not link them together in a conspiracy.
7. The Strozk/Page text messages are indications of bias.

Meanwhile, then-minority House Democrats and also made a series of claims, which I will again try my best to summarize:

1. FBI and DOJ officials did not “abuse the FISA process, omit material information, or subvert the [FISA process]"" to spy on the Trump campaign
2. The DOJ used a “multi-pronged rationale” that narrowly used Steele’s information along with independent sources
3. The FBI was transparent with the FISC about Steele’s “background, credibility, and potential bias.” The Court was also informed that Steele was terminated as a source for making unauthorized disclosures.
4. The planned DOJ payment against Steele was cancelled.
5. The DOJ appropriately included Papadopoulos in the FISA application, and excluding it would have been negligent.
6. Bruce Ohr’s role was mischaracterized by the Nunes Memo.
7. Peter Strozk and Lisa Page’s text messages are irrelevant.

Note: If I missed something in my summary, please advise and I will try to correct. It's challenging to distill down 15+ pages of accusations and counter-accusations into handful of neutrally-framed sentences, and any omission is unintentional.

Does the House of Representatives have legal standing to sue over President Trump's emergency order to build a border wall? Are there any persons/groups that certainly do have legal standing?,"[President Trump will declare a National Emergency today](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-national-emergency-border.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) over immigration at the Southern border ([The order has now been announced](https://www.apnews.com/5b22a4a54ba046c4815c31bca2c92ae7)).

The order is likely to meet outside legal challenges (From 1st source):

> A parade of liberal advocacy organizations sent out pre-written statements promising to challenge any such declaration in court as “an outrageous abuse of power” by an “unstable and increasingly autocratic” president, as one of the groups, Public Citizen, put it.

In Congress, there is potential for [a joint resolution to block the emergency order](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-congress-national-emergency.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage), however without two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate, the president could easily veto it:

> Under the National Emergencies Act, the House and the Senate can take up what is called a joint resolution of termination to end the emergency status if they believe the president is acting irresponsibly or the threat has dissipated.  

...

> To keep a president’s party from bottling such a measure up, the law says that if one chamber passes such a resolution, the other one must bring it up for a vote within 18 days. Though Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, they would need only a handful of Republicans to join them to pass the resolution there and send it to Mr. Trump’s desk. 

Aside from a joint resolution, The New York times describes the House as having two legal options: Democrats could either sue or they could join a third party lawsuit. There is a caveat in that if the House itself sues, they might not have legal 'standing' (From 3rd source):

> There are questions about the House’s legal standing if it were to try to sue on its own, and House leaders and their lawyers will have to decide if it is worth risking filing suit themselves only to be dismissed by a judge for lack of standing. 

----

I have a few questions about lawsuits involving Trump's emergency order:

1: Do Democrats have legal standing to sue over Trump's emergency declaration? Specifically, how could they gain standing?

2: Democrats might also join a third party suit. Are there any third party groups or individuals that would certainly have standing against Trump's order?

Bonus side thing: What is legal 'standing'?

"Who is making money off the Mexico–United States barrier (""the wall"")? What is it, anyway? And how much (additional) ""wall"" has been built under the current administration?","[On January 25, 2017, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 13767, which formally directed the US government to begin attempting to construct a border wall using existing federal funding, although actual construction of a wall did not begin at this time due to the large expense and lack of clarity on how it would be paid for.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_wall#Executive_Order_(2017\))

[Hard to say, really](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-has-put-up-39-miles-of-wall-on-2-000-mile-border-despite-claims-of-more):

> The *Washington Examiner* asked the Army Corps to clarify how many miles of wall it has put up over the past 23 months, but the corps said only Customs and Border Protection could provide the figure.

""Based on that updated information, it appears that **CBP has now constructed 1.7 miles of fencing with its fiscal year 2018 funding**."" 


&nbsp;

All this makes me wonder, is there any sort of process here? Specifically, 

* What companies have the contracts to construct ""the wall""? Who are they subcontracting to? [What previous work have they done that makes them qualified for this project](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/government-cancels-brexit-ferry-contract-with-no-ship-firm)?

* How much has been spent since 25 January 2017 on new wall construction?
* How much new wall has been built since 25 January 2017?"

How will this question be useful to enforce voting laws? Is there a potential for misuse of this information? Do the states in question have legal grounds to sue for the removal of this question?"
"In light of the new trade agreement between Japan and the EU, was it a mistake for the U.S. to walk away from the TPP, and how difficult will this be for the U.S. going forward?","Japan and the EU have reached what seems to be a pretty huge free trade deal.

What are the consequences of the recent Italian election and the causes of the change in electoral makeup?,"Yesterday on March 4th, the [Italian 2018 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_general_election,_2018) was held to elect the 630 members of the Chamber of Deputies and the 315 members of the Senate. 

BBC has a good graphic for the positions of the factions/parties on the main issues of the election: [Graphic](https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/E3D8/production/_100282385_italy_where_they_stand-nc.png), [Source article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43291390)

The [results](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/mar/05/italian-elections-2018-full-results-renzi-berlusconi) showed M5S taking the lead as the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies, a historic change. M5S got 32.22%, PD got 18.9%, Lega Nord got 17.69%, FI got 13.94%, meaning that the center-right group got around 31.7%. The center-right faction and center-left factions got slightly more than their totals currently because they are allied with groups of smaller parties. Overall, the results [showed](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/secondary/italian-election-2018-results-map-who-won-Italy-election-latest-1256263.jpg) ([source article](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/927272/italian-election-2018-results-map-who-won-Italy-election-latest)) the center-right faction as the largest faction with 37.00%, 5SM with 32.31%. 

This is a historic win of the anti-establishment over the establishment, and has many implications for Italy. 

• What was the cause of the shift towards the populist Five Star Movement?

• How much of an effect did party positions on immigration and the European Union have on the results?

• What statements have been made about possible coalitions by the relevant parties?

__**Background**__  
The election took place under a complex combination of FPTP, MMP and PR - First Past The Post, Mixed-Member Proportional and Proportional Representation, after being set in place by the [2016 Italian Constitutional Referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_constitutional_referendum,_2016). [This article written before the election](http://www.businessinsider.fr/uk/italy-election-2018-what-you-need-to-know-2018-2) goes over the electoral system, the emergence of the Five Star Movement and predictions.


Main coalitions:

The center-left coalition is primarily made up of the Democratic Party (PD), but also includes More Europe (+E), Together (I), Popular Civic List (CP), SVP-PATT, and Aosta Valley (VdA)

The center-right coalition is primarily made up of League/Lega Nord (L), Forza Italia (FI), but also includes the Brothers of Italy (FdI), and Us with Italy (NcI). 

The main parties in the election were:  

• [Democratic Party (PD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_\(Italy\)): A center-left party devoted to social democracy and social liberalism. The party is a result of the merger of numerous center-left parties, and has been in power since 2013.   

• [League (L)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord): League, or Lega Nord, is a regional right-wing political party advocating populism, federalism and is a strong opponent of globalization, immigration and a soft Euroskeptic party.   

• [Forza Italia (FI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Italia_\(2013\)): Forza Italia, or Forward Italy, is a center-right coalition based upon Christian democracy and liberal conservatism.   

• [Five Star Movement (5SM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Star_Movement): Five Star Movement is an anti-establishment party coalition with various principles and many factions: environmentalism, anti-globalization, Euroskepticism, populism, direct democracy are some of its core ideals. There has been ambiguity around the party's position on immigration, Grillo (the party's founder) [advocating](http://www.ansa.it/english/news/politics/2016/12/23/grillo-calls-for-mass-deportations-2_c2583737-0f97-4157-a2f3-d2a9137728b6.html) for the expulsion of all illegal immigrants from Italy, but there is no official position. 

The polling had shown a decline in the center-left coalition share of the vote and an increase of the 5SM share of the vote, with the center-right share of the vote remaining fairly static. [An image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OpinionPollingItalyGeneralElection2018.png). [The source article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Italian_general_election,_2018)"
Has there actually been a statistically meaningful increase in hate-crimes since Trump was elected?,"The media seems to be implying that hate-crimes are on the rise^1, but as of yet I haven't heard any of the major outlets flat-out say ""Hate crimes have risen compared to this time last year..."", or similar.

Take for example, [this article^1](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hate-harassment-incidents-spike-since-donald-trump-election/) from CBS, which claims ""According to new numbers from the FBI, hate crimes were up almost 7 percent in 2015. That includes a 67 percent jump in crimes against Muslims.""

However, they cited increases in 2015.

[This statement](http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/rise-in-hate-crimes-following-donald-trump-election-win/) from the Southern Poverty Law Center does not specifically say the percentage of hate-crimes has risen; it simply claims there have been 700 since Trump was elected.

So, does anyone know for sure if there has been a statistically meaningful increase in hate-crimes since Trump was elected?"
"What is the constitutionality of so-called ""Red Flag"" laws in the United States?","After the [mass shootings in Texas and Ohio](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/mass-shootings-el-paso-texas-dayton-ohio), the debate on gun control policy has once again resurfaced in the public purview. 

In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine [has pushed for the passage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/ohio-texas-red-flag-gun-policy.html) of a so-called ""Red Flag"" law. These are ""[state laws that authorize courts to issue a special type of protection order, allowing the police to temporarily confiscate firearms from people who are deemed by a judge to be a danger to themselves or to others.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/us/red-flag-laws.html)"" An example of a state with a current Red Flag law is [Oregon](https://www.doj.state.or.us/crime-victims/victims-resources/other-resources/oregons-red-flag-law/): 

>Oregon’s Red Flag law requires a fairly simple process. The first step is for a concerned family member, household member, or law enforcement officer to ask the court for an Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO), which will remove a weapon, or a concealed handgun license, from an individual who is at risk for suicide or is a danger to others. An Order also prevents the person from buying additional guns for a one year period. The law is nicknamed “Red Flag Law” for when a person exhibits a ‘red flag’ or other indicator that they may be a harm to themselves, or others. It is one of the few tools that family and household members have to quickly remove a weapon from somebody who is at risk. 

Other states include [Florida](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-red-flag-law-passed-after-parkland-has-saved-lives-advocates-say/) and [Maryland](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-red-flag-update-20190115-story.html). However, there has been [some](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/08/red-flag-laws-are-the-wrong-solution-to-mass-shootings/) [issues](https://mises.org/power-market/red-flag-laws-latest-anti-gun-scheme) raised regarding these laws. 

How do these laws interact with the Constitutional right to bear arms and to avail of due process?

> A prediction: Donald Trump will make novel and unusual use of the President's pardon power. An under-utilized tool of political power.

Can the president pardon anyone for any reason? Can it be done multiple times for the same person, or different people relating to the same issue? Does someone have to be convicted for the pardon, or can it follow simply after formal charges are made?

Were they simply not in chambers today or is there more of a strategic reason to not vote on this bill? As someone greatly interested in the Democratic primary while also being interested in the inner workings of Congress, it seems odd that so many higher profile Democrats, like Warren, Sanders, and Harris, for example, would sit out this vote.

What are the pros and cons of police not having a duty to protect citizens?,"In 2005, [Warren vs District of Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia) was upheld in [Town of Castle Rock v Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Castle_Rock_v._Gonzales), reaffirming that police in the US have no duty to protect citizens. The outcome upholding that their sole duty is to enforce the law on behalf of the State.

What are the pros and cons of the police lacking the legal obligation to protect citizens? How does it compare with the Duty to Rescue doctrine in other countries? Is it is line with our Constitutional Principles? Does the calculus change in jurisdictions where the head of the police are elected rather than appointed? Does a lack of dual responsibility to the State and to its Citizens result in State power centralization?

Are there any documented instances of forest mismanagement in the areas affected by California's ongoing wildfires?,"[Context](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-wildfires/death-toll-rises-to-23-in-california-wildfire-after-14-bodies-found-idUSKCN1NE0WQ):

There are two large ongoing wildfires in California. The Camp Fire has covered more than [156 square miles](https://abc7news.com/maps-a-look-at-the-camp-fire-in-butte-county-and-other-california-fires/4656293/) (404 km^2 ) between Chico and the Plumas National Forest in Northern California and remains only 20% contained. Meanwhile, the Woolsey Fire covers 109 square miles (282 km^2 ) in the area around Thousand Oaks and Malibu west of Los Angeles and is 0% contained.

President Trump has stated that the fires are due to [forest mismanagement](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/trump-mismanagement-forests-blame-california-fires-181110085539030.html) on California's part, and has threatened to cut off federal funding if that is not remedied.

However, a spokesperson for CA Governor Jerry Brown and the president of California Professional Firefighters have both stated that nearly [60% of California's forests are under federal control](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/10/trump-blames-gross-mismanagement-wildfires-leave-trail-death-destruction-california/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.70481f8af284), including a majority of the areas affected by the fires, and that the state has increased its funding for forest services while the federal government has cut back funding for it.

Experts have blamed the unusually intense fires on excessive build-up of flammable material due to [decades of fire suppression](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Trump-on-California-s-Camp-Fire-Forest-13380388.php) as well as ""rising temperatures and longer spells of dry weather.""

1. Could the conditions allowing for these fires been prevented by better forest management?
1.  Are there any documented instances of waste, fraud, or abuse within forest services at either the CA state or federal level?
1. Could any forest services in the areas affected by the fire be characterized as negligent, inefficient, underfunded, or otherwise poorly executed? If, so by whom?
1. What is the legality of refusing federal payments to states as a punishment for poor state-run environmental services? Is there precedent for it?

The current government parties, however, have <1% of City Councils in Catalonia (1/794). Are there any international precedents of such situation? Are such scenarios sustainable?","The main point of the question/s is to discuss the relationship that local councils and local governments has with the bigger picture nowadays in any modern democracy:

- How much power do local governments represent, if any, and should that be taken into account in current politics or it doesn't hold any real significance.

- Is it sustainable when there's such unbalance between one territory and another —like it's happening now in Catalonia— and what kind of measures should be used to solve this, taking into account that these kind of conflicts have historically escalated into violence and wars, making that an unacceptable way —and one that the catalans aren't going to push.

Actual question/s are at the bottom, after all the context is given.

Sources for claims in title (basically electoral data), plus involved parties political alignment:

1. [AMI](http://www.municipisindependencia.cat/), Association of Municipalities for Independence (link is official webpage), has, according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Municipalities_for_Independence), *""the support of 786 town councils out of the 948 total in Catalonia (82,9%). In addition, 39 out of 42 county councils give support to the association and also all the four Catalan provincial councils.""*

2. The lasting ~20% of City Councils are owned by PSC and CSQEP, which are center-left and hard-left leaning parties that are part of state-wide parties ([PSOE-PSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialists%27_Party_of_Catalonia)) and coalitions (CSQEP and [Podemos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos_\(Spanish_political_party\))). Those parties are the actual opposition in [the Spanish Congress](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Spanish_Congress_of_Deputies_\(12th_Legislature\).svg). PSOE (the main spanish opposition party right now —homologous of Democrats in the US, and Labour in the UK) rejected 155 application during all the legislature, but has backed it once the PP-Ciudadanos Government pushed for it earlier this week; Podemos, the 3th party in seats, rejects it all the way.

3. Between the aforementioned City Councils ruled by PSC or CSQEP, are most of the biggest cities in Catalonia, like Barcelona and the cosmopolitan surroundings, Tarragona, or Lleida, making 3 of 4 the province Capitals. This shows an interesting part of the whole point, imo: the political weight that life in big cities —""modern, cosmopolitan life""— has in these kind of matters that affect the rest of a territory, with lower density.

4. Albeit those ~20% of City Councils aren't part of the Association of Municipalities for Independence, many of them have already [openly rejected](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20171021/432245123748/alcaldes-psc-piden-rechazar-155.html) the application of 155 —including the Barcelona one, which mayor is part of CSQEP, the coalition party that rejects it in the Spanish Congress. This doesn't mean they will not abide, but it shows their disconformity.

5. The actual [government in Spain](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/XII_legislatura_de_Espa%C3%B1a), elected in 2016 and that pushed for the 155 application this past week, is mainly PP with the support Ciudadanos. Between those 2 parties, they rule one single tiny town in Catalonia (sourced in next point).

5. The only City Council owned by Spain's ruling party (PP) in Catalonia is [Pontons](http://www.huffingtonpost.es/2017/07/18/la-vida-en-pontons-el-unico-municipio-catalan-donde-gobierna-el_a_23035629/), a 453 citizens municipality, making it an anecdote —still, as a curiosity, that town had a [80% turnout](http://elmon.cat/politica/arrasa-lunic-municipi-governat-pel-pp) in the 1-O 'illegal' referendum.

7. Among the previous point, Ciudadanos, the party that supports PP in Madrid and earns them the Government, hasn't got a single municipality currently —and has only had one single mayor there, in it's brief history.

8.

Further context:

**What is the 155 article of the Spanish Constitution, and why has it been pushed?**

- The 155 article of the Spanish Constitution [was pushed by Spain's Government](https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/10/21/inenglish/1508587023_487115.html) this past weekend, and will have to go through the Senate to be approved. Such article is [a measure](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art%C3%ADculo_155_de_la_Constituci%C3%B3n_espa%C3%B1ola_de_1978) to shield the State from disobedience in any autonomous community, when any autonomous government (in this case, the catalan Generalitat of Catalonia) rejects following the requests of the Central Government, which would be backed by the Constitutional law that rules us all.

- The reason for Madrid's central government applying the 155 is the Catalan Government push for an Unillateral Declaration of Independence. The reason the Catalan Government has been able to push for that it's because it has [an absolute majority in seats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), as of the last elections in pro-Yes parties. After the 'illegal referendum' as the finishing point of the legislature —complying with the main point of their electoral promises— the Independence of Catalonia was [announced yet immediatelly suspended](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/catalan-government-suspends-declaration-of-independence), after the 1st of October vote. The immediate suspension was to call for a dialogue in terms, for negotiating a better way out —a legal one— than the unillateral, after the Catalan Government considered the [1st of October 'illegal' referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_independence_referendum,_2017) success substantial enough to push for independence. That kind of measure has been compared with the [Slovenian way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brioni_Agreement) of gaining independence in 1991.

- This suspenden situation lasted about a month, and the Central Government finally pushed for the 155 to prevent anything else from happening. This will take away any political power from the Catalan Government, rendering the Catalan President unable to push for anything, overtaking any offices they consider necessary for the time being, plus the control of catalan autonomous police, and the public media apparently, too. In other words, the 155 is an 'à la carte' article to make the territories follow the Constitutional law.

- Pushing that article will mean that PP, a party with [8.49% of the votes in Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_regional_election,_2015#Results), will rule that territory for a while —only with the backing of Ciudadanos though, a party that has 17.90% of the vote in Catalonia, summing to 26,4% of the votes of the territory with PP. This engorges 1/4th of the people entitlement, while it creates greater distress over the 48% of pro-Yes voters, being the distress present but lesser in the lasting ~25% (pro-legal-referendum parties).

- Albeit the main goal of the PP is, allegedly, to call for new elections in the Catalan Parliament as soon as possible, [polls show](http://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20171022/encuesta-elecciones-cataluna-6371299) that the independentist simple majority is consolidated, showing a quasi-identic scenario. As such, pushing for them isn't solving anything apparently, making the situation stuck and unsustainable long term.

Last but not least, for context on independentism in the contemporary world, mainly Europe:

- [Unillateral declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilateral_declaration_of_independence), being Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo, the last ones in Europe the last half of a Century, after wars and violent episodes.

- ~~Non-unilateral~~ [declarations of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence), in modern Europe, include mainly the countries that were former parts of the USSR, like the Baltic Countries and many Balkanian ones.

**edit**: removed ""non-unilateral"", as that was an error of mine adding it for emphasis, and /u/CQME kindly addressed that this was not right.

---

So, for the question/s, I guess they are:

- **Are there any other modern territories where virtually none of the local councils are represented by the main party, or any coalition, that rules the upper instances of the territory, outside of it?**

- **Are such scenarios sustainable only by the rule of law, which is the only thing the Spanish main parties have said they'll follow, ever?**

I'm quite illiterate in terms of history and politics, but the closest situations I know of are:

- The Northern Ireland situation, where they're mainly overruled by the UK in many things (part of the peace treaties), albeit Wikipedia shows me that [there're a big deal of local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Northern_Ireland) ruled by unionist parties in Northern Ireland —as far as I can tell, unionist conservative parties like DUP are part of the Conservatives main party, in the House of Commons, and Labour does too, so there's indeed some balance there.

- In Spain, the other really distinct autonomous community, the Basque Country, has too [3 out of 251](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Popular_del_Pa%C3%ADs_Vasco#Elecciones_municipales_y_forales_2015) city councils. However, as center to right Basque Nationalists aren't currently pushing for independence, they actually have some deals with Spain's hard unionist parties like PP and Ciudadanos. (In Spain, which screams conflict, the main voted party is the 4th and 5th party in Catalonia and Basque Country, gathering ).

- It's worth mentiong that the above 2 territories had a violent apporach by radical groups back in the day, being [ETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_\(separatist_group\)) a terrorist group for Basque independentists, and the [IRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army), a paramilitary army."
San Francisco proposed initiative to retroactively tax IPO income on individuals. Is this constitutional?,"https://www.axios.com/san-francisco-proposes-ipo-tax-uber-lyft-63d1d608-0819-44ab-860b-066371b08038.html

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-24/san-francisco-ipo-tax-would-target-uber-and-other-tech-startups

San Francisco is proposing a **retroactive** tax on IPO-based personal income. Would such a tax be constitutional per the ex-post-facto provision of the Constitution?

Ex-post-facto laws are explicitly forbidden in [Article I Sec 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_10:_Limits_on_the_States):

> No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, **ex post facto Law**, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility"
There is a proposal to force visitors to the US to divulge their social media passwords. Is it legal and how could it be enforced?,"This article suggests that this proposal, based on an earlier policy considered by the Obama administration, is back on the table again:

Original Memorandum Text (2015): https://www.scribd.com/document/293529513/Policy-Memorandum-Social-Networking-Site-Redacted

Edit: full transcript of Kelly's remarks:
http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=514175464

> KELLY: Yeah. You know, pick a country. The thing that we're looking for is when a person comes in, the State Department does these interviews. Someone comes in and says, I want to come to the United States. Then we ask them to give us a list of websites that they visit and the passwords to get on those websites to see what they're looking at. This is...

> MARTIN: You require that of anyone who is looking to immigrate to the U.S.?

> KELLY: Well, considering that, yeah - social media to see what they tweet; cell phones - cell phone conversations or cell phone contact books to where we can run them against databases, telephone numbers, people's names. Europe, the United States maintains databases and shares those databases. So these are some of the things we're thinking about.

My initial concern would be over whether this type of invasive screening would be legal, but I think more important would be the question of its implementation.

1) Do the existing provisions (4th amendment) apply here (EFF seem to think it does based on Riley v California: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/fear-materialized-border-agents-demand-social-media-data-americans) or since the proposed policy changes are specific to visitors does the 4th not apply?


2) How can such a policy be enforced with travellers who don't divulge their participation in social media?"
Can the President Order Firms to Leave China?,"US President Donald Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164914959131848705) on Friday that he is ordering US firms to find an alternative to China and bring their business home to America.

Over the weekend, Trump [asserted](https://www.apnews.com/be18b8619cde4658a418dda4f416968a) that he holds such broad power thanks to the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act), a piece of legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter.

My questions:

1. What precedent, if any, supports Trump's position that POTUS can use a national emergency declaration to regulate and compel international trade? Or are there any precedents against the view?
2. What is the legal process by which an administration executes that law's provisions?
3. In light of the fact that China contributes billions to the earnings of US corporations like Apple, how could US firms challenge Trump's supposed legal authority if he does execute the order?
4. What can Congress and the courts do to stop Trump from attempting the sweeping order on trade?"
"How can undocumented immigrants be subject to criminal proceedings for crossing the border, which is a civil offense?","In several articles such as this one: [http://thehill.com/latino/394782-protests-against-trump-immigration-policy-expected-nationwide](http://thehill.com/latino/394782-protests-against-trump-immigration-policy-expected-nationwide)

There are several references to ""criminal prosecution"" for border crossing.  But illegal entry (or improper entry) into an US border carries a civil  penalty. The amount is at least $50 and not more than $250 or twice that  amount, if the person has been previously fined with a civil penalty  for the same violation. (See 8 U.S.C. Section 1325, I.N.A. Section 275.) "
"Are work requirements for welfare effective, and how should we measure welfare success?","[Last year the Trump administration moved to restore work requirements for welfare recipients](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/30/trump-moves-restore-work-requirement-welfare/), bringing law back in line with the 1996 welfare reforms. 

This begs the question, are welfare work requirements effective? 

Two states seem to have done studies. [Maine produced this report](http://www.maine.gov/economist/docs/TANF%20Report%20Final%205-25-17.pdf) after instituting work requirements for food stamp recipients who were fit for work and found significant growth in incomes and decreases in joblessness. [The state of Kansas produced this report](https://thefga.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PowerOfWork-KansasWelfareReform.pdf) which produced similar findings after instituting work requirements. 

However, [The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities produced this report](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/work-requirements-dont-cut-poverty-evidence-shows) which found that, while joblessness decreases initially, the effects may not persist. 

I think another fair question to be asked in this discussion is, how should we measure the effectiveness of our welfare programs? Is it the number of people which we are able to enroll, or is it better measured by the enrolee's likelihood of finding a job which more than accounts for the welfare they were receiving?"
Is the PREPA/Whitefish Energy contract unusual for a government contract after a natural disaster?,"There has been [substantial controversy](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/10/24/559864118/tiny-montana-firm-gets-300-million-contract-to-help-restore-power-in-puerto-rico) about the awarding of a $300 million contract by PREPA, the [Puerto Rican power authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority) to a company called Whitefish Energy, which apparently had only two employees and $1 million in annual revenue prior to the contract.

Yesterday a purported copy of the PREPA/Whitefish contract was posted online.  

**Edit: Apparently the copy of the contract may contain personal information of some of the signatories.  I've pulled the link though the relevant excerpt can be found [here](https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/923741769719779328)**

Is this contract unusual in form?  Are there provisions which are atypical or prohibited in government contracts.  In particular I wonder about Article 59 of the contract, which states:

>The Contractor agrees to provide PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the Contractor which are directly pertinent to this Contract for the purposes of making audits, examination, excerpts, and transctipstions, during the Contractor's performance of the contract and for up to three (3) years after Contractor's receipt of final payment under the Contract. **In no event shall PREPA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the FEMA administrator, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements of the labor rates specified herein.**

(Emphasis added)

Is there precedent for a contractor like Whitefish getting a contract like this?  If so, is it a good precedent or bad precedent?

Is the contract typical in form and content for these sort of contracts?  If not, how serious are the deviations?  Is the 'no audit' provision in respect to labor rates normal?"
What is the point of the US debt ceiling?,"The US debt ceiling is in the news again, and a failure to extend the debt ceiling could result in the [US government defaulting on its debt](http://dailycaller.com/2017/07/12/the-federal-gov-is-facing-this-serious-fiscal-crisis/), which could have huge consequences for the global economy.

My reading of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_debt_ceiling) is that the debt ceiling seems like an artifact resulting from the fact that Congress used to authorize every single debt individually; as the US economy and debt grew, this was just shifted to an aggregate authorization:

>Under Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution, only Congress can authorize the borrowing of money on the credit of the United States. From the founding of the United States until 1917, Congress directly authorized each individual debt issued. To provide more flexibility to finance the United States' involvement in World War I, Congress modified the method by which it authorized debt in the Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.[3] Under this Act, Congress established an aggregate limit, or ""ceiling,"" on the total amount of new bonds that could be issued.

What substantive change would a non-existent (i.e., infinitely large) debt ceiling be from the status quo? Is the debt ceiling the best way for Congress to handle its authority for borrowing money? If not, what would be better ways?"
Does President Trump's international business empire cause conflict with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution?,"-----

**Introduction:**

-----

I am a lawyer with an interest in Constitutional Law, but I practice Family Law and therefore may not have the absolute best grasp of the interpretation of Constitutional Law.

Moreover, the Emoluments Clause is somewhat obscure, not often covered or taught in law school, and not often discussed in my area of law other than theoretically.

I am posting to foster discussion on this topic, learn, and better understand how President Trump's business empire interacts with the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution.

The information I have gathered purporting a violation of the Emoluments Clause is best summed up in [this](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gs_121616_emoluments-clause1.pdf) paper.

**Summary:**

-----

I implore you to read both papers in their entirety, but for brevity sake as a brief introduction, or as a refresher after you've read them - here is my understanding of the argument that these papers make.

-----

[Article I, Section 9](http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/68/emoluments-clause) of the Constitution provides as follows: “No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And **no Person holding any Office** of Profit or Trust under them, **shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.”**

-----

Violation?

-----

The Eisen paper argues for a broad interpretation of the clause, stating **""...the Clause unquestionably reaches any situation in which a federal officeholder receives money, items of value, or services from a foreign state.**

The Eisen paper concludes that **While holding office, Mr. Trump will receive—by virtue of his continued interest in the Trump Organization and his stake in hundreds of other entities—a steady stream of monetary and other benefits from foreign powers and their agents.** Applied to Mr. Trump’s diverse dealings, **the text and purpose of the Emoluments Clause speak as one: this cannot be allowed.**  

-----

No Violation?

-----

The Grewal paper argues for a narrower interpretation, stating that **""...Only transactions conducted at other than arm’s length, or transactions involving the provision of services by the President personally, establish potential violations.""**

Under an office-related definition, the sale of goods generally would not give to emoluments, such as where she sold property at an arm’s length price to a foreign government. Under this reading, only goods sold at other than fair market value would trigger an Emoluments analysis.

**Discussion Outline:**

-----

I'd like to refrain from discussing the penalties for violating the Emoluments Clause, how important you think the Emoluments Clause is in relation to other issues, or whether or not you think violating the Emoluments Clause matters.

The main points I'd like to discuss have to do with the text and interpretation of the Emoluments Clause as applied to President Trump's international business presence and whether or not it has been or is being violated.

Another interesting point of discussion is how most Presidents have used a ""blind trust"" to circumvent problems regarding the Emoluments Clause - in which you place pre-Presidential personal holdings in a trust and give complete control to an independent third party - and how President Trump's discussion of ""[giving control to his son](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/11/news/trump-business-conflicts-plan/)"" may or may not cure the defect or satisfy the blind trust requirements of an independent third party.

Last, I would like to discuss which interpretation of the Emoluments Clause is better to achieve the goal of anti-corruption from foreign powers, and which of the enumerated specific instances you believe either do or no not violate one or both interpretations of the Emoluments Clause. "
"New York Mayor Bill DeBlasio has called for a national draft of civilian doctors to help the areas hardest hit by COVID-19, like New York City. Is there any legal basis for such an idea?","The [New York Times reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html) :

The  Selective Service system is the existing mechanism for a military draft in the United States. It [currently specifies a random lottery of men between the ages of 20-25](https://www.sss.gov/about/return-to-draft/lottery/).  Is there a legal basis for the President to unilaterally modify these criteria to call on people in specific professions and ignore the gender and age requirements? If not, does the Constitution allow Congress to pass a new draft law that would? Is there any other legal mechanism available to the President outside of military use of the Selective Service that would enable these actions?

What are the Implications of the Queen's Suspension of Parliament?,"As someone from the US, I'm curious to learn more about what it means to have the Queen suspend Parliament (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49493632). Some more specific questions include:

Who will be in charge of the government and its decisions while Parliament is suspended? Are these powers given to an individual, to a committee, or anything more broad?

How long does the suspension of Parliament last?

Has this ever happened before to set a precedent that we could expect to be followed?

How could this most likely affect the outcome of Brexit with regards to creating a deal or having a no-deal Brexit? (I imagine this is closely related to the first question of who will be in charge now)

What strategies for mitigating planned obsolescence would be viable for the United States?,"[Planned obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence) is the design of a product  with an intentional artificially shortened life time. The goal of this is to reduce the time between repeat purchases of a product from the same manufacturer. One example of such a product would be smartphones, with emphasis on iPhones. 

With the recent Supreme Court case, [Impression v. Landmark](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/impression-products-inc-v-lexmark-international-inc/), could be seen as a step towards mitigating planned obsolescence. A Right to Repair could be seen as a [precedent for similar cases](https://www.wired.com/2017/06/impression-v-lexmark/), such as the one involving farmers repairing or modifying their tractors.


[France has recently passed a law aimed to mitigate planned obsolescence strategies by manufacturers.](https://www.fastcompany.com/3043252/this-new-french-law-is-designed-to-make-products-easier-to-repair-so-th) This law requires manufacturers to label their products with how long spare parts for that product will be available, and they must repair or replace the product if it breaks within the first two years of purchase.


What other strategies have been proposed to reduce planned obsolescence?"

Unaccompanied immigrant minors having to represent themselves in immigration court.,"Unaccompanied immigrant minors have to represent themselves in immigration court throughout the deportation proceedings, and it seems to have been happening for a while [Source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/06/27/immigrant-children-deportation-court/739205002/).

What evidence exists around the idea that high-income earners are likely to move to avoid higher taxes?,"One of the biggest news stories in the UK currently is the leak/release of Labour's manifesto for the 2017 general election, which you can find through here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39877439

Many of these proposals - such as re-nationalising the railways, spending £8bn pounds on social care, building 100,000 new homes - will be expensive. Labour say they will be able to pay for its policies by increasing taxes on the rich, for example 'increasing income tax for the highest-earning 5% to raise an extra £6bn for the NHS'.

While Labour have rejected this, this current manifesto has been compared to their previous pledges in the 1970s and 80s, especially the 1983 manifesto: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39872189. Those policies remain controversial today - the high income tax-rates of 1970s Britain under Labour (83% on the richest earners) even caused Rod Stewart to move to L.A. and name an album about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Crossing

Granted, this is just one case of a very rich guy packing up because he's being taxed quite highly. But there are numerous studies that support both sides of the argument: that rich people do leave - in significant enough numbers - when a high tax-rate is introduced, or that rich people don't leave - in significant enough numbers - when one is introduced (have put links at the bottom).

So...

- Which side is generally supported by economists?
- If it exists, has the frequency of 'rich migration' varied over time?
- And do the benefits of higher taxes outweigh the impact of those high earners leaving?

*Note: if it helps for the argument, this can be related to taxes over than income-tax. Capital gains, property, inheritance etc., but income-tax is the main one I'm focused on atleast. Also, this is mainly concerned with the West/US and UK, but with the nature of globalisation today I can understand how practically all countries' tax-rates may link into it.*

"What are the pros and cons of governments embracing remote work, generally?","Key Questions:

* What are the known effects after a government adopts policies to encourage working from home?
* What policies would need to change to adapt?
* What policies and other changes (e.g., city design, broadband access, general infrastructure) would need to occur if this is the future of work
* Is there any evidence that this is the long-term future of work?
* What is the likely impact - short, medium, long - of more remote work?

Many companies, particularly large technology companies, are [encouraging remote work for roles where this is feasible](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-asking-employees-to-work-from-home-due-to-coronavirus-2020). There are [issues](https://www.epi.org/blog/amid-covid-19-outbreak-the-workers-who-need-paid-sick-days-the-most-have-the-least/) with traditional wage earners in service roles that require coming into work, but in general, if you can work from home, companies are encouraging you to work from home.

This is likely to last at least a month if not longer. If this is the big experiment it seems to be, what metrics can we use to determine whether it's successful, and overall, what are the pros and cons of remote work?

What evidence is there that this provides a social benefit (or not)? Is it just a nice option for more flexibility?

Is there any evidence that it encourages broadband access in remote areas, or that it facilitates less clustering around certain metropolitan areas? How do we deal with employees that cannot work from home?"
How does Bernie Sanders' jobs guarantee proposal compare to other countries' active labor market policies?,"Recently, US Senator and [former Presidential candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders_presidential_campaign,_2016) Bernie Sanders proposed a policy whereby the [US Government would guarantee a job paying $15/hr plus health insurance to anyone who wanted one.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/04/23/bernie-sanders-to-unveil-plan-to-guarantee-every-american-a-job/?utm_term=.12a6074c522d)  Per the proposal: ""Under the job guarantee, every American would be entitled to a job under one of these projects or receive job training to be able to do so, according to an early draft of the proposal.""

What legal/policy/legislative strategies can be used to push back against gerrymandering?,"[Gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering) is a practice intended to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by manipulating district boundaries.

[Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/supreme-court-gerrymandering-census.html). This last week, SCOTUS ruled on a two major gerrymandering cases, one favoring democrats and another favoring republicans.

In both cases before the court, NC and MD, one party felt that a state's districts were unfairly drawn to give one political party a significant advantage.  Whether you agree with SCOTUS or not, they do not intend to accept any kind of standard for when a district is ""too gerrymandered"" and have left it to states to decide how to redraw their districts.

Gerrymandering occurs in the leadup to congressional redistricting, which means that a gerrymandered district can persist for many election cycles. This also make it a long, slow process that is very difficult to unwind.  What can be done now and in the future to make our elections more representative? 

While it is possible that many (mostly blue) states may pass laws that call for independent districting commissions, what can be done about states that have no intention of doing anything but making this problem worse?"
"What is the accurate, unbiased history of the escalation of norms violation in the US Senate over judicial nominees?","There is a sense from both Democrats and Republicans that the other side “started it” when it comes to the escalation of partisan warfare over the norms in the Senate in the appointment and confirmation of federal judges.

For example, [these](https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article214394299.html) [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mitch-mcconnell-is-winning-the-long-game/2018/05/30/99b81818-6371-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html) blame Democrats for filibustering multiple Bush appellate and circuit court nominees beginning in 2001, attempting to pack the courts several years later under Obama, removing the filibuster when Republicans attempted to prevent that court packing, and finally attempting a filibuster of Gorsuch in 2017. Some date Democrats’ first escalation to the blocking of Robert Bork in 1987.

Democrats, on the other hand, [argue](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/mcconnell-stole-obamas-court-seats-and-gave-them-to-trump.html) that Obama wasn’t “packing” the circuit court in the sense of expanding its size so that it could be filled only with liberal justices, but rather simply attempted to fill vacancies with nominees whose qualifications Republicans never denied, and that with those circuit court nominees, as well as Merrick Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court, Republicans took the unprecedented step of refusing on principle to allow *any* appointments, independent of any suggestion that they’re too extreme, as opposed to Democrats’ attempts merely to block the most extreme appointees.

What is the truth here? What is the complete timeline of escalations, along with the context necessary to evaluate that timeline fairly?"

Citizens assemblies are randomly sampled groups of citizens that deliberate on issues and are thought of as an alternative to representative democracy. What does the research say about their efficacy?,"[Citizen assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) are deliberative bodies formed using [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition) or random selection. The typical assembly focuses on a single topic where:

1. There is a ""Learning Phase"" where academics educate the assembly on the topic at hand.
2. There is an ""Open Forum Phase"" where members of the public, interest groups, and politicians submit comments on the topic at hand.
3. There is a ""Discussion Phase"" where the assembly deliberates with each other over the merits and demerits of proposals
4. There is a ""Decision Phase"" where members vote in favor or against the proposals. 

There has been a lot written about citizens assemblies over the years. 


* They were used to [recommend Single Transferable Voting for British columbia](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0032329206297147). The recommendation was however ignored in the referendum.

* A number of [political scientists have had plenty to write about citizen assemblies](https://cdd.stanford.edu/2019/symposium-james-s-fishkin-democracy-when-the-people-are-thinking/). 

* Citizens assemblies have been used in Ireland to build support in [legalizing gay marriage and legalizing abortion](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/16/citizens-assembly-ireland-abortion-referendum). Irish citizen assemblies have also recommended[ carbon taxes on petrochemicals and livestock and dairy production](https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/how-the-state-can-make-ireland-a-leader-in-tackling-climate-change/recommendations/).

What caused the explosion in healthcare costs in America in the early 1980's?,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/upshot/reagan-deregulation-and-americas-exceptional-rise-in-health-care-costs.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/upshot/reagan-deregulation-and-americas-exceptional-rise-in-health-care-costs.html)

For years, I've been trying to research what made healthcare costs skyrocket in the early 1980's. None of the explanations I ever got were sufficient, because they never seemed to even hint at that it largely started in the early 1980's. The only reason I'm even citing this article, is because I can't find any other article or blog that even addresses changes made to our healthcare system in the early 1980's.

The article states that the government switching from paying full price for public health expenses to a fixed amount per visit caused insurance companies to start acting more like businesses. This is allegedly what caused healthcare costs to skyrocket in America. The article says that an overall push toward deregulation and HMO's also played a role. I still don't know what to think of this, because of a lack of resources on my part.

Is the author of this article on to something, or is there more to it? Could anything else have played a role in skyrocketing healthcare costs?"
How does a 50-50 tie work in the Virginia House of Delegates?,"So last night's elections in Virginia produced a [surprising Democratic wave](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/republicans-seek-new-path-after-failure-of-gillespies-trumpism-without-trump/2017/11/07/3afb9144-c3e7-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_fallout-1125pm-1%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.b496f767538f) in the Virginia House of Delegates, where [as of this writing,](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/virginia-general-elections) at least 14 seats have changed from Republican to Democratic hands.  Currently 5 seats are still being reported as too close to call.  Of those, two Democrats hold a lead and three Republicans hold a lead.

If that shakes out with the current leads holding, and no other seats changing in a recount, that would result in an exact 50-50 tie in the House of Delegates.  (There are 100 seats)

Since the body has an even number of members, are there any tiebreaker mechanisms?  It seems like the vote on the speakership will be important, and under the [current House of Delegates rules](https://publications.virginiageneralassembly.gov/download_publication/87) I can't seem to find any indication of how it would be handled when there's an exact tie."
"Question about ""globalism"" vs Right Wing populism","I've been a little bit confused by the sort of new growing philosophy of the right the past year with things like Brexit, the alt right and Trump- and I'm not trying to pass this off in a judging way.

From what I take it these movements are based on nations regaining a sort of national identity against sort of expansive free trade deals/global alliances like NAFTA or the EU, and this expands into a skepticism of multiculturalism and allowing possibly anti-western cultures like radical Islam from seeping in to Europe or America (I.e refugee crisis).

Now I understand this at a basic level but I guess I don't really get how much of this is conspiratorial vs just a philosophy? What exactly is the main fear of so called globalism?

I've seen a lot of people suggest ""globalists"" like Hilary Clinton and George Soros are trying to push things like open borders to push toward a one world government and supression of traditional cultural identities, is there actually documented proof that's the deliberate motive behind something like NAFTA or Merkel allowing a million refugees into Germany? (This seems more conspiratorial...http://mobile.wnd.com/2016/12/globalism-and-islam-an-unholy-alliance/)

Or is it a more pragmatic concern, that people want a more isolationist approach because they are genuinely worried about the economic downsides of the TPP or whatever? Was there studies showing Britain leaving the EU was a good decision?

I just find it interesting because it's new political paradigm for me, I'm used to the 2000s when I thought of punk rock Anarcho communists being sort of the lead truther/anti government people, and now it seems it's shifted to sort of the right being ""anti elitist"""
What are the implications of the US backing out of UNESCO?,"So[ by the end of 2018 the US will supposedly be withdrawn from UNESCO.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/10/12/u-s-withdraws-from-unesco-the-u-n-s-cultural-organization-citing-anti-israel-bias/?utm_term=.f49f89dda4cf)

I did some research [\(skimming the wiki\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO#Activities) into the organization and what they do, they seem like a generally benevolent force for advancing society and science with international cooperation in the hopes of contributing to peaceable relations. I can't find anything credible supporting the 
anti-Isreael bias cited in the first link aside from the admittance of Palestine in 2011 cited below.

In the wiki I found this:
> In 2011, Palestine became a UNESCO member following a vote in which 107 member states supported and 14 opposed.[39][40] Laws passed in the United States in 1990 and 1994 mean that it cannot contribute financially to any UN organisation that accepts Palestine as a full member.[41] As a result, it withdrew its funding which accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget.[42] Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israel payments to the UNESCO and imposing sanctions to the Palestinian Authority,[43] claiming that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental ""to potential peace talks"".[44] Two years after they stopped paying their dues to UNESCO, US and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected (as a consequence, US was elected as a member of the Executive Board for the period 2016-2019).[45]

This appears to indicate that the US had already pulled funding from UNESCO during the Obama administration and lost voting rights.

What does it mean to pull out completely now and what will this directly affect?"
"How would a wealth tax in the United States be structured, compared to those previously implemented across European countries?","Democratic presidential candidates [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax) and [Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/) have in recent months advocated for a wealth tax on the very rich, promoting it as a progressive tax that can in turn help fund additional progressive policy measures. However, the viability of such a wealth tax has been questioned.^^[\[1\]](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/25/elizabeth-warren-does-her-wealth-tax-pay-her-child/) ^^[\[2\]](https://taxfoundation.org/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-oecd/) ^^[\[3\]](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/facts-on-warrens-wealth-tax-plan/) Critics draw evidence from the flaws realized in such taxes implemented in various European countries, noting concerns about tax evasion, difficulty of wealth evaluation and enforcement, and capital flight and decreased foreign investment. While up to 14 European countries have previously implemented a wealth tax, [only Switzerland, Spain, and Norway still have one in place](https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/dice-report-2018-2-drometer-frank-hofbauer-p%C3%A9rez-rhode-schworm-stitteneder.pdf), although Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy have some form of limited wealth taxation.

If a wealth tax similar to the ones proposed by Senators Warren and Sanders were to be introduced in the United States, what measures would need to be taken to avoid the problems present in current and past wealth taxes in Europe? Proponents of a wealth tax, such as [Professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, argue](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/estimating-the-economic-impact-of-a-wealth-tax/) that the much higher exemption thresholds in Warren's and Sanders' proposals would largely avoid targeting households with high net worth but low liquid assets, and the existence of the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act) makes tax avoidance easier to combat. The OECD also recommends strictly limiting exemptions for assets, which is part of Warren's plan.^^[3] Do these factors adequately address concerns?"
President-elect Trump has struck a deal with Carrier to keep jobs in Indiana. What are the wider implications?,"/r/NeutralPolitics has been getting a lot of submissions on this topic, but none of them quite meet our standards, so the mod team has decided to cobble together the questions and sources from all of them into one post. Thanks to everyone who contributed.

-----

Donald Trump spent much of his presidential campaign pledging to keep manufacturing companies from moving jobs overseas. On Tuesday, air conditioning company [Carrier said it had reached a deal with President-elect Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana.](http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2016/11/29/carrier-trump/94638336/) The state of Indiana plans to [give economic incentives to Carrier](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html) as part of the deal to stay. Though there are obvious benefits of keeping these jobs in the US, Senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders [says it's a bad deal for taxpayers.](http://thehill.com/homenews/news/308242-sanders-carrier-took-trump-hostage-and-won)

So, some questions:

* What are the pros and cons of the deal itself?
* What are the wider implications of the deal? 
* Is there evidence to indicate that a President who takes an interest in individual deals like this can have a substantial effect across the economy? 
* Is it unusual for a President to insert himself into individual negotiations like this, and if so, does it set a precedent?
* Can the working class people who Trump targeted in his campaign see a substantial benefit from moves like this?
* What kinds of wider effects do deals like this — tax incentives in exchange for not moving jobs offshore — have on wealth inequality?
* Do companies like Carrier, who are direct beneficiaries of a tax incentive, end up with a competitive advantage over other players in the marketplace, and if so, what are the pros and cons of that?"
"What are the upsides and criticisms of a ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" plan?","Pete Buttigieg is currently running on a platform that includes [""Medicare for All Who Want It""](https://peteforamerica.com/policies/health-care/), a more moderate alternative to Sanders' and Warren's ""Medicare for All"" plan.

From his website,

>The Medicare for All Who Want It public alternative will help America reach universal coverage by providing an affordable insurance option to the currently uninsured. The public alternative will provide the same essential health benefits as those currently available on the marketplaces and ensure that everyone has access to high-quality, comprehensive coverage.  
>  
>The plan will automatically enroll individuals in affordable coverage if they are eligible for it, while those eligible for subsidized coverage will have a simple enrollment option. A backstop fund will reimburse health care providers for unpaid care to patients who are uninsured. Individuals who fall through the cracks will be retroactively enrolled in the public option.

Proponents of the plan argue that it provides all Americans with affordable healthcare coverage without the expense that comes with replacing private healthcare, and would incentivize private healthcare to keep their prices low. Opponents ([New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/medicare-for-all.html) incoming) argue that: ""the price of health care services — not insurance or pharmaceutical profits — is the primary driver of America’s ballooning health care spending. Only a single-payer system can restrain those costs."" [Conservative critics](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/29/why-pete-buttigiegs-medicare-for-all-who-want-it-is-a-sham/) of the plan seem to fear that it will eventually lead to the elimination of private insurance altogether.

What are the benefits and drawbacks of this type of plan (particularly compared to the Medicare for All and/or our current system)? How feasible is this? I am having trouble finding reliable & detailed arguments for this, since searching ""Medicare for All Who Want It"" usually just returns results about Medicare for All."
How Does President Trump's Invocation of Executive Privilege Today Differ From His Refusal to Invoke Executive Privilege Previously?,"Sorry for the confusing title - for more context:

Today, Donald Trump announced he was asserting executive privilege over the entire Mueller report and the underlying evidence.

[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/congress-contempt-barr.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytpolitics)

> “This is to advise you that the president has asserted executive privilege over the entirety of the subpoenaed materials,” a Justice Department official, Stephen E. Boyd, wrote Wednesday morning, referencing not only the Mueller report but the underlying evidence that House Democrats are seeking.

Previously, after the [Mueller Report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) was published and handed to the Attorney General, the White House was given the opportunity to invoke Executive Privilege with regards to the redacted report.

Donald Trump chose not to.

[source](http://time.com/5571587/white-house-executive-privilege-mueller-report/)

> “Following that review, the President confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the Special Counsel’s report,” he said.

So, my basic question here is ""Does previously not invoking executive privilege in respect to a public disclosure prevent it being invoked later on?""."

The contempt resolution directs the Speaker of the House to certify the report of contempt pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 and 194

Those provisions say:

>[Sec. 192:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/192) Every person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee of either House of Congress, willfully makes default, or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 nor less than $100 and imprisonment in a common jail for not less than one month nor more than twelve months.

>[Sec. 194:](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/194) Whenever a witness summoned as mentioned in section 192 of this title fails to appear to testify or fails to produce any books, papers, rec­ords, or documents, as required, or whenever any witness so summoned refuses to answer any question pertinent to the subject under inquiry before either House, or any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, or any committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress, and the fact of such failure or failures is reported to either House while Congress is in session or when Congress is not in session, a statement of fact constituting such failure is reported to and filed with the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House, it shall be the duty of the said President of the Senate or Speaker of the House, as the case may be, to certify, and he shall so certify, the statement of facts aforesaid under the seal of the Senate or House, as the case may be, to the appropriate United States attorney, whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action.

If the resolution is passed by the Committee and/or the full House, and a referral is made for prosecution, who at the Justice Department would have ultimate say over it?  [DoJ ethics rules](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/government-ethics-outline) require that:

>No DOJ employee may participate in a criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or political relationship with any person or organization substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of the investigation or prosecution, or who would be directly affected by the outcome. 

Since this would be a case of a prosecution decision of Barr, would Barr need to be recused from it?  If he were recused who at DoJ would then make the charging decision?

Would other DoJ officials who participated in the decision also need to recuse?  For example [the letter declining to provide the subpoenaed materials](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Response%20to%20Chairman%20Nadler%20subpoena_1%20May%202019.pdf) is signed by Assistant Attorney General Stephen E.

Does an impeachment inquiry require a full House vote?,"[Recent reports from the White House state that it will not comply with Congressional subpoenas, stating as its rationale that a full House vote has not been conducted to confirm an official impeachment inquiry.](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/white-house-pelosi-letter-wont-cooperate-impeachment-probe) [The House has issued subpoenas to the White House for information pertaining to Trump's solicitation of foreign election interference](https://oversight.house.gov/news/press-releases/white-house-subpoenaed-in-house-impeachment-inquiry).

Does the Constitution require a full House vote for an impeachment inquiry to occur?  Does Pelosi need to wait for the House to return from recess to hold such a vote?

Is Congress able to obtain the subpoenaed information anyway under its powers of [congressional oversight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight#Powers_and_prerogatives)?

Does refusal to comply with the subpoena represent an impeachable offense, [Contempt of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress), under either scenario?


For historical purposes, Contempt of Congress was [Article III in President Nixon's Articles of Impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Richard_Nixon).

> In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, contrary to his oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has failed without lawful cause or excuse to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas issued by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on April 11, 1974, May 15, 1974, May 30, 1974, and June 24, 1974, and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas. The subpoenaed papers and things were deemed necessary by the Committee in order to resolve by direct evidence fundamental, factual questions relating to Presidential direction, knowledge or approval of actions demonstrated by other evidence to be substantial grounds for impeachment of the President. In refusing to produce these papers and things Richard M. Nixon, substituting his judgment as to what materials were necessary for the inquiry, interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives."

What are the legal arguments in support or against President Trump regarding obstructing justice?,"The Senate Intelligence Committee released [James Comey's Statement](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf) for tomorrow's hearing (June 8). Assuming James Comey's statement is truthful and complete, and taking in all known facts and events to date, what are the legal arguments in support or against President Trump regarding obstructing justice? 

There are those who argue that while Trump's behavior amounts to being ""[excessive and bizarre](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448386/james-comey-testimony-donald-trump-actions-are-questionable),"" they do not meet the legal burden of obstruction of justice.

Obstruction of justice is defined under [18 U.S.C. § 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) and committed by those who “[corruptly](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1515), or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation in being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress.”

As [this write up in Lawfare](https://lawfareblog.com/was-firing-james-comey-obstruction-justice) explains (excellent read), there are 3 elements of proof in order to find a crime: 

1. there was a proceeding pending before a department or agency of the United States;
2. the defendant knew of or had a reasonably founded belief that the proceeding was pending
3. the defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which the 
proceeding was pending.

Continuing Lawfare's post:
> The questions here surround the third element. One must not merely “influent, obstruct, or impede” but also do so corruptly. Under § 1515(b), a corrupt state of mind requires intent: “acting with an improper purpose. [...] Ultimately the answer goes to the motives: Did the President or Attorney General intend for Comey’s firing to “influence, obstruct, or impede” the Russia investigation? ”

I'm sure we can debate that as its own topic, but I'm curious as to the lawfulness of the situation. And Donald Trump Jr.'s [retweet of the story](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/873916847191724033) brings up for me, an interesting point.     

Even with the context of the play and the play's ultimate message (the story has much more to do with the assassins' and conspirators' downfall from their folly than it does with the passing moment of Caesar's brutal murder onstage) I'm curious about at what point does the artful expression become a political statement, and are protections afforded for that?    

EDIT: Removed an unsupported assertion."
"What is the goal of ""burqa bans"" and are they effective in achieving that goal?","It seems that [Denmark](http://m.independent.ie/world-news/denmark-set-to-become-latest-european-country-to-ban-the-burqa-36203002.html) will become the latest country, joining France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, and the German state Bavaria, to have some level of ""burqa ban"". Burqa bans, for the purposes of this question, include the legislation in France banning the wearing of face coverings in public(It's hard to find the text in english, but [this source](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/france-law-prohibiting-the-wearing-of-clothing-concealing-ones-face-in-public-spaces-found-constitutional/) gives ""The law reviewed by the Constitutional Council provides that 'no one, in a public space, may wear clothing intended to conceal the face.'""), the potential ban in Denmark that is not written yet, but seems to be along the lines of the French one and any other legislation in western countries that has had similar effect(most burqa bans seem to be part of larger public face-covering bans). 

The most stated popular reasonings behind the ban appear to be [social cohesion, or protecting women's rights](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/19/europe/burqa-burkini-bans/index.html) and [security, or the suppression of radical islam](http://www.newsweek.com/burqa-ban-european-peoples-party-france-582312), though some wearers of the garments say the problems are being made up.

So, before bans were put in place [around 2010-11](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/14/headscarves-and-muslim-veil-ban-debate-timeline), was there any reason to believe that the bans would result in greater social cohesion, security, or women's rights? After the bans is there reason to believe the countries that implemented them have had greater security, social cohesion or women's rights than they would have had otherwise?"
Why hasn't the mainstream media been more sceptical of claims of Russian meddling with our election?,"A lot of the larger media outlets now implicitly refer to ""Russian hacking"" and report it near absolute with very little skeptism. See:

However, many security experts who are highly respected in their fields have read the reports released and are expressing a great deal of scepticism. This has been fairly well covered in the technology industry:

[This is the text of the agreement.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/27_04_2018_korean_declaration.pdf)

Questions:

* Were any substantive agreements made at this summit?
* How does this summit compare to the prior Inter-Korean summits?
* How, if at all, did the foreign policy of other nations contribute to this summit?
* What progress was made towards future talks?

What is the core of the debate over releasing (or not releasing) some of Brett Kavanaugh's records?,"Usually I'm pretty good at digging into issues like this and finding a reasonable explanation for at least one of the sides of a debate. But recently I've seen [articles](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/us/politics/kavanaugh-records.html) about a debate over some of Brett Kavanaugh's record, and I can't seem to find much of a basis for either side's arguments. I'm hoping that there's some more information out there that I'm missing to help me out with a few of my questions:

1) What is the role of the White House staff secretary, and how might documents generated by someone in that position be relevant to a confirmation hearing for a SCOTUS position? 

2) To what extent are the documents being withheld? All documents from his time as staff secretary, some, or are they only withholding them until they can be screened for sensitive information?

The Panama Papers: What do they tell us about the international financial system?,"Recently, [over 11 million files were leaked](http://www.npr.org/2016/04/03/472890948/with-leak-of-panama-papers-a-glimpse-of-worlds-fiscal-underbelly) from a law firm based in Panama, revealing a broad international network of shady financial dealings. The leaks provide evidence for significant movements of illicit money around the world, including [12 world leaders and a wide range of other important officials and their relatives](https://projects.icij.org/panama-papers/power-players/?lang=en) from nations as diverse as Russia, the UK, Sudan, Rwanda and Iceland. One [especially tantalizing finding](http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/all-the-presidents-men-vladimir-putins-secret-money-network/) was the uncovering of a $2 billion network connected to Vladimir Putin.

The law firm in question, Mossack Fonseca, is, according to NPR, one of the largest incorporators in the world, involved in the process of setting up shell corporations and offshore accounts. While neither activity is illegal, both are [frequently used](https://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/files/LLCAssessment_FINAL.pdf) to facilitate financial fraud.

While the leaks are still fairly recent and thus, thorough analysis still difficult to find, preliminary reports implicate a huge number of officials from nations rich and poor, democratic and autocratic alike. While officials in [Brazil](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21695391-tarnished-president-should-now-resign-time-go?zid=305&ah=417bd5664dc76da5d98af4f7a640fd8a) and [Russia](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-News/2016/0126/How-corrupt-is-Russia) have long been suspected of major corrupt activity, the papers also suggest significant fraud in nations like the UK and Iceland, among others. 

In light of this, what can we conclude about the global financial system? Attempts [have been made in the past](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21672232-europes-corporate-tax-havens-say-they-are-reforming-up-point-still-slipping-net) to eliminate tax havens and crack down on money laundering on the international level--what more can be done to this end?

Can the Democratic Party replace Joe Biden as its nominee for the presidential election?,"[Joe Biden is the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for the presidential race and other major candidates have already suspended their campaigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-presidential-delegates-tracker/), but the national convention where the nominee will be officially chosen is still [three months away](https://www.wisn.com/article/dnc-convention-delayed-to-august-due-to-coronavirus/32018109). In light of [a developing controversy about a sexual assault allegation against Biden](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/woman-broadens-claims-against-biden-include-sexual-assault-n1182296), Elizabeth Bruenig [writes in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/opinion/joe-biden-tara-reade.html) that Democrats need to ""consider a plan B"":

> I have my own impressions regarding Ms. Reade’s allegations, but no one — save Ms. Reade and Mr. Biden — knows with certainty whether her claims are true. What I can assert with firm conviction is that Democrats ought to start considering a backup plan for 2020. 

If Democrats do change their minds and no longer think Biden is their strongest candidate for the November election, this raises several questions about their other options:

* Procedurally, how would it work? If Biden withdraws, does the nomination automatically go to the runner-up (currently Bernie Sanders), or are the delegates pledged to Biden reassigned in some way?
* If Biden doesn't choose to withdraw voluntarily, can the party disqualify him anyway, within its current rules?
* If Biden receives the nomination and names a running mate, but he departs the race before Election Day, can he still be replaced or is his former running mate then the effective presidential candidate?
* How much leverage the remaining state primary elections hold if Democratic voters quickly change their mind about Biden?
* What is the timeline of when certain options become impossible for the Democratic Party?

---

late EDIT: my previous phrasing was incorrect because the other candidates have [suspended their campaigns but not officially withdrawn](https://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/10/what-does-suspending-mean-2/), so Biden could theoretically withdraw in a more real sense than his former rivals have done, which might have implications for party procedure"
"What are the merits of the US Government's lawsuit against California regarding ""sanctuary"" policies?","Yesterday the US Government filed [a lawsuit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYcws2UaSH9wdoQjDBaJRluY6pJuijbJ/view) against the State of California which asks for a Federal court to bar enforcement of three California laws.

Those laws are:

* [**AB-450**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB450) which requires in relevant part that California employers not provide information to Federal immigration agents, or allow them access to nonpublic areas, except as required by federal law or when presented with a warrant, subpoena or other court order.

* [**AB-103**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB103) which requires  the Attorney General of California, or his or her designee, to engage in reviews of county, local, or private locked detention facilities in which noncitizens are being housed or detained for purposes of civil immigration proceedings in California.

* [**SB-54**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54) which prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from sharing information with the US government around immigrants in California custody, or transferring them to Federal custody, with some exceptions for certain listed felonies, and for when a judicial warrant or judicial probable cause determination is presented to California authorities.

The DoJ argues that these laws are invalid under the [supremacy clause of the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/supremacy_clause)  because they ""reflect a deliberate effort by
California to obstruct the United States’ enforcement of federal immigration law.""

In a recent similar case, one of the Federal laws the DoJ is asking to be found supreme [was found to be unconstitutional](http://www.cand.uscourts.gov/who/sanctuary-litigation) under the 10th amendment by a US District Court. (That page is a general case page, the order granting motion for summary judgment is the court order.)"
Can the Vice President force legislation from the U.S. House of Representatives before the U.S. Senate for a vote?,"Article I, Clause 4 of the U.S. Constitution provides that ""The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided."" That's pretty much it for the defined roles of the Vice President. When acting as the President of the Senate, the VP's role is subject to the Senate's rules.

Per Senate Rule VII ""MORNING BUSINESS"" Part 3 [Rules of the Senate](https://www.rules.senate.gov/rules-of-the-senate),
>The Presiding Officer may at any time lay, and it shall be in order at any time for a Senator to move to lay, before the Senate, any bill or other matter sent to the Senate by the President or the House of Representatives for appropriate action allowed under the rules and any question pending at that time shall be suspended for this purpose. Any motion so made shall be determined without debate.

(When acting as President of the Senate, the Vice President is by definition the Presiding Officer.)

Specifically for the Presiding Officer, the text says, ""The Presiding Officer may at any time lay ... before the Senate, any bill or other matter sent to the Senate by ... the House of Representatives for appropriate action allowed under the rules..."" As near as I can tell, this means the bill goes directly before the Senate (instead of coming up for a motion to be considered like when legislation is submitted by a Senator).

The Senate Majority Leader can apparently refuse to allow bills before the Senate for a vote through the various ways the role of Presiding Officer is delegated by the Rules of the Senate, but it seems to me that the rules also imply that if he or she is presiding the Vice President can place a bill from the House on the calendar for a vote. I'm sure I'm missing something, since keyword searches will only get me so far through the parlimentary mess that is the Senate rules. Thoughts?"
Does Bannon Need Senate Approval to Join the National Security Council?,"We all are likely aware that President Trump signed an Executive Order [giving Steve Bannon a permanent spot on the National Security Council.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/stephen-bannon-donald-trump-national-security-council.html).

 [According to a piece in the Palmer Report](http://www.palmerreport.com/opinion/trump-apparently-didnt-realize-steve-bannon-will-need-senate-confirmation-security-council/1282/) (I'm uncertain to its credibility), Bannon may now have to go through Senate approval because he doesn't meet the criteria of the five per-approved groups:

> According to section (a)(6) of federal statute 50 U.S. Code 3021, a civilian like Steve Bannon will in fact need to go through Senate confirmation and approval in order to serve on the National Security Council because he doesn’t fit into any of the five listed pre-approved categories. That obscure law, which has remained obscure because no president has ever tried to put a political hack on the NSC until now, was dug up by MSNBC analyst Jonathan Alter late on Monday night. 

I looked up the law ([located here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/3021)) and while it does specify the groups expected to be included I see no mention that falling outside of these pre-established roles subjects Bannon to Senate scrutiny. So, given other rules regarding Senate oversight does Bannon now need to have a confirmation hearing in front of the Senate?"

Its [mission](https://www.ice.gov/about) is to enforce federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration to promote homeland security and public safety.


Recently, some Democratic candidates have [laid out arguments](https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-to-abolish-ice/) for abolishing the agency and a number of others have [gotten behind the idea.](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-democrats-ice-analysis-20180624-story,amp.html) Here's a [full explainer.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17116980/ice-abolish-immigration-arrest-deport)

"The US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 appears to have a disqualification clause, in addition to and separate from conviction, possibly not requiring the extra hurdle of a 2/3rds majority. Could this be used in the impeachment of Donald Trump?","Speaking of the powers and duties of the Senate, the [US Constitution Article 1 Section 3 states](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript#toc-section-3-):

> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, **and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States**: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. 

[Justia provides some further background](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/49-judgment-removal-and-disqualification.html), speaking of the link between conviction and removal:

> the Senate determined that removal is automatic upon conviction, and does not require a separate vote... only as a result of a two-thirds vote.

it further states for disqualification:

> **Unlike removal, disqualification from office is a discretionary judgment, and there is no explicit constitutional linkage to the two-thirds vote on conviction. Although an argument can be made that disqualification should nonetheless require a two-thirds vote, the Senate has determined that disqualification may be accomplished by a simple majority vote**

Many seem to think it unlikely that enough Republicans in the Senate will break rank from the party and vote in favor of convicting Donald Trump for anything. However, should disqualification be brought to the table, it may only require a simple majority and therefore only 4 Republican Senators to break party rank.

* How does disqualification get proposed?
* When has disqualification been used separate from conviction in the past?
* Are Democrats aware of/think disqualification would be a viable strategy?
* Would successful disqualification actually prevent Donald Trump from running for reelection?
* What is the role of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell? For example, like other actions in the Senate, can he choose if disqualification can get brought to the floor for vote during impeachment?"

Would Turkey Be Justified in Kidnapping or Drone-Killing Fethullah Gulen in Pennsylvania?,"Good morning everyone. I lifted the subject of this discussion directly from [an article by Glenn Greenwald that appears this morning on *The Intercept.*](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/18/would-turkey-be-justified-in-kidnapping-or-drone-killing-the-turkish-cleric-in-pennsylvania/) 

To summarize- in this article Greenwald argues a kind of moral equivalence between the United States' use of military drones to kill suspected terrorists in the ME and a hypothetical action by Turkey to assassinate Fathullah Gulen in Pennsylvania. (Gulen is the cleric Erdogan claims is responsible for Friday's failed military coup in Turkey. He has been living in the USA since 1999, despite repeated requests by Erdogan that he be extradited.)

Greenwald concludes his article with a harsh rebuke of what he describes as an American ""pathology"":

>U.S. drone kills of terror suspects (including its own citizens) are extremely popular among Americans, including (in the age of Obama) those who self-identify as liberal Democrats. Yet it’s virtually certain that Americans across the ideological spectrum would explode in nationalistic outrage if Turkey actually did the same thing in Pennsylvania... 

> Indeed, so ingrained is this pathology that the mere suggestion that the U.S. should be subject to the same laws and rules as everyone else inevitably provokes indignant accusations that the person is guilty of the greatest sin: comparing the United States of America to the lesser, inferior governments and countries of the world.

So clearly this is a pretty provocative piece of writing, which not only touches on the news of the day but also addresses a persistent undercurrent in the national debate regarding how the United States should prosecute the offensive against terrorists abroad. 

Here is some background reading that might be helpful: 

[Wiki on the drone program in Pakistan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan)

"Democrats have introduced their long expected ""Green New Deal."" Now that the plan is public, what's in it?

Formally called *Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal*, it can be found in several places in full - [here it is hosted by NPR](https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=5729033-Green-New-Deal-FINAL) (PDF warning).

I have a couple of questions:

1: What is the substance of the Green New Deal? What measures does it call for to reduce carbon output, create jobs, and reduce or eradicate poverty? What other goals does the legislation have?

2: What data is being used to demonstrate that these measures will accomplish these goals?

Why does every Virginia governor issue an executive order banning forms of discrimination that are already illegal under both federal and state law?,"Every governor of Virginia since Linwood Holton has signed an executive order banning the state workforce from engaging in racial, religious, or sex-based discrimination.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832) Recent governors have expanded these executive orders to include further protections, some of which are not currently covered by federal or state law, such as protections on the basis of sexual orientation and on the basis of gender identity.[[1]](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013102083_2.html?sid=ST2010020803832)[[2]](
https://augustafreepress.com/lieutenant-governor-northam-casts-tiebreaking-vote-end-employment-discrimination-state-government/)

I'm not familiar with how to read legal documents, but if I'm understanding [this page](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-human-rights-act/) correctly, it seems that Virginia may not have had any anti-discrimination laws until the 1980s. Holton took office in 1970, and so considering Virginia's history of racial discrimination, Holton's executive order likely made an impact, even though racial discrimination was already illegal under federal law at the time. 

But as that Virginia.gov page I just linked to clearly shows, in the time since Holton's governorship, Virginia has passed a state law banning racial, religious, and gender-based discrimination. So it's unclear to me why these protections are still included in executive orders. The protection against anti-LGBT discrimination still serves a clear legal purpose. But why does the governor still have to issue an executive order banning, say, racial discrimination, if racial discrimination is illegal under both federal and state law? Is this done solely for symbolic purposes? Or does it have any practical impact? 

Making matter even more confusing, the Virginia legislature has recently attempted, unsuccessfully, to codify these executive orders into state law.[[4]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0)[[5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-house-panel-kills-bills-to-ban-anti-lgbt-discrimination-in-housing-and-jobs/2018/02/08/17051270-0d15-11e8-8b0d-891602206fb7_story.html?utm_term=.cc3b3bd8324d) Most of the news coverage about this has focused on the fact that such legislation, if passed, would ban LGBT discrimination in Virginia. But a few of the news articles that I've seen, such as this one [[6]](https://www.wvtf.org/post/tie-breaking-vote-sends-employment-discrimination-bill-forward#stream/0), explicitly state that the proposed legislation would codify all of the protections that have been offered under these executive orders, including those protections that are *already* codified as part of existing  state law. 

So as with the executive orders, I can see why the anti-LGBT discrimination portion of this proposed legislation would serve a purpose. But the parts of this legislation having to do with racial discrimination, religious discrimination, etc. seem to be redundant to existing state law.

It seems like the legislature could propose a law simply banning LGBT discrimination, rather than proposing a law that would ban, in addition to LGBT discrimination, a bunch of things that have already been banned in Virginia. 

I know that this is a really specific, wonky question, and so I'm not sure that anyone will be able to answer it. But does anyone know why -

1. Virginia governors continue to issue executive orders banning things that are already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of issuing executive orders that are solely focused on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

2. the Virginia legislature has proposed legislation that would ban things already illegal under both federal and state law, instead of proposing legislation that would solely focus on banning anti-LGBT discrimination? 

Is there some very subtle thing that I'm not understanding here? Or like I suggested earlier, is this simply being done for symbolic purposes? 

Thanks!"

Can Brett Kavanaugh be charged with perjury?,"In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, Brett Kavanaugh was asked about terms in his yearbook like “Devil’s Triangle” and “boofed”.

"Under the 1996 federal Communications Decency Act, online publishers are immune from liability for third-party content. What are the pros and cons of eliminating this immunity?","[Links posted to demonstrate underlying sentiments exist, not as a source of their truth.]

In lieu of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica breach / misuse of data, there has been a general clamor to better address online user-generated content. ProPublica has posted [four proposals](https://www.propublica.org/article/four-ways-to-fix-facebook), one of which (#3) included updating the 1996 federal Communications Decency Act to remove immunity from liability for published third-party content.

This proposal deals less with privacy and more with the questionable substantive content posted on Internet platforms such as Facebook. The [historical justification](https://www.law.com/therecorder/sites/therecorder/2017/11/10/cda-230-then-and-now-does-intermediary-immunity-keep-the-rest-of-us-healthy/) for immunity was an acknowledgment that Internet businesses were an emerging technology that needed room to breath in order to flourish, and that liability would effectively quash their ability to scale writ large:

>This strange medium-specific subsidy for online content platforms made good if not perfect sense in 1996. (My generally positive thinking about it from that time, including some reservations, can be found here.) The Internet was newly mainstream, and many content portals comprised the proverbial two people in a garage. To impose upon them the burdens of traditional media would presumably require tough-to-maintain gatekeeping. Comments sections, if they remained at all, would have to be carefully screened to avoid creating liability for the company. What made sense for a newspaper publishing at most five or six letters a day amidst its more carefully vetted articles truly couldn’t work for a small Internet startup processing thousands or even millions of comments or other contributions in the same interval. Over time, the reviews elicited by Yelp and TripAdvisor, the financial markets discussions on Motley Fool, the evolving articles on user-edited Wikipedia—all are arguably only possible thanks to that §230 immunity conferred in 1996.

The present argument for removing that liability is an acknowledged change in this landscape, namely that the Internet companies have gotten better at operating at scale, with many of the big players having requisite resources to better manage content and deal with liability claims if they fail to perform:

>Perhaps the evolution of the merits of equal treatment for state sales tax provides a good model for a refined CDA: companies below a certain size or activity threshold could benefit from its immunities, while those who grow large enough to facilitate the infliction of that much more damage from defamatory and other actionable posts might also have the resources to employ a compliance department. That would militate towards at least some standard to meet in vetting or dealing with posts, perhaps akin to the light duties of booksellers or newsstands towards the wares they stock rather than the higher ones of newspapers towards the letters they publish.

In contrast, organizations like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) contend that s. 230 is the cornerstone of Internet speech protection:

>[It] would be infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site. Rather than face potential liability for their users' actions, most would likely not host any user content at all or would need to protect themselves by being actively engaged in censoring what we say, what we see, and what we do online. In short, CDA 230 is perhaps the most influential law to protect the kind of innovation that has allowed the Internet to thrive since 1996.

>CDA 230 also offers its legal shield to bloggers who act as intermediaries by hosting comments on their blogs. Under the law, bloggers are not liable for comments left by readers, the work of guest bloggers, tips sent via email, or information received through RSS feeds. This legal protection can still hold even if a blogger is aware of the objectionable content or makes editorial judgments.

[META] Seeking feedback on how to handle submissions from OP with an agenda that are otherwise compliant with the rules,"Dear users,

Recently we have approved several posts of a generally rules-compliant question where it was later revealed by OP's interactions with users in the comments that the purpose was to promote and defend a particular narrative. Many users complained that OP was acting in bad faith and that the framing of the post was not neutral, even if a literal reading of it seemed to be.

The mods are looking for feedback on what to do about such submissions. As it stands now, we're obligated to approve them, since otherwise we could rightly be accused of not complying with the rules and standards we have set.

But changing the rules to account specifically for this phenomenon would add an element of discretion. We would go from just looking at compliance with the language and source rules to also determining whether we believed the OP was posting in good faith to get answers to the questions they were posing. This would introduce an avenue for bias, or at least open us up to accusations of bias.

So, we'd first like to know if the users think this is a big problem on NP? And if so, do you have suggestions on how we should address it?"

I take away a few things from the articles above:

* There's a growing sense among voters in the west that the winners from globalization are foreigners and the elites, while the losers are the hardworking local populations. 
* The result is that populism is on the rise.
* Left-wing and right-wing populism have the same origins. Considering them separate entities is to misunderstand the root causes.
* The power of these movements has been consistently underestimated by the political classes and the media entities who respond to them. Brexit and the nomination of Donald Trump are the clearest examples, but Spain, Greece, France and Denmark also have had recent cases of the ruling classes scrambling to maintain their hold on power in the face of populist revolts at the ballot box.
* The people, by and large, aren't buying the scary rhetoric of the ruling class about the negative consequences of setting out a populist and/or nationalist agenda.

I'd first like to know if any of those are incorrect conclusions and why.

But my main question is whether populism is the inevitable result of globalization or if there is a path that lowers trade and immigration barriers, but doesn't necessarily lead to the sense of citizen disenfranchisement that encourages populist uprisings?

Let me be clear that I'm not passing judgment on populism here. If that is a necessary and expedient path to fair and equitable treatment of the citizenry, so be it. But [the history doesn't consistently favor that view,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism) so I'm wondering if there are proven alternatives.

...

> Mueller’s 448-page report, released publicly in April, found Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election and that Republican President Donald Trump’s election campaign had multiple contacts with Russian officials.
> 
> But the report found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow.
> 
> The report, which was partially redacted, also outlined instances in which Trump tried to interfere with Mueller’s investigation, but declined to make a judgment on whether that amounted to obstruction of justice.
> 
> Mueller, in his first public comments since starting the two-year investigation, said on May 29 that his probe was never going to end with criminal charges against Trump and indicated it was up to Congress to decide whether he should be impeached.

For what purpose? Were you contemplating possible prosecution of the president by future prosecutors, once he left office?""

The Trump administration has imposed a 30% tariff on imported solar panels. What are the arguments for and against this?,"http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/370171-trump-imposes-30-tariffs-on-solar-panel-imports

According to this article:

>The Solar Energy Industries Association predicted the tariffs would increase prices and kill 23,000 jobs. The group represents manufacturers as well as installers, sellers and others in the field.

>“While tariffs in this case will not create adequate cell or module manufacturing to meet U.S. demand, or keep foreign-owned Suniva and SolarWorld afloat, they will create a crisis in a part of our economy that has been thriving, which will ultimately cost tens of thousands of hard-working, blue-collar Americans their jobs,” Abigail Ross Hopper, the group's president, said in a statement. 

>Suniva and SolarWorld Americas, the bankrupt companies which requested the tariffs, say tariffs would boost domestic manufacturing and add more than 100,000 jobs.

So is this a net gain or a net loss for American jobs, and what is the likely effect on the solar power industry in the U.S. and abroad?"
Is there evidence suggesting the most effective set of policies for the use of police body cameras?,"The United States is three years into the spike in adoption of police body cameras and [studies show some unexpected results.](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2019/0809/The-body-cam-revolution-What-it-has-and-hasn-t-accomplished) 

Rather than focus on the use of the cameras themselves, I'm really curious about the specific policies related to their use, because they [vary greatly from state to state,](https://apps.urban.org/features/body-camera-update/) which should provide us with some data about what works and what doesn't, but I'm not able to find anything.

Some of the [ways in which the policies vary](https://www.brennancenter.org/body-cam-city-map) are the time non-evidentiary video is kept; limits on recording victims, witnesses, or private situations; and whether an officer may view video before making report or statement.

One of the biggest issues is how and when the footage should be released. According to the [National Conference of State Legislatures](http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/body-worn-cameras-interactive-graphic.aspx#/), laws in some states treat body camera recordings as public records, but provide standards and many caveats for when police may withhold, redact or obscure certain videos. Laws in other states exclude body-worn camera footage from open record requests, but provide several exceptions that enable access to videos by specific persons or for specific situations.

The goal of these provisions is to be transparent in law enforcement without unnecessarily infringing on privacy, because many [crime victims and witnesses who cooperate with police, as well as peaceful protestors, do not want to be filmed.](https://www.aclu.org/other/police-body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all) This also affects the decision to make such recordings continuous or allow officers to turn the cameras on and off, which is [another issue of hot debate.](https://www.ibtimes.com/what-happens-when-police-turn-their-body-cameras-2050118)

So, is there evidence that any particular mix of policies incentivizes better outcomes, such as less police misconduct, better community relations with law enforcement, and more justified prosecutorial decisions? If not, are there studies in progress looking at these issues? The variety of policies in place seems like a nearly ideal situation to examine their effects."

Should America move away from a First Past the Post voting system?,"As we have seen for decades deadlocked government in the United states has been a major issue. The two parties that wield all the influence in our nation have become more [polarized](http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/) as their electorates become more frustrated with the government.

As we have seen this election the polarization of the electorate has become particularly intense as presidential candidates have been using the anger of the electorate to gain support. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders,in their own ways, have been using populist anger to gain a massive amount of support this election cycle.

However, [half of Americans still don't think that their vote matters](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/03/04/half-of-those-who-arent-learning-about-the-election-feel-their-vote-doesnt-matter/) in this election and coupled with only a [small minority that actually trusts our government](http://www.people-press.org/2015/11/23/beyond-distrust-how-americans-view-their-government/), people just aren't satisfied. Personally, I believe that shouldn't happen in a nation that [many pride ](http://dailysignal.com/2015/07/04/are-americans-still-patriotic-what-polls-reveal/)  as the best in the world. If anything the fact that our constitutional republic, the government that is supposed to be by the people and for the people has such [low approval ratings](http://www.gallup.com/poll/171992/americans-losing-confidence-branches-gov.aspx) shows a fundamental flaw in our democracy.

The flaw seems to be in the one of the most fundamental aspects of our voting system, First past the post. [The problems with FPTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo) are commonly known. [Gerrymandering](http://politicsandpolicy.org/article/gerrymandering-proving-all-politics-local), where the parties in control can redraw the districts in their favor so that even if they do not get the majority of the vote they can still win the election. The spoiler effect, the idea that even if a third party gained massive amounts of popularity they would only take [away votes from the major party that have the most in common](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/11/the-midterm-elections-spoilers/382475/) with and will lead to the other major party succeeding leading to the third party never gaining the same level of support. These issues lead to the rise of only two political parties, which are [umbrella parties for a range of political beliefs](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/), which don't really satisfy anyone. 

So should we change from FPTP to another type of voting system? Would it change the deadlock we see in American government today?

[ Also for anyone interested here is an opinion piece I found that was interesting and provided a look at America with a new type of voting system though it was written 20 years ago so the ideas on the parties would probably change.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/01/a-closer-look-at-who-identifies-as-democrat-and-republican/) "
How was a federal judge able to rule the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional when the Supreme Court originally said it was not unconstitutional? What does this mean moving forward?,"A federal judge in Texas rules that the individual mandate of the ACA is now unconstitutional because in the 2017 tax bill, the penalty for being uninsured was wiped to $0. (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-15/obamacare-core-provisions-ruled-unconstitutional-by-judge)

The article says that the rationale beind it was that with no penalty for non-compliance, there can't be a mandate, which doesn't make sense to me because in Department of Health and Human Services v Florida (i.e. the SCOTUS case in 2011) they ruled the ACA as constitutional because the mandate penalty is considered a tax. (http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/u-s-department-of-health-and-human-services-v-florida/).

Why would temporarily eliminating the mandate make the law Unconstitutional? What does this mean for Health Insurance in the next year? Are other parts of the act such as forbidding the denial of coverage based on pre-existing conditions no longer law?

What does current evidence and analysis say about the economic effect of a minimum wage increase?,"[Pew Research reports](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/) that the Federal minimum wage has lost nearly 10% of its purchasing power in the last decade due to inflation, with less than half (45%) of workers in that margin composed of workers that would be considered young, new entrants into the workforce (16-25 years old).

From this, one could infer that more than half of the hourly workforce is past the point that a job paying higher than minimum would be expected, i.e. 'work experience,' with [most salaried workers receiving a three percent raise annually](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0516/Pages/0516-fair-compensation.aspx).

One of the many [chief arguments opposing a wage increase](http://www.aei.org/publication/ten-reasons-economists-object-to-the-minimum-wage/) is that increasing such a wage may drive retailers to increase their prices to recoup the costs, defeating the purpose of a wage increase if said increase is to amp up the spending power of the labor class.

However, [as anecdotally reported by CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/21/adjusted-for-inflation-the-federal-minimum-wage-is-worth-less-than-50-years-ago.html) in the case of a Pennsylvania-based restaurant chain's $1.50 wage increase to minimum wage workers, spending power of the restaurant owner's employees was increased while his profits remained relatively unaffected, inferred by him to be because the employees were able to spend more money both at his restaurants as well as in other local chains."

The mods here feel like it's time for some reminders about how this subreddit is run.

Primarily, as we write at the top of every post:

> /r/NeutralPolitics is a curated space. 

> In order not to get your comment removed, please familiarize yourself with our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) before you participate.

A lot of people seem to ignore this, but we're begging you… **please read the rules!**

Now, here are a few refreshers on the specifics…

**Why are sources required?**

The requirement to provide sources for all assertions of fact (Rule 2) is part of the [founding ethos of this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) Many things people believe to be true are, in fact, not. Providing sources is the best way to support your assertions. It is our cornerstone philosophy.

**How to handle requests for sources.**

Commenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith. What may seem ""obvious"" or ""common sense"" to you is often not to others. So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to support your statement, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. They're not an assault or a challenge. Think of them as an invitation to provide knowledge.

**""You can just google it.""**

No. It's the responsibility of the person making the claim to support it. It's also far more efficient for the one person making the assertion to link to the source than to charge thousands of individual readers with supporting it.

**There's no exception for ""common knowledge.""**

[This is explicitly stated in the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) because ""common knowledge"" is poorly defined and completely subjective. What qualifies as common knowledge to one person might be a shocking fact to another. For example, people who are new to a topic or are from cultures other than the dominant one in the discussion may have no idea about these supposedly ""common"" pieces of knowledge.

Additionally, statements of ""common knowledge"" are often wrong. The fact that a large number of people may believe something has [no bearing on whether or not it's true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)

We occasionally get pushback from users on this point, and it often takes the form of something like, ""Do I have to source that the sky is blue?"" This is a convenient example for a few reasons:

1. The sky is *not* blue. It only looks that way to us because of [human physiology](https://www.livescience.com/320-blue-skies-eye-beholder.html) and how the [light scatters through the atmosphere.](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/)
2. Even at that, it doesn't always appear blue. It's red and orange at sunrise and sunset, white on an overcast day, gray when there are rain clouds, and black at night.
3. Finally, this is a political discussion forum, so any assertion about the color of the sky is likely to be removed for being off topic. The same goes for similar examples, like ""water is wet."" When we get into political topics, there's actually much *less* agreement on what constitutes common knowledge, so we don't accept any of it.

**Removal reasons (we don't always post them)**

The mods try to reply with a reason for each removed comment. However, users have repeatedly complained that heavily redacted threads get crowded with removal reasons, making it hard to find the actual content. 

That in mind, there are some situations where we don't post them. The most common is when they're in a chain that is off-topic or stemming from a rule-violating comment. In that case, we'll just nuke the whole chain rather than post a dozen or so removal reasons. Comments that are just obvious trolling, spam or repeats may also be removed without notice.

What this means is that you might not notice if your comment is removed. The best way to avoid this is to not violate the [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in the first place, but if you have any doubt, you can also check the public mod logs.

**Public mod logs**

In the interest of transparency, moderation logs are public on r/NeutralPolitics. We have [our own system](https://modlogs.fyi/r/NeutralPolitics) (there's also a link in the sidebar) or you can use [ceddit](https://www.ceddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics).


That's all. Feel free to post your questions or comments below.

DoJ brief argues that sexual orientation is not protected under Title VII. What does this actually mean?,"IANAL, and so I see something like [this brief](https://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/legal-docs/ny_zarda_20170726_doj-amicus-brief) reported on with a big flashy headline and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. It seems like this *could* be effectively an argument that discrimination based on sexual orientation should be totally OK, but it could also be a lot more strictly limited than that, and I don't have the legal knowledge to really be sure. 

[Here](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/07/28/us/politics/28reuters-usa-court-lgbt.html) is some less-legal-jargony coverage from NYT/Reuters, but again I'm not really sure what the actual impact of such a ruling would be."
Is it legal (under U.S. law) for Hunter Biden to have served on the board of Burisma Holdings (a politically sensitive natural gas producer in Ukraine) while Joe Biden was vice-president of the U.S.?,"Burisma Holdings is a Ukrainian natural gas producer. It holds 35 government concessions to produce hydrocarbons (per Reuters, see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-burisma-factb/factbox-burisma-the-obscure-ukrainian-gas-company-at-the-heart-of-us-political-row-idUSKBN1W91UG)

It has been alleged that the owner of Burisma— Mykola Zlochevsky, the former ecology minister of Ukraine— was able to secure the concessions from the Ukrainian government via some corrupt means. (I heard on NPR this morning and found this NYT article with some broad strokes on this saga but does not address the concessions directly: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)

Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in April 2014 and was allegedly paid up to $50k per month for his services. Hunter had tested positive for cocaine and was discharged from a ceremonial post with the U.S. Navy in February 2014. He remained on the Burisma board until April of this year. (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)

He is a Yale educated lawyer who did some lobbying work while his father was in the Senate. What specific expertise did he bring to bear on the governance of a natural gas company in Ukraine?

I have seen some reporting that Ukrainian officials looked into this and said Hunter broke no Ukrainian laws. There is no legal limit in Ukraine on board compensation. (https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/joe-biden-and-son-hunter-cleared-of-wrongdoing-by-ukraine-prosecutor/) But how is that relevant? Why is that the standard?

I don’t know if Biden’s conduct runs afoul of any U.S. laws. Is it legal?"

"Has the war in Afghanistan been a success, a failure, or otherwise, and why?","Recent polling by Pew [suggests](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/05/after-17-years-of-war-in-afghanistan-more-say-u-s-has-failed-than-succeeded-in-achieving-its-goals/) that half of Americans consider the [17-year-old](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/afghan-war-now-longest-war-us-history/story?id=10849303) US-led coalition intervention in Afghanistan a failure, with only a third remaining optimistic.

Credible claims that the US position in Afghanistan is not salvageable go back to [at least 2013](https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/15/the-real-reason-the-u-s-failed-in-afghanistan/), four years after the Obama ""surge"" [deployed](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484979294/chart-how-the-u-s-troop-levels-in-afghanistan-have-changed-under-obama) an additional 30,000 troops to the country. 

By 2016, US troop numbers in Afghanistan were down to around 5,000-10,000, [down](https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484979294/chart-how-the-u-s-troop-levels-in-afghanistan-have-changed-under-obama) from nearly 100,000 at its peak in 2011. According to Pentagon estimates, the war has [cost](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/pentagon-says-afghan-war-costs-taxpayers-45-billion-per-year) an average of $45 billion a year, with some thirty thousand civilians [killed](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2016/War%20in%20Afghanistan%20and%20Pakistan%20UPDATE_FINAL_corrected%20date.pdf) as of 2016. The US seems to have [officially shifted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/15/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-direct-negotiations.html) towards encouraging negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, whose government was toppled in 2001.

[Some commentators](https://www.heritage.org/middle-east/commentary/no-we-have-not-failed-afghanistan-heres-why-the-us-should-stay) have encouraged continued intervention, citing terrorism and security concerns.

What is the basis for for arguing ISP's have 1st Amendment right to block websites?,"I saw this article on the recent supreme court nominee about his [dissent on a case about the FCC’s 2015 net neutrality rule.](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/net-neutrality-rules-are-illegal-according-to-trumps-supreme-court-pick/)

Knowing sometimes it can be hard to accurately summarize someones legal position I looked at his actual [dissent](https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/06F8BFD079A89E13852581130053C3F8/$file/15-1063-1673357.pdf). In it he argues the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rule is inconsequential for two reasons, of which the second reason I am interested about. 

> Second and in the alternative, the net neutrality rule
> violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Under
> the Supreme Court’s landmark decisions in Turner
> Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), and

> (1997), the First Amendment bars the Government from

> possesses market power in a relevant geographic market.
> Here, however, the FCC has not even tried to make a market
> power showing. Therefore, under the Supreme Court’s
> precedents applying the First Amendment, the net neutrality
> rule violates the First Amendment.

The two [mentioned](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/520/180/) [rulings](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/622/) as far as I can tell relate to cable providers being required to air [locally licensed stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System,_Inc._v._FCC)

> Turner I established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In Turner II the court decided that the must carry provisions were constitutional.

I guess he is referencing the fact television companies were first amendment speakers but if he is saying the FCC cant apply the 1934 communication act because the internet is not ""radio"" how can he apply case law from the supreme court on a ruling about cable? If anything it would seem to me the internet is more analogous to radio than T.V.?
> Here, because Congress never passed net neutrality
> legislation, the FCC relied on the 1934 Communications Act,
> as amended in 1996, as its source of authority for the net
> neutrality rule. But that Act does not supply clear
> congressional authorization for the FCC to impose commoncarrier
> regulation on Internet service providers. Therefore,
> under the Supreme Court’s precedents applying the major
> rules doctrine, the net neutrality rule is unlawful.

Additionally based on the following text (mostly the editorial discretion part) I think he may be referencing [Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald_Publishing_Co._v._Tornillo) 
> In short, although the briefs and commentary about the
> net neutrality issue are voluminous, the legal analysis is
> straightforward: If the Supreme Court’s major rules doctrine
> means what it says, then the net neutrality rule is unlawful
> because Congress has not clearly authorized the FCC to issue
> this major rule. And if the Supreme Court’s Turner
> Broadcasting decisions mean what they say, then the net
> neutrality rule is unlawful because the rule impermissibly
> infringes on the Internet service providers’ **editorial
> discretion**

which ruled 

> Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case that overturned a Florida state law requiring newspapers to allow equal space in their newspapers to political candidates in the case of a political editorial or endorsement content. The court held that while the statute does not ""prevent [newspapers] from saying anything [they] wish"" it ""exacts a penalty on the basis of the content."" Because newspapers are economically finite enterprises, ""editors may conclude that the safe course is to avoid controversy,"" thereby chilling speech. Furthermore, the Court held the exercise of **editorial judgment** is a protected First Amendment activity. In effect, this ruling reaffirmed the constitutional principle of freedom of the press (detailed in the First Amendment) and prevented state governments from controlling the content of the press

Again why is a supreme court ruling on newspapers being applied as case law to the internet? Does that require some interpretation of the supreme courts intention that he seems to imply in his own dissent he cannot do?

> To state the obvious, the Supreme Court could
> always refine or reconsider the major rules doctrine or its
> decisions in the Turner Broadcasting cases. **But as a lower

Additionally does restricting internet access go both ways with free speech? If my ISP block reddit from me and I cannot participate in discussions on Reddit is that considered an impingement on free speech?"
What tax policy could fix tax havens?,"Most countries have a [territorial corporate tax system](https://taxfoundation.org/territorial-tax-system-oecd-review/) where multinational corporations are generally taxed as a proportion of the profits they make in each country. The United States is special in that it also claims [foreign income](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work) as taxable, but only when the profits are repatriated to the USA. This creates a stronger incentive to invest in foreign countries.

Large multinationals have developed convoluted structures to avoid paying taxes on foreign profits, like the well-publicized [Double Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement), where a set of nested sub-corporations across USA, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Bermuda pay royalties on intellectual property to each other. This allows the overall entity a legal means of avoiding a large amount of taxation.

One proposed measure in Europe is add a ~3% [gross revenue tax](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/threat-to-irish-tax-take-from-eu-proposal-to-levy-digital-giants-1.3426071) on tech companies (which are most able to cheaply move around intangible assets). This is much less manipulable, but a gross revenue tax kills low-margin businesses and arbitrarily incentivizes vertical integration.

Is there a corporate tax policy that could be uniformly adopted by all countries to disincentivize tax havens and bizarre corporate structures, while still ensuring that countries get a reasonable source of tax from activity that reasonably happens within their borders?"

[META] Seeking user feedback on insults directed at public figures,"We've had some internal discussions around this as a mod team, and want to get some user feedback around whether we should prohibit comments which contain insults/name calling directed at public figures.

In particular this came up around a comment calling Donald Trump a cheeto.  We had similar issues around a John Oliver related browser extension which replaced the word ""Trump"" with ""Drumpf.""

There are other public figures subject to namecalling too, and any policy would relate to other public figures equally.  Quantity wise though, people talk about the President of the United States far more than any other public figure.

One issue to consider is how to deal with insults directed at public figures which may be factually justified.  E.g. if one wants to call a political figure a liar based on sources showing that they're knowingly saying things which are not true, we wouldn't want to ban that.

Under our current rules, the general consensus has been that a comment which otherwise complies with the rules would not break a rule by using an insult directed at a public figure, but would if insulting another user.  A submission which used an insult against would violate the rule against neutral framing.

Should this policy change?  If so, what specific ideas for a new policy would you suggest?"
What are the advantages and disadvantages of constitutionalizing the US impeachment trial procedure?,"[The vote over not allowing witnesses and new evidence in the impeachment trial has dominated news cycles lately](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/31/us/politics/impeachment-vote.html). Are these elements of a trial that are so fundamental to the proceedings, that they should be accepted out of hand? (And/or there are other fundamental elements of a trial that were skipped that should also be deemed necessary?)

Did the framers leave [the process of the impeachment trial](https://constitutionus.com/#a1s2c5) too open-ended when they allowed for the possibility of the president being acquitted without witnesses or evidence? Are there advantages or intention behind the current vagueness of the procedures as outlined in the Constitution?

Should there be an amendment to the constitution that codifies this process and implements more standards, for example [more closely resembling criminal trial procedure](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part2/chapter223&edition=prelim)?

What are the potential downsides of this idea? EG: does this give the Chief Justice too much say in what witnesses and evidence gets allowed? Inconsistencies in going by criminal proceedings in a venue where there is no [well-defined criminal code](https://uscode.house.gov/browse/prelim@title18/part1&edition=prelim)? Are there ways to address these downsides or other ways an amendment could be framed? Should increased rigor on the Senate side raise the standards of impeachment on the House side?"
"What measures have been proposed, and what measures have been enacted to prevent foreign interference in the 2020 US presidential election?","The overwhelming consensus position of the US Government is that Russia attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election.

> **Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.**

> **We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.  Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.  We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.**  We have high confidence in these judgments.

> * **We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment.**  CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment;NSA has moderate confidence.

What do we know about the treatment of Hezbollah by the Obama administration near the time of the Iran deal?,"Politico reports that the DEA launched an investigation into Hezbollah in 2008, called Project Cassandra, and has evidence that Hezbollah is now a international crime syndicate that ""collects $1 billion a year from drug and weapons trafficking, money laundering and other criminal activities.""

[Politico reports that](https://www.politico.com/interactives/2017/obama-hezbollah-drug-trafficking-investigation/):

>When Project Cassandra leaders sought approval for some significant investigations, prosecutions, arrests and financial sanctions, officials at the Justice and Treasury departments delayed, hindered or rejected their requests.

>The Justice Department declined requests by Project Cassandra and other authorities to file criminal charges against major players such as Hezbollah’s high-profile envoy to Iran, a Lebanese bank that allegedly laundered billions in alleged drug profits, and a central player in a U.S.-based cell of the Iranian paramilitary Quds force. And the State Department rejected requests to lure high-value targets to countries where they could be arrested.

David Asher, a Defense Department illicit finance expert who worked on Project Cassandra, said about the decisions which hindered the project: 

>""This was a policy decision, it was a systematic decision. They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down.""

John Brennan, Obama's top counterterrorism adviser and then CIA director wrote that:

>“the next president has the opportunity to set a new course for relations between the two countries” through not only a direct dialogue, but “greater assimilation of Hezbollah into Lebanon’s political system.”

Why would Brennan want Hezbollah to have more political power?

In 2010, Reuters reported that at a conference in Washington, Brennan said:

>“Hezbollah is a very interesting organization,” Brennan told a Washington conference, citing its evolution from “purely a terrorist organization” to a militia to an organization that now has members within the parliament and the cabinet.

>“There is certainly the elements of Hezbollah that are truly a concern to us what they’re doing. And what we need to do is to find ways to diminish their influence within the organization and to try to build up the more moderate elements,” Brennan said.

Ali Fayad, A Lebanese arms dealer ""who had been indicted in U.S. courts on charges of planning the murders of U.S. government employees, attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization and attempting to acquire, transfer and use anti-aircraft missiles"" was arrested in Prague in 2014. He was in custody for 2 years, but

>top Obama administration officials declined to apply serious pressure on the Czech government to extradite him to the United States, even as Putin was lobbying aggressively against it.

>He is now believed by U.S. officials to be back in business, and helping to arm militants in Syria and elsewhere with Russian heavy weapons.

Katherine Bauer, a Treasury official under Obama, [testified in February 2017](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4329058-Katherine-Bauer-testimony-to-the-House-Committee.html) that

>“under the Obama administration … these [Hezbollah-related] investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.”

Politico adds to this by reporting:

>As a result, some Hezbollah operatives were not pursued via arrests, indictments, or Treasury designations that would have blocked their access to U.S. financial markets, according to Bauer, a career Treasury official, who served briefly in its Office of Terrorist Financing as a senior policy adviser for Iran before leaving in late 2015. And other “Hezbollah facilitators” arrested in France, Colombia, Lithuania have not been extradited — or indicted — in the U.S., she wrote.

David Asher said that

>“The closer we got to the [Iran deal], the more these activities went away. So much of the capability, whether it was special operations, whether it was law enforcement, whether it was [Treasury] designations — even the capacity, the personnel assigned to this mission — it was assiduously drained, almost to the last drop, by the end of the Obama administration.”

After the Iran deal was put into place,

>within months, task force officials said, Project Cassandra was all but dead. Some of its most senior officials, including Jack Kelly, the veteran DEA supervisory agent who created and led the task force, were transferred to other assignments. And Asher himself left the task force long before that, after the Defense Department said his contract would not be renewed.

>As a result, the U.S. government lost insight into not only drug trafficking and other criminal activity worldwide, but also into Hezbollah’s illicit conspiracies with top officials in the Iranian, Syrian, Venezuelan and Russian governments — all the way up to presidents Nicolas Maduro, Assad and Putin, according to former task force members and other current and former U.S. officials.

Derek Maltz, who oversaw Project Cassandra as the head of the DEA’s Special Operations Division for nine years, said:

>“Certainly there are targets that people feel that could have been indicted and weren’t. There is certainly an argument to be made that if tomorrow all the agencies were ordered to come together and sit in a room and put all the evidence on the table against all these bad guys, that there could be a hell of a lot of indictments.”

>“There’s no doubt in my mind now that the focus was this Iran deal and our initiative was kind of like a fly in the soup,”

Members of Congress are looking at appropriations control to seek accountability for Trump's alleged conduct in asking the Ukrainian government to investigate Joe Biden's family. Is using Congressional appropriations as leverage to investigate a political rival a formal legal issue?,"Democrats in the House and Senate, as well as some Republicans, are [pushing for accountability](https://www.apnews.com/e5607bb2be55436f824515b35539a97e) on Trump's [alleged behavior](https://www.apnews.com/94fdeaddc6b34c02b97278674b87541e) with Ukraine.

The specific area of concern is that President Trump used [appropriated Congressional spending](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ukraine/trump-administration-reinstates-military-aid-for-ukraine-idUSKCN1VX213) on foreign aid as leverage to get the newly elected leader of Ukraine to investigate Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his son (From Source 1):

> Democrats, and some Republicans, urged the White House to be forthcoming amid the reports that the president pressured Ukraine’s leader to help investigate political rival Joe Biden at the same time the administration was withholding $250 million in aid to the Eastern European nation.

[Furthermore](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/us/politics/trump-un-biden-ukraine.html): 

> Mr. Trump has acknowledged that he mentioned the Bidens in a call on July 25 with the new Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, and people familiar with the call have said Mr. Trump repeatedly urged Mr. Zelensky to speak with one of his personal lawyers, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been pushing Ukraine aggressively to look into the Bidens and the origins of material that implicated Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, in 2016.

---

I have a few of questions on this topic:

1. Do Presidential powers allow a President to dictate terms on appropriated Congressional aid to a foreign country? For example, suppose President Trump said Ukraine would not receive aid until they pledged to hold a public referendum on joining NATO. Can a President set such conditions on Congressional approved aid?

2. Specific to the ongoing Ukraine story with President Trump, are there any legal issues raised when a President asks a foreign nation to investigate US citizens? What about political opponents, other groups?

3. On question two, does adding the layer of withholding appropriated Congressional aid complicate that legal analysis?"

How realistic is Erogdans strategy in Syria and does it have sympathy or support from any other countries?,"Most of the media talks about the issue of incursion into Syria from the lens of US foreign policy. I'm trying to understand the motivations behind Turkeys strategy and what they hope to achieve. 

With /u/nosecohn 's help I found this article. 
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/turkey/2019-10-09/turkeys-endgame-syria

>>His solution, recently laid out in a speech at the UN General Assembly, is to carve out a large buffer zone along Syria’s border with Turkey. The area would be 300 miles long and 20 miles deep, under Turkish control, and off-limits to Kurdish forces. According to Erdogan, this “safe zone” would host two million to three million refugees, thus ridding Ankara of a major domestic headache. It would boast 200,000 homes, along with hospitals, football pitches, mosques, and schools, Turkish-built but financed internationally—a setup that would provide much-needed revenue for Turkey’s struggling construction sector at a time of economic downturn.

It sounds like there are three outcomes trying to be achieved.
1/ Relocation of refugees who are becoming a difficult problem for domestic politics
2/ Undermine the possibility of creation of a Kurdish state
3/ Provide economic stimulus to the domestic construction industry through construction projects funded by the international community (nobody has agreed to that but I guess they will try to bargain for it)

How realistic is this plan and does it have sympathy or support from any other countries?"
Are the former Attorney General's allegations against PM Trudeau criminal?,"Yesterday, former Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould [testified](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-testifies-justice-committee-1.5035219) that Prime Minister Trudeau and his staff had repeatedly pressured her to overturn the decision from the director of the Public Prosecution Service to prosecute the large Quebec-based engineering company SNC-Lavalin.

Ms. Wilson-Raybould was eventually moved to a different role in Cabinet (Veterans Affairs), and subsequently resigned from Cabinet earlier this month.

Following her testimony, leader of the opposition and Conservative party leader Andrew Scheer [called for Trudeau to resign and for the RCMP to launch a criminal probe.](https://globalnews.ca/news/5007650/andrew-scheer-justin-trudeau-snc-lavalin-resign/)

1. If true, do the allegations made by Ms. Wilson-Raybould against the Prime Minister constitute a crime, as implied by Mr. Scheer's call for a police investigation?

2. What forms of public inquiry, as suggested by Mr. Singh, would be available? Would a [royal commission](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/royal-commissions) be historically or structurally appropriate for a discrete issue like this?"

Sean Spicer commented that [""The rule simply made it too easy for trial lawyers to go after American companies and American workers who contract with the federal government""](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/27/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer-3272017-29).

Additionally, 66% of federally employed contractors had more than 1 wage violation in the past 3 years. 

My questions are:

1) Do the cons of this EO outweigh the pros? (obviously this administration thinks so, what does NP think?)

2) Is there a way to institute this regulation to protect workers while also not putting unjust burden on companies?

"John Bolton, North Korea, and the Trump White House's Successes and Failures","[In an exclusive interview](https://www.axios.com/bolton-john-trump-north-korea-missiles-94088bf9-4d2d-4d10-bfd9-80db7bc36a50.html), former U.S. National Security  Advisor John Bolton told Axios that the Trump Administration should admit its approach to end North Korea’s nuclear arms program has “failed.” Bolton suggested the Trump administration is ""bluffing"" about stopping North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and it would be “very unusual” for this White House to say that they were wrong.

John Bolton, though, is an interesting figure himself to say the least. Bloomberg, [in their piece on how Bolton's departure could impact the President's foreign policy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/john-bolton-trump-foreign-policy), described Bolton as ""the most vocal hardliner [in] President Donald Trump's inner circle."" Bolton's departure has also been met by favorable and affirmative statements from other government, [including that of North Korea](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-20/north-korea-praises-trump-for-ousting-troublemaker-bolton). Foreign Policy magazine went so far as to [analogize](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/01/john-bolton-is-ready-to-go-rogue/) the Trump-Bolton relationship with the tumultuous Reagan-Haig relationship of the 1980s. If that were the case, I'd imagine Mr. Bolton would love to criticize Mr. Trump regardless of how effectively the White House operates.

That being said, Kim Jong Un has been presenting himself to be very tough recently. Earlier this month [he inspected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/kim-jong-un-is-back-on-his-white-horse-as-north-korea-flags-a-big-decision/2019/12/03/7bbc9b2a-163c-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) ""revolutionary battle sites"" around Mount Paektu, and [warned Washington](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-warns-united-states-of-an-unwelcome-christmas-gift/2019/12/03/ad406634-1599-11ea-80d6-d0ca7007273f_story.html) that it could soon receive an ""unwelcome Christmas gift,"" calling us all back to remember [the last thing](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/05/asia/north-korea-missile-nuclear-gift/index.html) North Korea described as a ""gift."" I'm no deterrence theorist, but that seems a bit like bolstering reputation and interest.

So, what are we supposed to believe. Is John Bolton right in saying the Trump White House is failing in North Korea, or is John Bolton merely criticizing an ex-employer? More specifically, could you give me any insights on: 

 - **What successes (and failures) has the Trump Administration seen in its relations with North Korea;**
 - **Are those successes (and failures) significant compared to the successes of other Presidencies;**
 - **Can those successes be maintained (or those failures undone) by this Administration, or are they fleeting, and;** 
 - **Is it reasonable to believe that another specific strategy is definitively more likely to bring about more success (or less failure)?**

[Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush both used blind trusts, while President Obama used a mixture of index funds, treasury notes, and college savings accounts. While Trump's assets have been perceived as not being transferable to a blind trust due to their expansiveness, it has been suggested that a general trust could have been created to manage his businesses and significantly reduce the appearance of a conflict of interest.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferwang/2016/11/15/why-trump-wont-use-a-blind-trust-and-what-his-predecessors-did-with-their-assets/#57ff157729c0)

"Is there evidence that allowing state actors to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to protected classes promote equal opportunity?

> The California Constitution, pursuant to provisions enacted by the initiative Proposition 209 in 1996, prohibits the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting. The California Constitution defines the state for these purposes to include the state, any city, county, public university system, community college district, school district, special district, or any other political subdivision or governmental instrumentality of, or within, the state.

> This measure would repeal these provisions. The measure would also make a statement of legislative findings in this regard.

> WHEREAS, Equal opportunity is deeply rooted in the American ideals of fairness, justice, and equality. Programs to meet the goals of equal opportunity seek to realize these basic values. Equal opportunity not only helps individuals, but also helps communities in need and benefits our larger society. California’s equal opportunity program was upended by the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996...

Is there evidence that allowing state actors to discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to protected classes promote equal opportunity? If so, what is the evidence and how would that work?

* Foreign nations

2. Are both, Foreign and Local entities, paid? Or just the Foreign ones?

3. In case no one is getting paid, will this lead to a crisis, or will the world just be like ""It's the US, they'll just pay up when this resolved."""
Denaturalization in the United States,"**TLDR: How have we gotten from Justice Black's rejection of ""fleeting citizenship"" to the current set of laws being enforced by the USCIS?** 

[The USCIS has started a denaturalization task force](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/uscis-starting-denaturalization-task-force/) with the intent of finding ""U.S. citizens they say should not have been naturalized, to revoke their citizenship, and then eventually deport them.""

As I understand it, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but [*Trop v. Dulles,* 356 U.S. 86 (1958)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1956/70), has yet to be overturned. Within the case, section 401(g) of the amended 1940 Nationality Act (which authorized the expatriation of Albert L. Trop after he was convicted for desertion during wartime) was found unconstitutional on 8th Amendment grounds, thus implying that a person can't have their citizenship revoked from them as punishment for a crime.

Earlier in that year though [*Perez v. Brownell*, 356 US 44 (1958)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1957/44) affirmed that Congress did have the right to revoke a native-born American of their citizenship, especially given the circumstances of the case (as Clemente Perez didn't abide by the Selective Service laws in place during WWII, and also spent much of his life in his ancestral home of Mexico, even voting in Mexican elections).

However, 9 years later in [*Afroyim v. Rusk*, 387 U.S. 253 (1967)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1966/456), which has yet to be overturned, the Court reversed *Perez* in a 6-4 opinion, where Justice Hugo Black, writing for the majority, said the following: 

>All persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of the United States...."" There is no indication in these words of a fleeting citizenship, good at the moment it is acquired but subject to destruction by the Government at any time. Rather the Amendment can most reasonably be read as defining a citizenship which a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it. Once acquired, this Fourteenth Amendment citizenship was not to be shifted, canceled, or diluted at the will of the Federal Government, the States, or any other governmental unit.

HOWEVER, despite all of this, the USCIS states on [their official website](https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartL-Chapter2.html), that a person can be stripped of their citizenship if a person either ""Procures Naturalization Illegally"", during the naturalization process ""misrepresents or conceals some fact ... willfully"", ""becomes a member of, or affiliated with, the Communist party, other totalitarian party, or terrorist organization within five years of his or her naturalization"", or dissociates from the US Military for any reason ""other than Honorable Discharge before Five Years of Honorable Service after Naturalization"" (if that person had naturalized on the basis of honorable service to the US armed forces).

There are a few links on the website, but it's 2 AM and I won't lie, I'm really struggling to understand the disconnect between the law and these court cases. If anybody could please tell me what's going on here I'd really appreciate it. Were any of these court cases overturned? Was no case overturned fully, but was Justice Black's interpretation of the 14th Amendment severely diminished by another legal rule put forward by a future case? Are lower court judges refusing to uphold these cases?

Thanks for your time."
How do US laws regarding free speech differ from those in the rest of the world?,"Compared with the rest of the world, [people in the US are generally more accepting of free speech.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/18/where-the-world-sees-limits-to-free-speech/) But from a legal standpoint, is the US really an outlier?

Harvard's Fredrick Schauer [believes so:](https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=9NKaXYtw9YUC&pg=PA652&lpg=PA652#v=onepage&q&f=false)

> …the American First Amendment, as authoritatively interpreted, remains a recalcitrant outlier to a growing international understanding of what freedom of expression entails.

And Section II of [this paper](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+First+Amendment+in+Cross-Cultural+Perspective%3A+A+Comparative...-a0178535684) (PDF) finds considerable discrepancies between the legal foundations of free speech in the US and that of four other modern democracies (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom).

On the other hand, Article 19 of the United Nations' [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/) attempts to set a common standard:

> Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

So, is there an international legal consensus on how to define freedom of speech? In general, are there legal commonalities we see in other countries that value this freedom? Is the US legal view an outlier, and if so, in what ways?"

1: Can militia groups detain immigrants on the Southern border?

Is Herman Cain qualified to sit on the Federal Reserve Board?,"Yesterday, President Trump [nominated](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/437467-trump-says-he-will-nominate-herman-cain-to-fed-board) [Herman Cain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Cain) to fill one of the vacant seats on the [Federal Reserve Board,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Board_of_Governors) which oversees the central banking system of the United States. 


Cain was formerly a presidential candidate, CEO of Godfather's Pizza, and CEO of the National Restaurant Association.

[Some have argued](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/trump-herman-cain-federal-reserve-gold-standard.html) that he's unqualified for the position and his nomination [""puts the institution at risk.""](https://www.ft.com/content/b818fd1e-5730-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1) 

However, during a four-year period in the 1990s, Cain was a member and then chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, so despite not being an economist, he does have high-level experience in this organization. 

Does that make him qualified?

"The Senate generally has the right to decide for itself what to hold votes on, however there are some exceptions, such as a Joint Resolution to overturn a State of Emergency that has already passed in the House. Is the Senate required to hold a vote on overriding a Presidential veto?","The House of Representatives is [considering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pelosi-warns-trump-republicans-against-emergency-declaration-on-border-funding/2019/02/14/cf6f492c-3099-11e9-86ab-5d02109aeb01_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8da90ff1ccbb) a Joint Resolution to overturn President Trump's Emergency Declaration to build a wall on the Southern border. If passed in the House, a vote on the Joint Resolution will be [forced in the Senate](https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-authorities-president-trump-using-build-border-wall):

> The National Emergencies Act (NEA) establishes certain expedited procedures that Congress may use to terminate a declaration of national emergency, which are set forth at 50 U.S.C. § 1622(c). When a joint resolution terminating a national emergency is introduced in either chamber, it is referred to an appropriate committee, which is obligated to report it out with any recommendations within 15 calendar days. The House or Senate is then obligated to vote on the proposal within three calendar days. If one chamber passes a resolution, it is then passed to the other chamber, where the same basic procedures apply. If the two chambers pass different versions of a joint resolution, then a conference committee is obligated to file a compromise report within six days, which then must be voted on within an additional six days. If they cannot come to agreement, they must report that back within 48 hours. **The net effect of these procedures is to ensure that joint resolutions to terminate national emergencies will receive at least some manner of vote (procedural or substantive) in both chambers, regardless of the preferences of House or Senate leadership or any filibusters by Senate members.**

From there, President Trump will have the option to Veto the resolution, which would send it back to the House and Senate where 2/3 majorities in both chambers will be required to overrule Trump's veto (from 2nd source):

> ...a joint resolution ending a national emergency is still subject to a veto by the president.

> ...a presidential veto of a joint resolution can be overridden only by two-thirds of both chambers of Congress.

A Joint Resolution to overturn a Presidential Emergency Declaration is an exception to the general rules.

The two *typical* ways a [vote is brought to the Senate are](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RS20668.pdf) (PDF warning):

> (1) The Senate, at the majority leader’s request, grants unanimous consent to take up a matter.

>  (2) it agrees to his motion to proceed to consider it. Because the motion to proceed is subject to debate in most circumstances, it is less frequently used.

----

This leaves me very confused about what rules dictate a forced vote in the Senate when the President vetos a Joint Resolution to overturn an Emergency Declaration. For example, if a Joint Resolution passes in the House and Senate, the President vetos that JR, does the Senate *have* to vote on overruling that veto?

I have two questions:

1: Does the Senate *have* to hold votes on overturning a Presidential veto? Is there anything different about a Joint Resolution to overturn a Presidential Emergency Declaration that would force a vote on overturning *that* Presidential veto?

2: If there is a dispute as to whether or not the chamber is forced to vote, how is that conflict resolved? 

---

**Edit: If I could add this question:**

**This Joint Resolution, should it be passed in the House, seems like a fairly unique procedure to force a Senate floor vote. Are there any other odd procedures relating to any topic that would force a Senate floor vote like this?**

What are the First Amendment implications now that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has stated that players will be benched if they do not stand for the national anthem?,"This Sunday, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated that any player that disrespects the flag, will not play.  While, undoubtedly NFL teams have the right to dictate player behavior on (and off) the field, this right seems to have been complicated by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence's actions and words. 

http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20961541/dallas-cowboys-owner-jerry-jones-says-player-disrespects-flag-play

There is evidence that President Trump is attempting to influence/encourage/suggest a change in NFL policy, per twitter @realDonaldTrump:

>Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/912080538755846144?lang=en

>If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!

https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/911904261553950720?lang=en

This week Vice President Mike Pence publicly left an NFL football game after members of the 49ers kneeled during the national anthem.  This would appear to be a direct escalation and encouragement of Trump's above tweet encouraging a public boycott.  

http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/08/vice-president-mike-pence-leaves-colts-49ers-game-after-players-reportedly-kneel.html

There are also reports that President Trump called Jerry Jones 4 times the previous week, urging the owner 'not to allow his players to kneel' during the national anthem. 

http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/353362-trump-called-cowboys-jerry-jones-four-times-asking-him-not-to-kneel 

 So, supposing a Cowboy player is punished next week for failing to express 'adequate' respect for the flag, what are the legal implications in terms of First Amendment rights?  Can we trace a clear path from the President's words to a private citizen's punishment?  At what point does pressure (on the part of the federal government through Trump's public advocacy) reach coercion?  Has public federal advocacy here exposed NFL owners to potential liability if they follow through?  Are the Cowboys uniquely exposed due to President Trump's personal involvement?"
Is PRISM still in any way effective now that it is public?,Won't the people conducting illicit activity now know to keep their activities off of the observed networks and methods of communication? What's the point anymore?

As of Friday, he was either + 1 or 2 in each of those polls but every other poll has him down btwn 5-8 ish points. I don't understand how the discrepancy here is so big.

What are the real risks of Artificial Intelligence? Are there government responses to those risks and what are they?,"Elon Musk has [gone on the record](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x) with his concerns regarding AI. To whit,  he has discussed his [Mars colonization](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/elon-musk-publishes-plans-for-colonizing-mars/) ambitions as [part-and-parcel](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/elon-musk-colonize-mars/) with his somewhat cataclysmic view of how AI will manifest itself in the future:

>Musk’s alarming views on the dangers of A.I. first went viral after he spoke at M.I.T. in 2014—speculating (pre-Trump) that A.I. was probably humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” He added that he was increasingly inclined to think there should be some national or international regulatory oversight—anathema to Silicon Valley—“to make sure that we don’t do something very foolish.” He went on: “With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon. You know all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he’s like, yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon? Doesn’t work out.” Some A.I. engineers found Musk’s theatricality so absurdly amusing that they began echoing it. When they would return to the lab after a break, they’d say, “O.K., let’s get back to work summoning.”

I'd like to set [parameters](http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/Teachers/riskuncertainty.html) for this conversation by distinguishing between *risk* and *uncertainty*:

>**[Risk]** is present when future events occur with measurable probability
>
>**[Uncertainty]** is present when the likelihood of future events is indefinite or incalculable

I'm doing this because, while I appreciate the possibility that machines could learn to do bad things or have unintended consequences, I'd like to stay away from the realm of Killer Robot Santa unless we have a data set to extrapolate there.

Bearing this framework in mind:

1. What risks does AI pose to humanity, whether our well-being or more pedestrian issues like job transformations and mechanical snafus?

2. What data do we have to determine these are risks and not simply uncertainties?

3. How can we use this data to consider if government responses (e.g., regulation, investment, criminalization) to these risks are appropriate, and what might those solutions be?"

**5:42 PM EST** Welcome to the 2018 /r/NeutralPolitics election night megathread!  I'll be keeping a running tick tock below as the night goes on.  If you know of helpful resources I can add above please share in the comments and I'll try to integrate them. 

**6:01 PM EST** First polls have closed in eastern KY and most of Indiana.  KY-06 is an interesting race to watch, [rated as a toss up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/6/) by forecasters.  

**6:21 PM EST** Posted a new thread because of an issue with the title of the old thread.  Sorry about the error.

**6:33PM EST** First called race of the night is KY-05 for Republican Harold Rogers.  No surprise there as [he was forecast to win by 50.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/5/)

**7:00 PM EST**  Big poll closing, GA, SC, VA, VT, NH, and most of FL closed.  Remainders of KY and IN closed.  Networks calling **VT** and **VA** Senate for Democrats.

**7:25 PM EST** Lot of votes coming in now.  Looking decently good for Democrats.  McGrath in KY-06 up by 6 with over 40% reporting.  FL-Sen and FL-Gov looking pretty close to 2012 results for Obama (who won FL).

**7:30 PM EST**  Ohio and West Virginia close, no calls.

**7:38 PM EST** First flip of the night, **VA-10** has flipped to democrats.

**7:55 PM EST** OH-Sen has been called for Sherrod Brown (D).  I am still trying to get a handle on IN-Sen, but it seems like a probable R pickup at the moment. But no votes from Bloomington and minimal from Indianapolis, so no calls yet.

**8:00 PM EST** Big poll closing, calls in MA-Sen, CT-Sen, DE-Sen, MD-Sen, PA-Sen RI-Sen all for democrats.  No calls in TN, NJ, ME.  MA-Gov for Baker (R).

**8:22 PM EST** 538's live model now has Republicans favored to take the House.

**8:46 PM EST** 538 [has now changed their model to be less aggressive.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059982719554215936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Also first toss up call of KY-06 has gone to Barr (R)

**8:47 PM EST** ABC has projected Braun (R) to unseat Joe Donnelly in IN-Sen.

**8:59 PM EST** Manchin (WV-Sen) has held his seat.

**9:00 PM EST** Poll closings in a bunch more states.  No call in TX-Sen, TX gov for Abbot.  NY-Gov for Dems, NY-Sen for Dems, No call in AZ-Sen, ND sen no call, MN-Sen (Klobuchar) elected. WI-Sen Dem, WY-Sen R, 

**9:03 PM EST** Networks calling **TN-Sen** for Blackburn (R).  There does not seem to be any path for Democrats to take the Senate.

**9:44 PM EST** Texas Senate is surprisingly close given the overall national environment.  Lot of house races to be called but a lot of small dem leads in them that might give it to the dems.

**9:51 PM EST** NYT has their needle working finally and it is saying dems will win the House (and Beto will lose)

**10:00 PM EST** Polls closing in more states.  Romney wins UT-Sen.  Kobach called loser in KS-Gov to flip that to democrats.

**10:06 PM EST** After some initial freakout for Democrats, looking more like the middle range of the night we expected.  Biggest surprise so far is Donnovan in NY-11 (Staten Island) being ousted.  Very curious to see if that extends to the other NY metro area seats in contention (NY-1 and NY-2 on LI, where there are no results in yet).

**10:16 PM EST** Texas, and with it the Senate, have been called for Republicans, looks like Republicans will pick up 2 to 4 seats in the Senate.

**10:21 PM EST** Networks calling the House for democrats.

**10:42 PM EST** Little downballot news, FL amendment 4 has passed, restoring voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have a felony conviction.  May be a big deal for future FL elections.

**10:55 PM EST** Looks like [Democrats will get a trifecta in New York State.](https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1060017122338844672)

**11:00 PM EST** More poll closings on the west coast.  Everything in the lower 48 is in (apart from people still in line to vote).  Lots more counting to do, but the headline for the night is known.

**11:13 PM EST** NYT projection now has FL-Sen at a 0.0 gap between the candidates.  Who likes Florida recounts?

**11:45 PM EST** Biggest upset of the night so far is in OK-05 where Democrat Kendra Horn has unseated Steve Russell in [a seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%27s_5th_congressional_district) Trump won by 13, and Romney won by 18.

**11:48 PM EST** MO-Sen called for Republicans.  Their 3rd pickup of the night.

**11:49 PM EST** Anyone know why there's no results in Nevada yet?  Polls closed almost 2 hours ago.

**11:55 PM EST** More downballot news, Michigan [has passed a major election reform measure allowing same day registration and no excuse absentee voting.](https://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/1060026162276122627)

**12:04 AM EST** Looks like Democrats will [break GOP supermajority in NC's House, and are leading but not called in enough to do so in the Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-carolina-elections.html) which had led to a lot of [veto overrides.](http://www.wbtv.com/story/38812360/nc-legislature-makes-quick-work-with-veto-overrides/)

**12:20 AM EST** ME-2 has both candidates under 50%, so it looks like this may be the first [usage of Maine's new ranked choice voting scheme.](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/politics/how-maine-is-handling-its-first-general-election-with-ranked-choice-voting/)

**12:24 AM EST** Finally got an answer as to why no results in Nevada, apparently no results are released until all votes are cast, and some people [have been in very long lines in the Reno area.](https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1060039493745487873)

**12:32 AM EST** [Utah and Idaho have approved Medicaid expansion referenda.](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1060041180287787008)   Also looks like a close race in CT-Gov.

**12:48 AM EST** Since we have the headline results baked in, I am going to end the tick tock here.  There are a number of races still to be resolved, but we know who will control the houses of Congress."
How do the campaign finance violations to which Michael Cohen pleaded guilty today compare to violations by past campaigns?,"[Today, Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney entered a guilty plea related to tax and campaign finance charges.  As the New York Times describes:](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur)

>Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer, made the extraordinary admission in court on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.

>Mr. Cohen acknowledged the illegal payments while pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges. He told a judge in United States District Court in Manhattan that the payments to the women were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.”



I was wondering how this compares to past campaign finance issues Presidents and candidates have had.  In particular, I found [this article](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/obama-2008-campaign-fined-375000-085784) and [this article](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/07/obama-campaign-fined-big-for-hiding-donors-keeping-illegal-donations) about excess donations to the Obama campaign in 2012, and wanted to know what was similar or different about that case, or other past cases like this?

"How are ""Basic Human Rights"" defined legally? What items currently fall under that category, and why?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_United_States

What items are included in Basic Human Rights and what's the basis for including them?

For example, [Elizabeth Warren promotes health care as a basic human right](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/27/warren-made-fateful-choice/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.75c54effb748). Conversely, [Rand Paul speaks against that idea](https://www.politico.com/story/2011/05/paul-right-to-health-care-is-slavery-054769), as that would fall under slavery by forcing doctors/nurses/staff to provide their services and labor. This is just one example. 

I really want to pin down the meaning of ""Basic Human Rights"". I'm posting this in a few different subreddits to get different viewpoints. 

1. What does ""Basic Human Rights"" mean?
2. What are some items that fall under ""Basic Human Rights"", from a legal standpoint in the U.S.?

What evidence exists to support the claim that the long-term benefit of repatriation of American manufacturing outweighs the immediate higher costs and will spur higher growth?,"Yesterday Peter Navarro (the White House Trade Council director) [was on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/19/538148732/white-house-trade-council-director-touts-made-in-america-week), making an argument for the repatriation of American manufacturing.  I'm going to take this point by point here:

>NAVARRO: Well, I think you start with the idea that we've had 15 years of subpar growth - 2 percent or below. Prior to 2001, we grew at 3 and a half percent. The big difference has been the entry of China in particular into the World Trade Organization and our markets. And we've just been hammered. What that does as a proxy basically is it drains essentially the lifeblood out of our manufacturing economy, out of our communities, out of our tax bases.

The first part of this statement [may be an exaggeration](https://www.thebalance.com/us-gdp-by-year-3305543), but [one study](https://seii.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/china-paper.pdf) suggests that:

>Conservatively, it [rising Chinese import competition] explains one-quarter of the contemporaneous aggregate decline in U.S. manufacturing employment. Transfer benefits payments for unemployment, disability, retirement, and healthcare also rise sharply in exposed labor markets.

However, [other economists dispute](https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21718513-china-shock-has-not-been-debunked-it-worth-understanding) at least some of these claims, arguing that studying the effects of extra Chinese supply  in isolation rather than in conjunction with something happening in America over-inflates the purported effect on the labor market.  Still [others argue](http://www.nber.org/papers/w19376.pdf) that the net welfare benefit to the US of stopping free trade with China would roughly be equal to the benefit gained by cheaper Chinese imports.

**Is the US-Chinese Trade deficit a significant factor in the decline of American manufacturing & growth?  Is it balanced by the benefit of cheaper imported goods for consumers?**

Navarro further goes on to assert that:

>What's interesting is that with every different country that we have a large trade deficit with, we have a different set of problems - with Mexico, for example - cheap labor. With Germany, they have a misaligned currency. So if you address these issues of unfair trade practices, if you get better trade deals, if you stop things like forced technology transfer or the theft of our intellectual property, if you ensure that the sweatshops of the world live up to international standards for minimum wage and safe working conditions, if you have reasonable environmental protection, then American manufacturers can compete with anybody in the world.

This is a very broad set of issues.  Focusing on worker compensation, the [Fair Labor Association states](http://www.fairlabor.org/sites/default/files/documents/reports/toward_fair_compensation_in_global_supply_chains_2016_report_only_0.pdf) reports that even when there are no legal violations in pay for workers in third world countries, the ""purchasing power of the current legal [wage] minimum falls below or near the World Bank poverty line"".  Additionally, the US has several trade agreements with [legally enforceable environmental protections](https://www.state.gov/e/oes/eqt/trade/).  My question here is:

**What measures currently exist to correct inequalities (wages/labor, environmental, intellectual property, etc.) between US manufacturers and those abroad and are they enforceable?**

Further, **what further protections would be necessary to enable ""American manufacturers to compete with anybody in the world""?**

Finally, Navarro argues:

>NAVARRO: Let me give you a number of answers to that. I mean first of all, a lot of the goods that come from abroad which are, quote, ""cheaper"" basically are cheaper because state-owned enterprises have made them heavily subsidized by their government, and they're dumped into our markets. Number two, if you look at this as a movie rather than a snapshot and you buy American in our government procurement policy - let's say it costs a little bit more - but what do you get for that?
...
What I'm saying is that if something looks like it costs a little more just 'cause it's made in America, when you cost it all out the benefits over time far outweigh the costs. Think about this. Over the last 15 years what has been the cost of buying all those cheap goods? We've lost trillions in terms of our tax base, and we put millions of people out of work.

The [Harvard business review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/how-chinese-subsidies-changed) supports the first part of Navarro's statement:

>In the Chinese industries we studied — solar, steel, glass, paper, and auto parts — labor was between 2% and 7% of production costs, and imported raw materials and energy accounted for most costs. Production mostly came from small companies that possessed no scale economies. Yet, Chinese products routinely sold for 25% to 30% less than those from the U.S. or European Union.

>We found that Chinese companies could do this only because of subsidies they received from China’s central and provincial governments. The subsidies took the form of free or low-cost loans; artificially cheap raw materials, components, energy, and land; and support for R&D and technology acquisitions.

>Since 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization, subsidies have annually financed over 20% of the expansion of the country’s manufacturing capacity. The state has willingly paid the price of economic inefficiency to accomplish political, social, economic, and diplomatic goals. Huge Chinese subsidies have led to massive excess global capacity, increased exports, and depressed worldwide prices, and have hollowed out other countries’ industrial bases.

as does the [American Enterprise Institute](http://www.aei.org/publication/the-importance-of-chinese-subsidies/), but further states:

>The harm is usually identified as large-scale U.S. imports from China. In fact, the main problems are barriers to American exports to the PRC and, perhaps soon, a growing battle in third markets. For the last decade, Beijing has acted as if competition is good for everyone except Chinese firms on their home turf.

**Does the current evidence suggest that imports of subsidized foreign goods are laregly responsible for slowing American growth, or is the problem instead barriers to American exports (or both/neither)?**

**Would the benefits of policies to protect American manufacturing indeed outweigh the increased costs of goods?**"

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective), no incumbent lost their primary in any of these three states. 47 districts/seats in total were up for grabs.

By my count, no Democratic candidate filed to run in 13 districts, and no Republican filed to run in 4 districts.

In addition, in 21 districts only one Democrat was on the ballot (uncontested), and in 19 districts only one Republican was on the ballot (uncontested). By the other way of looking at it, there were competitive primary races in only 13 Democratic districts (28%), and 24 Republican Districts (51%).

Come November, seven districts will be entirely uncontested because only one candidate will be on the general election ballot (three districts had candidates who waltz into the House with no opposition at any point whatsoever).

"Help me understand current immigration law regarding ""chain migration""","After reading [a few](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/07/576301232/explaining-chain-migration) [sources](https://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-does-immigration-sponsorship-work/) my current understanding of ""chain migration"" is that permanent immigrants need a sponsor with either a green card or citizenship before they are granted permanent residence. When/if that new immigrant gets their green card, they can then sponsor someone else. 

In any single step, **only** parents, children, spouses and siblings of the green card holder can be sponsored, right?

So then the ""chain"" term comes in when I sponsor my brother, who then sponsors his wife, who sponsors her mom, who sponsors her 5 kids, who then sponsor their 3 siblings each...so my one sponsorship could potentially lead to the sponsorship of people with no relation to me.

Does all that conform to the current law as I've described it? And after that, what does the current administration want to change it to?

Has Israel exposed nuclear deal violations by Iran?,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently [gave a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qBt4tSCALA) where he made many accusations against Iran.

What Would Need to Happen For the US to Become a Multi-Party State?,"I was wondering if America could ever adopt a multi-party system like the rest of the modern democracies in the world.

Bernie Sanders overwhelmingly won the youth vote in the democratic primary.

A logical explanation could be that younger Americans sympathise more with his social-democratic leanings. But older Americans, who can still remember the Cold War, may see his policies as too socialist. If this is true, then in 10 or 20 years a candidate with similar ideologies to Sanders may have an even better chance in a presidential race.

...OR in a few decades will the current youth voters become less willing to elect such a candidate? Will they oppose change more as they age?

Does it matter in an obstruction of justice case whether or not President Donald Trump actually succeeded in firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller?,"According to this [New York Times 'bombshell' report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/us/politics/trump-mueller-special-counsel-russia.html), Trump ordered the firing of Robert Mueller. It states that the only reason Robert Mueller and his investigation exist still is because Trump's White House Counsel refused to carry out Trump's order. Trump then backed off when the White House Counsel threatened to quit in response.

On Fox News, and specifically [Fox and Friends this morning](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/26/trump-slams-report-claiming-sought-to-fire-mueller-blames-fake-news.html), some hosts have argued that this act does not matter because Trump didn't end up firing Mueller in the end, so the report is a non-starter. It would only have been obstruction had the order been followed to completion. 

Other pro-Trump arguments [(same Fox News article with quote at 1:45 in video)](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/26/trump-slams-report-claiming-sought-to-fire-mueller-blames-fake-news.html) include that Trump backed off of the firing after being given proper guidance by his Counsel -- albeit guidance in the form of a threat. But nonetheless, Trump let the investigation continue once he was given more information regarding the matter.

My question, in the title, is something that is being hotly debated on every single news channel and in every debate circle. Does obstruction of justice need the actual act carried out to completion? Is the case of obstruction of justice less weighty considering the fact that Trump didn't pursue the firing after White House Counsel threatened to resign? Does Trump now have a better case *against* obstruction of justice seeing as he changed his mind on firing Mueller and let it continue unobstructed?"

I appreciate that there are many factors at play when it comes to health care, such as the number of people insured and the premiums, which are of course important, but it surprises me that there is almost no discussion about the effect on the deficit. Is reducing the deficit over 10 years an important benefit of this legislation? Are the CBO's claims that it will be substantially reduced accurate?"
Is there precedent for the House Judiciary procedures in questioning Attorney General Barr,"[AG Barr was supposed to testify today, but refused to submit to the democrats request to allow staff counsel to question him.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-democrats-prepare-hearing-attorney-general-barr/story?id=62758055)

What are some examples of having congressional staff and/or their lawyers question a person called to testify during an oversight committee hearing?

In what ways, if any, does having congressional staff (as opposed to elected congresspeople) question a person differ from historical norms?

What legal, political, or historical basis is there for allowing congressional staff to question a person called to testify before a congressional committee?"
Was there anything unusual about the cause or timing of Andrew McCabe's firing from the FBI?,"On March 16, former Deputy Director of the FBI, [Andrew McCabe,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCabe) was [fired just 26 hours before his scheduled retirement,](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-mccabe-fired-20180316-story.html) after nearly 22 years at the FBI. The last-minute dismissal [reduced and/or delayed some of McCabe's benefits under his government pension.](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/16/politics/andrew-mccabe-pension-if-fired/index.html) 

The firing resulted from a [report](https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/041318_McCabe-Report.pdf) by the Department of Justice’s inspector general that was just released to the public today. It [sharply criticizes McCabe](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/13/fbi-mccabe-fired-inspector-general-report-522580) for unauthorized disclosures to the media ahead of the 2016 election and lacking candor with investigators.

For his part, McCabe, a long time Republican, [believes he was targeted and eventually fired because of the work he did on the Russia probe,](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/16/17132418/andrew-mccabe-statement) and as part of a larger effort by the president and his supporters to discredit the FBI.

My questions are about the norms of firing for cause at the Federal level:

* The IG's report outlines four incidents of violation of FBI policy, but doesn't recommend what should be done with McCabe. Was his firing for lack of candor within established norms, even considering his long history with the bureau?
* McCabe had resigned his post months before the firing and was on paid leave at the time, so he wasn't working at the FBI, but the President had previously [urged the Attorney General to fire him](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/us/politics/jeff-sessions-trump-mccabe.html) multiple times. Is it unusual for a President to recommend the AG fire a specific person at the FBI, even one who is not currently working at the bureau?
* Is it common that the IG would provide the report to the Attorney General so far in advance of providing it to Congress and the public? Is there evidence that the report was rushed to the powers that be in order to beat the clock on McCabe's pending retirement?
* Overall, even if the firing was justified, is there evidence to suggest it was done in a vindictive manner, or can such suggestions be chalked up to coincidence?"
"Given the United States' for-profit healthcare system, how can Trump keep coverage for pre-existing conditions while still allowing insurance companies to profit?","Trump reported during his [60 Minutes interview](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-open-to-amending-obamacare-affordable-care-act/) that he would want to keep coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.

I've attempted to search the internet for more specific policy points, but I've found little. By what method could a Republican health care plan cover pre-existing conditions without a mandate while keeping insurance companies profitable?

Off Year Election Night Megathread,"So it is election day for most (all?) of the US today.  As is election tradition we shall be doing a megathread here.

Outside those states, there is a very interesting DA's race [in Philadelphia](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphians-prepare-select-new-district-attorney/) where the Democratic candidate is running on a very strongly anti-mass-incarceration platform.  There's also a referendum on holding a [New York Constitutional Convention](https://ballotpedia.org/New_York_Proposal_1,_Constitutional_Convention_Question_(2017\)) and a referendum in Maine on [expanding Medicaid, which the legislature tried to do but which was vetoed by Gov.

**7:10 PM EST**  Polls closed in VA about 10 min ago, though no results yet.  [Exit poll says Northam by 5](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=19559644#livepress-update-19559644) for what that's worth.

**7:24 PM EST** Something appears to be badly wrong with the NYT results page and it is displaying numbers which quite literally don't add up.  [Try the Washington Post's instead.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/2017-election-results/virginia/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-high_va-results-button%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.222d69bd0f2d)

**7:30 PM EST** NYT seems to have sorted out their bug.

**7:35 PM EST**  Lots of results coming in VA now.  Northam seems to be doing better than the rest of the Democratic ticket there, and is performing very strongly where he needs to.  Looks like Northam is going to win it, but the other races for Lt Gov and AG may be closer.

**7:54 PM EST** NYT estimator has Northam at +8 median outcome and Gillespie well outside the cone of probability.  I expect we'll be seeing networks call it soon.  And if Northam does pull a +8 victory, he should be accompanied by the rest of his ticket, who seem to be getting 2 points or so less than him margin-wise.

**8:02 PM EST**  Polls have closed in Maine, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.  Looks like a Democratic rout in Virginia, with [huge swings in the House of Delegates as well.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=19636144#livepress-update-19636144)  Networks called NJ for Murphy at polls close.

**8:14 PM EST** Networks calling VA for Northam.  Looking downballot in VA, I am seeing about 15 House of Delegates seats where Democrats are leading Republican incumbents, though without checking anything other than lead at the moment.  Democrats would need to take 16 seats to take the House of Delegates.

**8:16 PM EST**  One of those changes in the VA House of Delegates is [Danica Roem, who becomes the first transgender person elected to the VA state legislature.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=13214256#livepress-update-13214256)

**8:24 PM EST**  Looks like Democrats are leading to [take 18 seats in the House of Delegates,](http://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/2017-election-live-coverage-results/?lpup=20841643#livepress-update-20841643) though some of those are still quite close.

**8:36 PM EST** It seems Democrats need 17 seats to take the House of Delegates because I am bad at math. Also Maine vote looks even right now, but heavily concentrated in rural areas reporting, so it might end up as a blowout yet.  Yes Mediciad expansion leading a bit.

**8:44 PM EST** President Trump has made his first over-140-character tweet, [and it was criticism of Gillespie.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/928074747316928513)

**8:49 PM EST**  Krasner [is winning](http://phillyelectionresults.com/) the Philly DA race handily so far.

**9:05 PM EST** Polls are now closed in New York.   Forgot to mention there's a NYC mayoral race, but it's not expected to be close.

**9:15 PM EST** With about 1/3 reporting, the Maine Medicaid referendum looks on track to be approved easily.

**9:34 PM EST** Looks like the New York ConCon is going down in flames.  80/20 against right now.

**10:13 PM EST** Maine Medicaid vote has been called for 'yes' by the Associated Press.  Utah 3rd congressional district (Jason Chaffetz' old seat) looks like a hold for Republicans.

**10:53 PM EST** Looks like the VA House of Delegates is going to end up in recounts and be very close on control.  Anyone know what happens there if it's exactly 50 R 50 D when the dust settles?  Also only notable race still outstanding seems to be the WA state senate race, where polls close in 5 minutes.

**11:01 PM EST** The new Republican congressman from Utah is Provo Mayor John Curtis, one of whose notable prior accomplishments is [replacing the godawful flag of Provo.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Provo,_Utah)  Seriously.  [Look at this flag.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Provo,_Utah#/media/File:Flag_of_Provo,_Utah_(1985-2015\).svg)  (Yes, I am violating the image linking rules and the neutrality rules.

**11:36 PM EST** Gonna end the tick tock here I think.  Big night for Democrats overall, and it will probably take a few days to sort out who controls the VA House of Delegates.  If anyone wants to make a NP post about how that works in a 50/50 tie that might be a good idea wink wink nudge nudge.

"America does not seem to have an interest in ""day fines,"" fining people a percent of their income. Why is that so?","[Wikipedia discusses day fines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-fine), commonly used in traffic violations. Day fines are somewhat common in Europe.  Excerpt:

>Jurisdictions employing the day-fine include Finland, Estonia, Sweden , Denmark, Germany, France, Switzerland, and Macao.

In some countries the fines can be rather high.  [Finland, Home of the $103,000 Speeding Ticket](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/)."
"How has ""Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act"" (2000) affected boxing in the US? What would be the effects of expanding it to cover MMA fighters?","Background:

* The [Ali Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Boxing_Reform_Act) was enacted in 2000 to address problems in American professional boxing, especially exploitation of athletes and conflicts of interest rampant among promoters. For example, by requiring boxing promotions to disclose financial information, it hoped to stop promotions from downplaying the income generated by fighters--which would in turn lead to fighters receiving a larger cut. It also hoped to make rankings more objective and harder to manipulate.

* Congressman [Markwayne Mullin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markwayne_Mullin) (R-OK) has introduced a related bill, the [Muhammad Ali Expansion Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/44). As the name implies, it would amend the original Ali Act to include mixed martial arts fighters. This is the second time Mullin has introduced the bill.

* While potential expansion has been discussed in MMA circles from time to time ([e.g., here's something from 2016](https://www.mmafighting.com/2016/6/12/11911444/click-debate-whats-all-this-talk-about-the-ali-act-coming-to-mma)), support of the bill by Democratic candidate Andrew Yang ([policy link](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/empowering-mma-fighters/)) has brought greater attention to the issue. (That's how I heard about it; of course, this thread is not about anything else related to Yang.)

* The UFC opposes expanding the Ali Act to include MMA. Of course it's easy to be cynical about this position, but I'd be interested in any good-faith [steelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man#Steelmanning) arguments here. For example, [here is a video](https://youtu.be/PFgR2gbzgiI) offering some criticisms of the need for the expansion bill. Also, it's worth remembering that the UFC is not the only MMA organization in the US

* As a general observation, professional boxers make much more money than professional MMA fighters. But this is not only due to fairer contract design; it's also because boxing is just a more popular sport, both for audiences (bigger revenue pool) and athletes (bigger talent pool).

* Fun fact: Congressman Mullin has a professional MMA record of 3-0. Bonus fun fact: Congresswoman [Sharice Davids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharice_Davids) (D-KS) is also a former professional MMA fighter. Bonus bonus coincidence: They are both of Native American heritage.

Questions:

1. Were these genuine problems in boxing at the time of the Ali Act's passage?

2. Are these less of a problem now?

3. If so, can this improvement be attributed to the Ali Act? 

4. Has enforcement of the Ali Act been effective?

5. General question: What have we learned about combat sports regulation with the benefit of 19 years of hindsight?

6. Are these a real problem in MMA now?

7. What are some potential downsides of expanding the Ali Act to include MMA?

8. What are some potential benefits?

9. If MMA does suffer from problems that plagued boxing before 2000, are there plausible alternative ways to address them that would avoid the downsides of amending the Ali Act?"

What are the economic pros and cons of Universal Basic Income?,"I took a look through [this page](https://www.procon.org/headline.php?headlineID=005363) regarding the pros and cons, but these are rather short, and it only provides a couple of arguments either way. 

One of the things about this specifically is a concern I had myself without even looking anything up, regarding the cost of UBI. I am aware that Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang [intends to use a value added tax](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/value-added-tax/), at least in part, to offset the cost of Universal Basic Income that he's suggesting [as his primary platform for the Presidency.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/) 

Can anyone provide any more context that I might be missing, studies that may have been done? I couldn't find anything on a scale larger than a few people, where Yang is proposing $1,000 a month for every citizen over 18. If this has some unforseen consequences I haven't yet read about, or even if there's a benefit I'm unaware of, as well as perhaps the actual legitimacy of using VAT to cover the cost of UBI?

How are the United States approaching corporate concentration and what regulatory lessons can we learn from the twentieth century?,"To quote one of my sources below:^[1](https://orionmagazine.org/article/the-curse-of-bigness/) 

> It’s an old story, and it bears repeating: Government subsidies favor large-scale standardized activity (in farming, manufacturing, retail — the list is long) at the expense of the local, the small, the diverse, the upstart. By 2005, four firms controlled 60 percent of the nation’s grain business. The four largest meatpackers controlled 70 percent of beef supply. In some states, the four largest grocery chains controlled as much as 88 percent of all retail sales. Today, a handful of merged energy companies, the Big Five, dominate the petroleum business, with ExxonMobil, Chevron-Texaco, Conoco-Phillips, BP, and Royal Dutch / Shell proving, in the words of Lord Browne, former chief executive of British Petroleum, that “many of the components of the old Standard Oil [trust have] been brought together.” The pattern of oligopoly holds in banking (Citigroup, Chase, and Bank of America now issuing one out of every two mortgages, two out of every three credit cards), accounting, tobacco, automobiles (the triopoly of GM, Ford, and Chrysler), defense, steel, telecommunications (Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint-Nextel), pharmaceuticals, airlines (Delta, American, United), in every major stage of the food business (even including grain elevator storage), and in the generation, transmission, and local distribution of electricity.

To clarify, I use the word *are* in the title because I believe the United States is a union of sovereign states populated by citizens and non-citizens.  If you attempt to answer this question, just know that I’m inquiring about both federal and state legislation in this policy area.

Why is there such stark divide between the prolific nature of this protest movement and election results, especially considering that MLK's million man march coincides with an [exceptionally strong majority vote by African Americans for the Democratic party?](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/04/blacks-and-the-democratic-party/)"
"What are the ethics, law, and precedent around unmasking anonymous people who allegedly oppose the US President?","Currently there are several controversies about anonymous people who have, in various ways, been construed as opponents of the US President:

# The Ukraine whistleblower

The ongoing [Trump–Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Ukraine_scandal) first came to light when an unnamed CIA officer [filed a whistleblower complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-idUSKBN1WB0E5). Although the complaint was secondhand information and has now been [corroborated by more direct evidence](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/776173492/the-whistleblower-complaint-has-largely-been-corroborated-heres-how), the President has [called](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/impeachment-trump-says-ukraine-whistleblower-should-identified/4053046002/) for public identification of the whistleblower and assessment of his credibility. For example, the president's son [tweeted](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/northamerica/top-stories/impeachment-trumps-son-tweets-name-of-alleged-whistleblower/ar-AAJX7Ee) a Breitbart article containing the name of someone suspected of being the whistleblower, and a false misidentification of the whistleblower [circulated on social media](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpkins-thought-this-man-was-the-whistleblower-they-were-wrong) although that person did not work in the government at the time. Republican members of the House of Representatives [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/in-impeachment-inquiry-republican-lawmakers-ask-questions-about-whistleblower-loyalty-to-trump-and-conspiracy-theories/2019/10/26/bf733450-f760-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html) used their questioning in recent closed-door hearings to identify the whistleblower. Senator Rand Paul, a libertarian-aligned Republican, [called on the media](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/04/rand-paul-demands-media-reveal-whistleblowers-name-do-your-job/4162211002/) to publish the alleged identity of the whistleblower.

# The anonymous op-ed and book author

Last year a ""senior administration official"" [published](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) an op-ed in the New York Times calling out mismanagement and dysfunction in the Trump administration, and is back in the news with [an excerpt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/book-by-anonymous-describes-trump-as-cruel-inept-and-a-danger-to-the-nation/2019/11/07/b6b6c6f2-0150-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html) from a forthcoming book. The President [demanded](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/nyt-trump-resistance-op-ed/index.html) that the Times ""must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!"", calling the op-ed [""TREASON?""](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1037464177269514240). Sen. Rand Paul [proposed](https://www.newsweek.com/rand-paul-trump-lie-detector-tests-trump-1110033) that the White House should use polygraph tests to ferret out the author.

# The alleged Roger Stone juror

The President's sometime adviser Roger Stone is [currently on trial](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comedian-takes-stage-trial-trump-adviser-roger-stone/story?id=66854483) for alleged lying to Congress and witness tampering in Robert Mueller's investigation of his alleged role as the intermediary between the Trump 2016 campaign and Wikileaks regarding the release of DNC emails hacked by the Russian government. His fellow InfoWars host Alex Jones [broadcasted](https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-goes-on-tirade-against-roger-stone-jurors) the name and face of a woman he claimed was a juror in the trial and also a former employee of the Obama administration, although he reportedly misidentified the woman and she was not empaneled on the final jury anyway.

---

All three of these people remain anonymous in the mainstream media and might be subject to political retaliation if exposed. However, they have all been accused of prejudice against the President and using their anonymity as a shield to cover their unfair attacks against him.

To what extent is their anonymity protected by ethical standards, legal statute, and prior precedent? In particular, what consequences can people in different positions face for exposing their identities and how are those consequences enforced? Do journalists, members of Congress, or the President have ways of broadcasting these identities with special immunity from the consequences that would normally fall upon private citizens?"
"What are the best practices in terms of secure, verifiable, and easy to use voting systems?","This year there were a number of controversies that popped up around [electronic voting machines in Texas](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/11/01/texas-straight-ticket-voting-problems-old-machines/) as well as [poorly designed paper ballots.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/11/12/how-badly-designed-ballot-might-have-swayed-election-florida/)  These actual issues also got mixed in with [baseless claims alleging fraud.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-s-unsubstantiated-claims-voter-fraud-florida-n935461)

American elections pose a challenge in that typically many offices are elected at the same time.  In many countries, the possibility of [snap elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election) means that there is no opportunity to coordinate multiple elections on the same day.

The US' [fixed election dates](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/7) allow that states and local governments can run elections scheduled to be voted on at the same time, which is why [Broward County Florida](https://cdn.ballotpedia.org/images/7/74/Florida_sample_ballot_%28Broward_County%29.pdf) used a 9 page long ballot with 39 separate voting opportunities on it.

This precludes something like the [extremely simple ballots used for Canadian parliamentary elections,](https://libblog.osgoode.yorku.ca/2015/10/election-special-2015-x-marks-the-spot-or-ballot-dos-and-donts/) especially with the necessity of explaining ballot initiatives as opposed to just candidate names.

Given these limitations, what systems tend to work best for the goals of:

1. Being secure against tampering, especially large scale tampering that could meaningfully alter results;

2. Being easy to use so that voters will be unlikely to unintentionally, undervote, overvote, or mistakenly vote for someone they did not intend to; and

3. Be verifiable so that public confidence in electoral integrity can be maintained?"
Should antitrust law and enforcement focus more on vertical integration?,"Net neutrality is the hot topic of the day but another issue at hand is antitrust. Amazon in particular has come under scrutiny after its [acquisition of Whole Foods Market](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/06/16/amazon-to-buy-whole-foods-market-in-deal-valued-at-13-7-billion-2/?utm_term=.81d2c0921199).

(Full disclosure: I work for Amazon but am obviously posting here in a private capacity.)

Historically, antitrust law has focused on horizontal monopolies, i.e., one firm cornering an entire market by crowding out competitors at the same stage of production. Vertical integration, in contrast, focuses more on owning the entirety of your upstream or downstream production chain. This is an oversimplification but is fine for the purpose of a high level conversation.

In the case of Amazon, acquiring Whole Foods gives them control of grocery distribution to supply their Fresh delivery system. To use another example, [look at the proposed merger between CVS and Aetna](https://www.economist.com/news/business/21730906-vertical-integration-could-put-brake-americas-unsustainably-soaring-health-care-costs):

>The CVS-Aetna deal is an effort at vertical integration, which by removing rent-seeking middlemen can, in theory at least, lead to more choice, better health outcomes and lower prices for consumers. If this seems far-fetched, consider the example of United’s pioneering use of data analytics and artificial intelligence at its in-house PBM.

Non-specific tidbits on the [argument in favor](https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21696911-tech-fashion-old-management-idea-back-vogue-vertical-integration-gets-new) of vertical consolidation:

- Better integrated products (i.e., creating an ecosystem in which it is easier to get everything you need in one space);
- Efficiency of doing things in-house;
- Building customer relationships (via integration and the subsequent creation of frictionless consumer experiences)
- Speed and efficiency from owning your entire production process;
- Minimizing risk across uncertain geopolitical space

The trade-off in this is the potential reduction of consumer choice and ""boxing in"" of customer behavior (see: [Vox's analysis](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2017/12/4/16731310/cvs-aetna-merger) of the Aetna/CVS merger for examples). Likewise, we can see privacy concerns, such as tech ecosystems that collect data in one capacity to inform another (e.g., Amazon using Whole Foods to collect customer behavior data to hone their advertisement algorithms).

Moreover, the reason why I mentioned net neutrality is because implicit in that argument is a concern over information limitation and throttling, but we can see examples of this with firms that own downstream production and content. Using Amazon as an example again, we have [historical examples](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/14/technology/amazon-hachette-ebook-dispute.html?_r=0) of the company deprioritizing book search results related to a publishing dispute. Today, Amazon and Google are in a spat that has resulted in the [loss of Youtube functionality](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices) across Amazon devices.

Thus there is significant control over content here, at least in so far as we have a major player in one market able to influence an area where they have a smaller share but nevertheless major influence on access to a good or service. This is a particularly acute concern where that influence is tethered to a medium or platform with a strong correlation to information dissemination, such as vieo.

The additional historical justification for antitrust law has been the argument that it's bad for consumers, typically by limiting their choice to a single firm that has significant price control. The traditional metrics have been market share and pricing.

But how should we evaluate vertical integration if: (1) it doesn't usually increase market share that much (e.g., Amazon still accounts for very little of the grocery market post-Whole Foods acquisition); (2) arguably it creates a better environment for consumers who want fast and frictionless goods/services, and; (3) we have yet to come up with a strong corollary for market share and price controls as the metrics for ""too much""?

Specific questions:

- Should this be policed more explicitly and increased rigor?
- What are the measurements by which we determine vertical integration has exceeded an appropriate threshold?
- Arguably this is more of a concern across data collection and communication areas. Is this less an antitrust concern and more of a communications and data security matter?"
Are lobbyists and diplomats who stay at Trump properties to positively influence him engaged in bribery?,"The [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/2016/11/18/9da9c572-ad18-11e6-977a-1030f822fc35_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_trumphotel-915pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory) had a story today with interviews with several foreign diplomats who indicated that they or others would likely deliberately stay at the Trump-branded and operated Old Post Office Hotel in Washington DC.

>In interviews with a dozen diplomats, many of whom declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak about anything related to the next U.S. president, some said spending money at Trump’s hotel is an easy, friendly gesture to the new president.

>“Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’ ” said one Asian diplomat.

Under federal law, bribery is described (in relevant part) as follows:

>Whoever directly or indirectly, corruptly gives, offers or promises anything of value to any public official or person who has been selected to be a public official, or offers or promises any public official or any person who has been selected to be a public official to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent:

>>(A) to influence any official act; or

>>(B) to influence such public official or person who has been selected to be a public official to commit or aid in committing, or collude in, or allow, any fraud, or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud, on the United States; or

>>(C) to induce such public official or such person who has been selected to be a public official to do or omit to do any act in violation of the lawful duty of such official or person;

>...shall be fined under this title or not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the thing of value, whichever is greater, or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.

So my question is: is the conduct described by the Washington Post bribery?  Does it require that Trump actually take an official action, or does the mere fact of giving Trump money + requesting official action on your behalf suffice?"
Impeachment & Removal - Campaign Procedure/Precedent & Party Responsibilities,"As [no President has been impeached and removed in US History](https://time.com/5552679/impeached-presidents/), I have a few questions about the process and how it would affect the GOP should it come to that:

* First, what is the precedent for past elevated VP's when it comes to running for reelection? Have they typically chosen new running mates and run as the primary candidate on the ticket, has the party nominated a new presidential candidate and they remain the VP on that ballot, or have they typically decided not to run?
* Second, what is the party's obligation in the case of removal from office, as it relates to an upcoming election? Do they have to stage primaries and debates? Or do they operate under the assumption that since the VP was chosen as the running mate, that he would be the de facto nominee? Would additional outside candidates have the chance to throw their hats in the ring?"
Does the U.S. Have a trade deficit or surplus with Canada?,"President Donald Trump [told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the US has a Trade deficit with Canada](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2018/03/14/in-fundraising-speech-trump-says-he-made-up-facts-in-meeting-with-justin-trudeau/?utm_term=.467b1fd0f248). [Some evidence](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/canada) suggests this is a lie, other evidence suggests it may have [be truthful](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-12/trump-may-actually-be-right-about-the-trade-deficit-with-canada). 

What do we know in terms of objective truth about this?"
Are Donald Trump's statements concerning Michael Cohen examples of witness tampering?,"President Trump's former attorney, [Michael Cohen, said on Wednesday that he will delay his testimony to Congress](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/23/687821794/trumps-ex-attorney-cohen-postpones-hill-testimony-citing-ongoing-threats). He cited 'threats' as the reason. His attorney cited 'ongoing threats'.

Cohen appears to have some Congressional support for his assertion of 'threats' by the President:

> Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland — chairman of the oversight committee — and Rep. Adam Schiff of California — chairman of the intelligence committee — also echoed earlier criticism of Trump for what they suggested was obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

> ""As we stated previously with our colleague, Chairman Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, efforts to intimidate witnesses, scare their family members, or prevent them from testifying before Congress are textbook mob tactics that we condemn in the strongest terms,"" Cummings and Schiff said.

Representative Ted Liu made [a similar assertion on witness tampering](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/426672-dem-lawmaker-cites-law-against-witness-tampering-after-cohen-cancels-testimony). 

---

Trump's response is that Cohen ""has been threatened by the truth.""

Some Congressional Republicans also dismissed Democrat's assertions of witness tampering (Citation 3, NY Times):

> The president’s allies in Congress dismissed the notion that his attacks constituted a threat to Mr. Cohen. “Everyone knows it wasn’t witness intimidation — c’mon,” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, said in a brief interview. “If he comes, we’ll be ready. If he doesn’t, he doesn’t.”

---

While neither Cohen nor his lawyer have stated what specific statements they view as threats, [Trump has repeatedly stated that Cohen and his family need further legal scrutiny](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/michael-cohen-testimony-postponed-congress.html).

> In a recent interview with Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host and one of Mr. Trump’s preferred interviewers, he called for Mr. Cohen’s father-in-law to be investigated without citing details.

The President also had [this](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069613383622803456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1069613383622803456&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F1%2F23%2F18194719%2Ftrump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat) pair of [Tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1069614615510859776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1069614615510859776&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F1%2F23%2F18194719%2Ftrump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat) criticizing Cohen's request at sentencing: 

> “Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time.” You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term? He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get...

> ....his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.

The President's lawyer, [Rudy Giuliani, has also participated in pointing towards Cohen's family members](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/23/18194719/trump-michael-cohen-father-in-law-threat):

> In an appearance on CNN Sunday, Rudy Giuliani went even further, stating flat-out that Cohen’s father in law, “a Ukrainian,” “may have ties to something called organized crime.”

> So, Giuliani continued, Cohen was happy to “lie” about Donald Trump in the hope of getting a reduced sentence, because “he’s afraid to testify against his father-in-law, because the repercussions for that will be far worse.”

I have a couple of questions:

1: What is witness tampering?

2: Are Donald Trump's statements towards Cohen examples of witness tampering?

What are the consequences of the Senate repealing H.J. Res 111 (consumer protections)?,"[Tonight the Senate, with Mike Pence casting a tie-breaker vote, voted to repeal the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arbitration rule](https://twitter.com/i/moments/923015620089626624) that allows consumers to band together to sue banks or credit card companies.

Initially, this seems to be a major blow for consumers trying to litigate against companies such as Equifax or Wells Fargo in the aftermath of major financial scandals.

My questions are:

1. Why would the GOP want to repeal this law? 
2. What benefits (if any) are there to consumers with this repealed?
3. What are the realistic consequences of this rule being repealed? What does it mean for consumers and financial institutions?

Looking for more evidence in the Russia election hacking situation,"So in this whole Russia election hacking story, I know of two ""hacks"": that resulted in the release of information - Podesta's emails and the DNC server.


I have no clue about electronic internet forensics but I do know that news is like an iceberg...we only see the tip, and it likely looks different from various angles.

After the president's recent comments about ""it could be Russia, it could be others...we don't know"" I started digging a little further as it appears that all the reporting has been that it was most certainly Russia.


In trying to understand more I came across at least two articles related to the DNC hack which clearly state that the DNC has never allowed any outside intelligence or investigative body access to their servers -


From January - http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/index.html


Just recently - http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/5/dnc-email-server-most-wanted-evidence-for-russia-i/


Is there any other corroborating evidence that can be gathered outside of the server that substantiates the claims of this private company?


Is there evidence that this private company can provide that could not possibly be faked or misleading that investigators can use to make their determinations?


In regards to the Podesta emails - I have seen no stories regarding NSA, CIA, or FBI investigators reviewing the information, but I am also aware that they would most likely not comment on ongoing investigations. I did however find articles stating that ""private cyber security"" firms confirm that the Russians were the source of the phishing scam

Here's one - http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/28/politics/phishing-email-hack-john-podesta-hillary-clinton-wikileaks/index.html


And another - https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/us/private-security-group-says-russia-was-behind-john-podestas-email-hack.html

Same questions apply. 

 
Lastly, were there attempted hacks of any republicans or the RNC that did not get the same amount of press coverage because they were unsuccessful?"
"Where can Assange go to avoid extradition by the US, and how can he get there from the Ecuadorian embassy?","[Sweden has just dropped charges against Assange](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/39973864), so he is no longer at risk of being extradited from Sweden to the US, but [the US has charges planned against him](https://www.rt.com/usa/385508-assange-justice-department-charges/), so he is still at great risk of being apprehended by that government.

* Where can Assange go, and how can he get there under broadly accepted diplomatic conventions (not asking about cloak & dagger), without being apprehended en-route?

There have been a few widely reported hate crimes over the past few months, some of which are true, while others have been debunked. 

Below are a few examples, which prompted this topic.


1) [The NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/us/black-church-burned-in-mississippi-with-vote-trump-scrawled-on-side.html?_r=0) reported on a black church being burned and ""vote trump"" written on it. It's later [confirmed](http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2016/12/22/man-charged-church-burning-requests-defender/95773264/) that the arsonist was an African-American member of the church.

2) [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerragriffin/drunk-men-yelling-donald-trump-attempt-to-remove-womans-hija) original article and addendum where the woman was arrested for filing a fake police report.

Some points of discussion:


A) What impact does this have on our political climate? An [interesting vice article](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/why-do-people-fake-hate-crimes) interviews two researchers who speculate that people are capitalizing on the current political climate and confirmation bias. They posit that most people will read these headlines, make a quick conclusion based on their ideology, and move on. Which leads me to my second point -

B) How does the average person sift through these incidents to uncover the truth?  There is no denying there is an increase in hate crimes in the USA [source](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/21/anti-muslim-assaults-reach-911-era-levels-fbi-data-show/), at least towards certain demographics (Muslims), but the rise of hoax hate crimes is at least, an interesting phenomena. My goal is to determine the facts, and this is becoming an increasingly effortful process."
"Who is an average ""climate change denier""?","I'm from the country with almost no public climate change debate. For a long time I thought that ""climate change denialism"" means in US literally denying climate change. 

It turned out, many people labeled by media in such way don't doubt the change itself, but rather extent of human influence or extent of potential negative effects. I had been mistaken by taking the meaning literally. 

So it seems there is a whole spectrum of people called denialists: from denial of any current dramatic change on the one side to impact indifference on the other (that is believing that change is happening and caused by humans and would lead to negative effects, but that these effects would be negligible in comparison to avoidance costs). As these positions cover a very broad range, is there some statistics on them for US? 

In wikipedia there are stats on perception of human influence and of potential threat. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country. But maybe there is more detailed analysis of positions spectrum somewhere? 

As a side question, what is **perception** in US of the ""denier"" label? That is, are US people as confused as me about it's actual meaning in variety of cases or there is a consensus on that? "

"To what extent is the Trump administration's exclusion of LGBTQ protections from its interpretation of Title IX motivated by a strict and literal interpretation of the law, and has the Trump administrated exhibited a pattern of policies detrimental to LGBTQ people?","The New York Times published an article titled [""Trump Administration Eyes Defining Transgender Out of Existence""](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html) whose first paragraph asserts:

However, the article later refers to the word ""sex"" instead of ""gender"" as the term that the Trump Administration is interpreting. Gender and sex are two distinct concepts; gender refers to psychological, behavioral, and cultural aspects of one's identity and is determined by brain structure whereas sex describes one's physical traits, such chromosomes, gonads, and genitalia. (https://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/sexuality-definitions.pdf, https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/)

According to the article, the Trump administration may interpret Title IX in a way that excludes protections for LGBTQ people, breaking the Obama administration's precedent. According to the article, people disagreed with the Obama administration's interpretation of the law:

> For the last year, health and human services has privately argued that the term “sex” was never meant to include gender identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections to people who should not have them.

[Title IX does not mention gender (or sexual orientation), only sex.](https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/titleix.htm)

- How does the Obama administration's interpretation of Title IX compare with other interpretations of the law, both Title IX and in general?

- Based both on its interpretation of Title IX and its other actions, to what extent is the Trump administration motivated by an earnest stricter or literal interpretation of the law, and has it shown a pattern of policies that harm LGBTQ people?

- What specific judgements has the Trump administration made regarding the definition of gender? Of sex? How are these definitions similar to or different from the medical consensus?

Does the reversal of the elephant trophy ban help or hinder conservation efforts long term?,"[The Trump administration has ended a ban on elephant trophies from Zimbabwe.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-reverses-obama-era-ban-on-import-of-elephant-trophies-from-zimbabwe/)

On the one hand, [as hunters argue](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/us/black-rhino-hunting-permit/index.html), sanctioned hunts can be auctioned off to raise substantial amounts of money for conservation efforts, and the ability to bring home trophies  can make this more appealing for wealthy hunters.

On the other hand, [poaching is still a significant threat to elephant populations](https://cites.org/eng/news/pr/2016_trends_in_African_elephant_poaching_released_–_CITES_MIKE_programme_03032017) and legalizing the import of trophies could expand the perceived market for poachers in America, giving them further motivation.

Given that both of these arguments are at least *feasible*, if not necessarily reality, what evidence is there as to what the net effect will be on elephant populations?

Edit: Additionally, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, [trophy bans are based in part by the US determining that these countries were not adequately contributing to conservation efforts](https://www.fws.gov/international/permits/by-activity/sport-hunted-trophies-elephants.html). This could be due to corruption in the local government purposefully auctioning more hunting rights than is sustainable, or auctioning off elephants which still have the capacity to breed."
What market solutions can be implemented to reduce COSTS in the US healthcare market?,"We pay vast sums

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP

For healthcare in the US, but insurance firms have low margins.



https://www.verywell.com/health-insurance-companies-unreasonable-profits-1738941

>How much do health insurers profit?
If we look average profit margins by industry, health insurance companies are pretty close to the bottom, with an overall average profit margin of just 3.3%. For perspective, the banking and real estate industries have profit margins that average over 20%, and major drug manufacturers average profit margins of nearly 22%.

>The ACA implemented MLR guidelines that require health insurance companies to spend the bulk of what they collect in premiums on medical claims. That automatically limits their administrative expenses - including executive compensation and profits - to no more than 20% of premium revenue.

>But there's no similar requirement for hospitals, device manufacturers, or drug manufacturers.

Seeing as (anecdotal statement) hopsitals can charge $100 for a single Tylenol is somewhat ridicules.

So what can be done via market solutions (or command) to reduce the costs to consumers placed on them by providers.

Things to think about that are costly: labor, legal, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment.

Edit: mods could you let some comments without sources stay, economics is one of those conversation topics that simply require a specific type of philosophical mindset and less source porn."

I saw a lot common talking about protection for vulnerable transgender students and how this move is an attack on the rights of LGBT groups in the United States.

What are the merits of automatic voter registration?,"Today is National Voter Registration Day in the US.  Reddit's admins asked us to post about this and link to [their blog post](https://redditblog.com/2017/09/25/reddit-is-partnering-with-national-voter-registration-day/) on the subject.  

---

Now with the PSA part out of the way, I'd like to ask about the merits of automatic voter registration, whose goal is to make things like National Voter Registration Day unnecessary.

[Ten states currently use some form of automatic voter registration.](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/automatic-voter-registration)

In general, such policies automatically register voters when they interact with the DMV [unless they opt out.](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-voter-registration.aspx) Though Alaska does it when people get [their permanent fund dividends.](https://pfd.alaska.gov/Automatic-Voter-Registration)

In all states, there is an opt out, as opposed to the opt-in of the [motor-voter act.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Voter_Registration_Act_of_1993)

What are the pros and cons of moving towards a system of automatic voter registration?  Should a federal automatic registration law be passed?"
What are the causes of California's housing shortage? What steps can they take to address the shortage?,"Back in 1978, before California's housing boom, the Californian people passed [Proposition 13](https://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf) which rolled back and froze property tax values to the 1976 assessed value. Property tax increases were also limited to no more than 2% per year as long as the property was not sold. When the house was sold the property was reassessed at 1% of the sale price. It now seems that with the increasing housing prices we are seeing a spike in out-migration from California, as per this study from [California's Legislative Analyst's Office](https://lao.ca.gov/laoecontax/article/detail/265), between the years 2007 to 2016 the state lost a new 1 million residents. Now despite the fact that it is now cheaper to hold onto land as opposed to selling it, and sky rocketing home prices( [With California's median home price now topping $600,000) as per the California Association of Realtors](https://www.car.org/en/aboutus/mediacenter/newsreleases/2018releases/May2018homesales)) , why is it that we aren't seeing a co-equal influx in housing construction in California to meet the 180,000 needed annual construction of new homes ([as per a 2018 study from California's Housing Future: Challenges and Opportunities the amount of newly constructed homes only averaged less than 80,000 homes annually](http://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/plans-reports/docs/sha_final_combined.pdf))"
When does a president's economic record begin?,"I want to acknowledge at the outset that a president doesn't have sole control over the economy. There are a variety of other factors working in concert, and many have nothing to do with the president, or even government policy in general, so I'm expecting that a lot of this is just undeterminable. 

Nevertheless, every US election cycle is peppered with arguments about who to credit or blame for the state of the economy, and most of them come down to timing: Did the president inherit the problems, or were they a result of his own policies?

For example, the [dot-com bubble burst](https://worldhistoryproject.org/2000/3/13/the-market-opens-4-lower-on-monday-than-it-closed-on-friday) at the end of the Clinton administration, but GW Bush was primarily the one to deal with the fallout. In turn, the [Great Recession hit full stride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession_in_the_United_States) at the end of Bush's term, but it was mostly Obama who had to deal with that one. 

At present, we've got the president-elect receiving credit for some economic changes — such as manufacturing shifts at [Carrier](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/29/donald-trump-indiana-factory-jobs-carrier-mexico) and [Ford](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-thanks-ford-motor-company-233172) — before even taking office. He has also [claimed credit for a December jump in the Consumer Confidence Index.](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-on-soaring-consumer-confidence-thanks-donald-2016-12-28)

If it weren't for situations like those, I'd be tempted to suggest we should start assigning credit/blame when the President's [first budget takes effect,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget) which, if it is approved on time, would be October of the year of inauguration, or nearly a year after the election. Using that standard, the Obama administration has overseen continual growth in [GDP](http://imgur.com/a/DtV1c) and [employment,](http://cdn.tradingeconomics.com/embed/?s=usurtot&v=201701061339r&d1=20070101&d2=20171231&h=300&w=600) but also the continued trend of [widening income inequality.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/america-income-inequality-wealth-net-worth-charts)

So, before the inauguration of a new president, I'd like to see if we can quantify some of this stuff. Is there a way to break down which economic policy outcomes can be attributed to which administration? Can reasonably solid causation be determined, or is any metric inherently subjective?

[META] How to write a successful submission for /r/NeutralPolitics (2019),"In honor of the seventh birthday of /r/NeutralPolitics, the mods have asked me, a frequent poster, to make a post addressing one of the long-standing issues with submissions: most posts don’t get approved, and a few break the rules in such a way that they can’t be fixed. 

The rules for /r/NeutralPolitics are [well laid out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), and /u/huadpe did a great job making a [submission-tip-list last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/), but if you’re like me, you probably don’t check the rules as you're making your post, or you do so sparingly. 

So since /u/huadpe's post is so good (really the post is very specific and quite helpful - I suggest you check it out) and the rules so well laid out, I’m going to take a slightly different and more informal approach from last year: I have 3 general tips for help organizing questions and setting your expectations.

**1: Figure out who said the thing**

Whether you heard it at work/school or read it on the internet, there’s a good chance you first came across an interesting topic as:

> “The left/right/Republicans/Democrats/scientists/ a conservative think tank/ a liberal economist, said...”

As you're laying out the background for the topic in your post, start by sourcing who introduced the topic. You don't necessarily need to give a specific name in in all cases, but I find starting with sources that correctly attribute where ideas came from helps organize the question with relevant background info. Including a source with the person who said something also tells their relative position within an organization and helps assess how serious a move or statement it is. 

**2: You're asking for explanations for things on the internet**

Don’t ask for the impossible. The thing that /r/NeutralPolitics's commenters do best is synthesize multiple internet sources to provide a coherent answer to your narrow questions, but if your question doesn't require outside sources to answer, it's in the wrong place. If a poster can't answer a question with something on the internet, you might instead be seeking speculation or pure opinion from redditors.

**3: Already approved posts offer great instructions for how to frame new topics**

The subreddit's [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) does a great job covering the specifics of post submissions, but if you're still unsure about how to frame your question, simply look to recently approved posts. You can use approved posts to get a sense of how the subreddit's rules work in action, and then use the same language to frame your own question.

Thanks to /u/nosecohn for help with this post. We want this to be an interactive thread so please ask the mods or me any questions you may have.

Thanks!"
"What is the significance of there being a counterintelligence investigation vs. a criminal investigation into the President? What is the difference, and has this happened to other elected US government offices?","On Friday the [NY Times broke a story](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/fbi-trump-russia-inquiry.html) that the President was a part of a 'counterintelligence' investigation, separate from the obstruction investigation, which falls under a 'criminal' investigation and has long been known about.

The Times reports the counterintelligence elements were eventually folded into the criminal investigation:

> The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.’s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.

The Times notes that the FBI does two types of inquiries, broken down as:

> The F.B.I. conducts two types of inquiries, criminal and counterintelligence investigations. Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests.

It's noted that not all former law enforcement officers agree with this move: 

> A vigorous debate has taken shape among some former law enforcement officials outside the case over whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a tumultuous period at the Justice Department. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty.

---

I have a few questions:

1: What does it mean, or what is the significance of the President being investigated on a counterintelligence level vs. a regular criminal investigation?

2: For a person being investigated, what is the difference between a criminal and counterintelligence investigation? Will you not be told you're under investigation, etc?

3: Is there any precedent for this, as in have there been other government employees or elected officials that have been targeted in counterintelligence investigations?

[META] Updates to the rules in r/NeutralPolitics,"Dear users,

Today we're announcing a few small updates to the rules and procedures. Some of these were already mod policy, but hadn't been added to the official guidelines yet. Others are new.


**1. The table in the [sources section of the guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) has two new lines to deal with personal blogs and tweets:**

Source type | Submissions | Comments
---|---|----
Personal blogs* | Disallowed | Permitted if the blog post links to qualified non-blog sources
Tweets | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder

This means tweets may not be used to support any assertion of fact other than a claim of attribution. For instance, a [tweet from the NeutralPolitics Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NeutralPolitic/status/1022531083341058048) saying, ""NeutralPolitics has the best looking mods on all of Reddit!"" cannot be used to support assertions about the attractiveness of the mods. It can only be used to demonstrate that the NeutralPolitics mod team *stated* it has the most attractive mods (even though it happens to be true).

 \*A personal blog is defined as a blog with any one of the following characteristics: only has one contributor, allows anonymous contributors without editorial oversight, doesn't have a masthead.

**2. Users may not post top-level comments on their own submissions.** Such comments will be automatically removed.

The review process for submissions is strict and detailed in NeutralPolitics. The mods view top-level comments by submitters as a way to circumvent that process, adding content that would not have been approved under the submission rules. Submitters are free to participate in the discussion as replies to other users.

**3. Submissions asking whether something is ""unusual"" (and other variations using that word) are no longer allowed.** They are considered non-specific and leading, and as such, violate submission rules A and B. 

 Submitters may still pose questions that examine historical standards and expectations in any of the following more evidence-based forms:

* Is there historical precedent for x?
* What are some examples of when x has happened before?
* In what ways, if any, does x break from historical norms?
* What legal/political/historical basis is there for X to be considered?

**3. Links that redirect from Google are now allowed**, so long as they don't disguise the final destination in the URL (e.g., https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-california-pension-liabilities-20180118-story.html). Other redirecting links are still prohibited.

**4. After a [16-month hiatus,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5xr3xn/meta_rneutralpolitics_is_opting_out_of_rall_and/) r/NeutralPolitics has returned to r/all on a trial basis.** As always, this runs the risk of attracting participants who don't follow the rules, so we remind our long-time users that the mods rely on reports to find comments that are in violation.

**5. Our sister subreddit, r/NeutralNews, needs more mods and submitters.** See [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/91srzl/meta_call_for_mods_and_feedback_summer_2018/)"
"[META] Announcing a revised rule 3, and a request for help.","Based on [feedback from users](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7j50ps/meta_seeking_user_feedback_on_insults_directed_at/) and discussion among the mod team, we have decided to revise sidebar rule 3 to read as follows:

>3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

We believe this formulation better reflects the ethos of what we're asking of our users on NP.  The main change from the prior rule 3 is the specific prohibition on ""pejorative name calling.""  This prohibits using nicknames and slurs, except where the person using them intends to state that they're literally accurate.  In that case, a sourced explanation of why the name ascribed is accurate is permitted by the rules.

In addition, we added language that ""NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion based subreddit.""  This reflects the general ethos of what we're after here, and also allows for room to remove content which is nonserious but doesn't fit neatly into another rule, such as obvious trolling.

We are in the process of updating our automod rules to report (not remove) comments which contain keywords which are likely to violate this policy.  To that end, we need your help in composing a list of nicknames and substitute names which are very likely to be in violation of the rules.  We already have slurs and most regular insults in our automod filters - we're just looking for more public figure related ones now.

**Please help us out by giving us a list of names which we can put into automod.**

We won't take it personally."
What to look for in the House Science Committee's upcoming hearing on Climate Science.,"Thanks to /u/sighbourbon for the original version of this post.

The US House of Representatives has scheduled a Full Committee Hearing for this Wednesday on the topic: [*Climate Science: Assumptions, Policy Implications, and the Scientific Method.*](https://science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/full-committee-hearing-climate-science-assumptions-policy-implications-and) The [charter](https://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/HHRG-115-SY-20170329-SD001.pdf) includes a list of witnesses and states:

>The purpose of this hearing is to examine the scientific method and process as it relates to climate change. The hearing will also focus on the underlying science that helps inform policy decisions.

That brings up the following questions:

1. Is this committee qualified to ""examine the scientific method and process""?  
2. Does the witness list indicate representation of mainstream scientific positions?
3. What, if anything, does the outcome of such hearings historically tell us about the policy goals of the body that convenes them?
4. What policies does the committee control that can be affected by the outcome of this hearing?

"Hillary Clinton is often described as a ""moderate"" or ""centrist."" Does the evidence support this?","Going in to this election, my personal impression of Clinton was that she was a liberal. Not extremely liberal, but not [""center left""] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/06/13/hillary-clinton-the-center-lefts-champion/) and certainly not [""a Republican in Democrats' clothing,""] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-brasunas/there-is-a-moderate-republican-in-this-race_b_9704194.html) as she is sometimes described today. After doing research, my perception of her as a liberal seems to be more accurate, based on actual evidence.

Evidence: looking at her senate voting record at [dwnominate,] (http://www.voteview.com/dwnl_for_friends.html) we can see that Clinton was more liberal than 70% of all Democrats and 85% of all house members in her last term in the senate. If you feel that's too small a sample size, we can look at her public statements over the course of her entire career. [Ontheissues.org] (http://www.ontheissues.org/hillary_clinton.htm) keeps track of public statements by politicians and rates them on a left-right scale; by this analysis, she qualifies as a ""hard-core liberal."" [This point is also emphasized in a post at fivethirtyeight.] (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/hillary-clinton-was-liberal-hillary-clinton-is-liberal/)  (link provided by /u/Phantazein.)

The purpose of this thread is not really to convince everyone that Clinton is an uber-liberal (and further, it's not clear that this is necessarily a good or bad thing), but rather, to discuss the disparity between her image as a moderate/centrist and her actual voting record and her public statements, which look pretty solidly liberal to me. 

Why does this disparity exist, and what does it tell us? "

"Several laws have come into effect in France. They aim to limit food riots (most prominently remembered over Nutella), to pay farmers more, and to strengthen small producers overall. What evidence supports the pros and cons of this legislation?","In the first three months of this year, several laws came into effect in France that aim to limit riots over discount foods, to distribute equity more fairly among stores and farmers, and to strengthen small producers by making big brand products more expensive.

---

Partially in response to discount food [riots in 2018 over steep Nutella discounts](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42866417), France [passed legislation](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/31/france-slap-legal-limits-food-discounts-wake-nutella-riots/) to stymy the cause of rioting at big box stores.

In January, France first put limits on how steep discounts can go:

> ...limit discounts to 34 per cent – half the Nutella price cuts...

In [March, they effectively killed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2019/02/16/big-brand-food-shopping-just-got-more-expensive-in-france/#79676a32a165) 'buy one get one free' promotions:

>  ...the amount of promotions which are allowed will be limited to just a quarter of the planned sales. So if a supermarket wants to sell 100 tubs of Nutella, from March, it can only run promotional offers on 25 of them.

---

In February, France effectively raised the cost of certain foods by 10%, but it's a little more complicated than that. According to French Minister of Agriculture and Food, Didier Guillaume, [the purpose is to spread more equity to farmers](https://www.20minutes.fr/economie/2439575-20190130-loi-alimentation-changements-panier-courses-vendredi) (Google translated from French, full interview [here](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/8h30-fauvelle-dely/loi-alimentation-il-faut-peut-etre-que-la-distribution-fasse-moins-de-profits-affirme-didier-guillaume_3146611.html)):

> ""What I'm asking big box stores is to find a way to spread the margins differently, to distribute things better, the objective is that agricultural products are sold at their fair value,"" argued the minister. The State hopes that, in return, the distribution will better pay producers from all sectors of agriculture and aquaculture, struggling because regularly paid below their cost.

Some more specific info on this measure (from source 4, 20Minutes, and through Google Translate):

> The recent Food Law raised the ""resale loss threshold"" or SRP to 10%. The government wants to force distributors to sell their calling products at prices 10% higher than those they have purchased. These products, which generate no profit but attract the barge, can no longer be sold at a loss. Specifically: a product bought 1 euro must be sold at least 1.10 euro.

> From 1 February, in supermarkets, ""500 products out of 13,000"" should increase, while in hypermarkets ""it is 800 products out of 20,000"" are concerned, according to the minister, who confirmed by relativizing information published in Le Parisien. Rather, they are consumer goods manufactured mostly by food giants (Danette, Coca-Cola, Caprice des Dieux, Ricard, Nutella, etc.) used by distributors in their promotional communication to attract the public. According to the Paris daily newspaper, the 750g Nutella pot would thus go from 4.05 to 4.39 euros, ie an 8.4% increase.

----

Cumulatively the effect of these laws strengthens the position of smaller suppliers (source 3, Forbes):

> The rationale is that supermarkets attract customers through promotional material of big brand products such as Coca-Cola, Danette, Ricard and Nutella, with whom smaller producers cannot compete. It’s an attempt to help farmers and smaller producers to become more competitive as they are now guaranteed a fair price.

How and how quickly should the US and other developed nations adopt renewable energy?,"Adoption of renewable energy has accelerated in the West in the last few years. Last year an estimated 25% of new energy generation [came from wind](https://www.utilitydive.com/news/doe-more-than-a-quarter-of-2016-capacity-additions-were-wind/448946/), while solar capacity [nearly doubled](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-solar-market-grows-95-in-2016-smashes-records). Spain currently gets [nearly half](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/09/47-spains-electricity-made-renewables-march/) of its electricity from renewables, and a recent French government report [has claimed that](https://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/14/100-renewable-electricity-2050-possible-france/) France could go 100% non-nuclear renewable by 2050 without significant additional expense.

However, plenty of concerns remain.

Additionally, a [recent trade case](http://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/359443-if-trump-is-looking-out-for-consumers-hell-reject-solar-tariffs) may significantly damage further solar prospects in the US. Meanwhile, major nuclear projects have [stalled](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/climate/nuclear-power-project-canceled-in-south-carolina.html) in the US, questioning the future of nuclear as ""green"" renewable and natural gas prices fall. It has also been pointed out that a transition to renewables would require a [massive overhaul](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/modernizing-us-energy-grid) of the US grid, at significant short term expense. Additionally, a [range of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_wind_power) have been raised about heretofore unforeseen negative environmental effects of various renewables.

it seems clear that President Trump is trying to apply learned business practices to the governance of the United States (or at least the running of the Executive Branch), specifically the ""cut the fat"" reorganization strategy that corporations typically go through when merged or acquired by a new company.

> Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the 1980s and early 1990s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, 2015). Indeed, recent research on downsizing in the U.S.,[6] UK,[7] and Japan[8][9] suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance.

What are the arguments for and against Canada being a national security threat to U.S. steel production?,"President Trump [recently imposed steel tariffs on several countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-imposes-steel-and-aluminum-tariffs-on-the-european-union-canada-and-mexico/2018/05/31/891bb452-64d3-11e8-a69c-b944de66d9e7_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.be2c1ad54bdf) on the basis that steel imports harm national security. 


----------------------------

It has been [well reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/trump-tariffs-foreign-autos.html) that the President of the United States has broad authority to impose tariffs on products that detract from U.S. national security.

> The statute gives the president broad authority to restrict imports that threaten national security.

Bolstering his position, President Trump has cited [a report](https://www.commerce.gov/sites/commerce.gov/files/the_effect_of_imports_of_steel_on_the_national_security_-_with_redactions_-_20180111.pdf) published by the U.S. Department of Commerce that asserts steel imports harm national security in the long run.

However the Commerce Department report addresses Canada directly:

> Our goal is to maximize domestic capabilities combined with supplies from unquestionably reliable third parties. The one supplier in whom I have complete confidence is Canada. Not only do we currently have a steel surplus with Canada, but we share a border and have synergistic strategic, economic, and national security interests. However, treating Canada as a unique partner under any Section 232 relief measures requires that Canada also strengthen and align its trade enforcement efforts with ours. [Appendix F, p.60]

This seems to indicate Canada and the United States share a special relationship in regards to trade, and steel specifically, and also seems to weaken the argument (while not entirely) that Canada is a threat to U.S. national security of steel production.

---------------------------------

These broad arguments for and against understanding Canada as a threat to U.S. steel production all come from the Commerce Department, and quite frankly they are a bit confusing.  Including additional domestic and foreign reports/sources, what are the arguments for and against Canada being a threat to U.S. steel production? 

---- This question is very limited - I do not want to raise the significantly more complicated question of whether this is good idea for *the overall relationship* between the U.S. and Canada. This already seems to be very much in the public discussion, and I think in this case will side track from the question.

What public positions has Trump/The Trump Administration taken in respect to unions?,"Wondering what Trump has said and done regarding unions both as a politician and as a businessman.

Google provided mixed results. A mod here showed me this [Speech Trump gave to a labor union a few months ago.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/04/remarks-president-trump-2017-north-americas-building-trades-unions) Trump discusses wanting to keep these workers gainfully employed. To do this, he says he's taking action ""...to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way."" However, he didn't make the distinction that despite this plan, regulations protecting unions would remain safe. 

Last and most importantly, I'm wondering how his thoughts and actions will affect unions moving forward.

"[META] Important Reminder (or ""Make NeutralPolitics Great Again"")","Hi all,

Many of you have recently noted a drop in the quality of discussion on NeutralPolitics. We on the mod team have noted the same, and would like to remind everyone of a few key rules that are critical to the success of the sub.

## Assume good faith

We are all here because we want the best for our respective country and collective world. We don't always agree - in fact, we shouldn't always agree. This space is for us to bounce ideas off of a variety of perspectives, and to gain understanding based on how they respond.
As such, assume good faith when interacting with other members of the NeutralPolitics community. The fact that you and another user advocate for different solutions doesn't mean that you aren't both trying for the best outcome. You may view their solution as bad, and they probably view yours likewise. Accept that and look at the evidence together.


## Sweat the details

Each of us has wide-reaching opinions built on mountains of small facts and assumptions that accumulate to form a worldview. It's all too easy to avoid questioning those assumptions, but this community is an opportunity to test them in order to expand our own understanding of politics and society. If a discussion seems to have come to an impasse, try exploring the components that make up your respective opinions.


## Show your work

This community is dedicated first and foremost to quality information and clear presentation of solid logic. Only with those can we fuel quality discussion. Take the time to understand why you believe what you believe, show us the evidence or underlying logic, and cite your sources.


## Engage with the argument, not the person

Things can get heated when discussing hot-button topics, but please stay focused on the argument, not on making attacks against the person. Even when that doesn't result in a flame war, it still shuts down productive discussion.


We will be increasing our presence in the subreddit, including distinguished posts to provide pointers when we see comments that may not merit removal, but are still not in line with the standard of quality that you all have (hopefully!) come to expect of this subreddit. If you have any questions or suggestions, we are as always happy to chat.

Thank you for reading and let's keep up our reputation as the best place for political discussion on reddit!"
What are the pros and cons of nationalising the U.S. Defense Industry?,"Recently, I've read this [post by John Stanton](https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/07/06/nationalize-the-defense-industry/) where he's arguing that the U.S. Defense Industry should be nationalised. In which, he discusses what he sees as issues with how the military and defence works, and how nationalising would help solve these problems. 

Some context:

Dwight D. Eisenhower warned Americans of a [Military Industrial Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military%E2%80%93industrial_complex) - which is ""an alliance between military officers and corporations that supply the military that does not serve the public interest.""

Some groups have pushed in favour of further use of private military contractors. Well known Conservative thinktanks have called for [higher levels of privatization on military maintanence](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/privatizing-military-maintenance), while others, including Jared Kushner, have also called for [hirings of so-called ""private armies"", such as Blackwater](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-michaels-privatization-military-20170720-story.html) for deployment abroad. 



U.S. military spending has continued to [increase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/04/18/us-military-spending-set-increase-fifth-consecutive-year-nearing-levels-during-height-iraq-war/), meanwhile the top 100 companies around the world with military contracts, such as [Boeing and Raytheon,](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-top-9-biggest-defense-contractors-in-america-2016-5?r=US&IR=T#3-raytheon-company-3)  saw [$389 billion in total arms sales in 2018](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/02/21/military-spending-defense-contractors-profiting-from-war-weapons-sales/39092315/). President Trump has been [warm to large military budgets](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/10/pentagon-eyes-windfall-as-trump-seeks-750-billion-defense-budget-military/), and has even nominated former Boeing board member, Patrick Shanahan, to [lead the Pentagon](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/05/10/trump-nominates-embodiment-military-industrial-complex-patrick-shanahan-lead).

Can the President or a regular citizen be held liable for defaming a news organization?,"For reference: [defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation)

> Defamation, calumny, vilification, or traducement is the communication of a false statement that harms the reputation of, depending on the law of the country, an individual, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation.

> Under common law, to constitute defamation, a claim must generally be false and must have been made to someone other than the person defamed. Some common law jurisdictions also distinguish between spoken defamation, called slander, and defamation in other media such as printed words or images, called libel.

Per accounts in the Mueller Report, President Trump lied and encouraged others to lie regarding reports from the media, and he used those lies as evidence of ""fake news"". 

From [AP](https://www.apnews.com/06c88719c3634e66a15adbbc658978b0)

>  [T]he Mueller’s report shows The New York Times and the Washington Post were correct when they reported in January 2018 that Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to make sure Mueller was fired, and that McGahn decided to resign rather than carry that out. When the Times first reported the story, Trump described it as “fake news, folks, fake news.”

> The Mueller report also showed that Trump directed a series of aides to ask McGahn to publicly deny the story, and ultimately asked himself, too. McGahn refused, saying the story was accurate, the report found.

Could specific instances of examples like the one above be used to show that the President has caused harm to the business via defamation?

For example, if the NYT could show a decline in subscribers or demographics and could correlate that to Trump's ""fake news""/lies could the President be held liable?

Follow up question, could a regular citizen be held liable for the same scenario?


Here is an additional reference regarding defamation.

[NOLO](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/defamation-law-made-simple-29718.html)

> The law of defamation varies from state to state, but there are some generally accepted rules. If you believe you are have been ""defamed,"" to prove it you usually have to show there's been a statement that is all of the following:

> * published
* false
* injurious
* unprivileged

Unprivileged wasn't clear to me. Here is the NOLO explanation. 

> [T]o qualify as a defamatory statement, the offending statement must be ""unprivileged."" Under some circumstances, you cannot sue someone for defamation even if they make a statement that can be proved false. For example, witnesses who testify falsely in court or at a deposition can't be sued. (Although witnesses who testify to something they know is false could theoretically be prosecuted for perjury.) Lawmakers have decided that in these and other situations, which are considered ""privileged,"" free speech is so important that the speakers should not be constrained by worries that they will be sued for defamation. Lawmakers themselves also enjoy this privilege: They aren't liable for statements made in the legislative chamber or in official materials, even if they say or write things that would otherwise be defamatory."

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have *time*. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/index) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

Mods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. Roughly 70% of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and or work with them to craft an acceptable post.

Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. In order to help new users acclimate to our standards of discourse, we are refocusing our efforts to maintain moderator presence in the comments, so you'll be expected to reply to some of those as well.  

Other responsibilities include:

* Message an OP asking him to modify his submission.
* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with a brief explanation of why you want to join the team and why you would be a good fit and also include your stance on avocado toast.

"Who is actually affected by the Trump administration's ""public charge"" rule?","First time poster, please forgive any errors in formatting.

&#x200B;

Last October, new rules regarding who would be a public charge for immigration purposes would have gone into effect, but they were blocked by several lawsuits.  The Supreme Court has recently lifted the injunction against implementing the rule  [https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/484196-supreme-court-allow-public-charge-rule-to-take-effect-across-country)

According to the text of the rule ( [https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet](https://www.uscis.gov/news/fact-sheets/public-charge-fact-sheet)), the benefits that are included are:

* Supplemental Security Income;  
* Temporary Assistance for Needy Families; 
* Any federal, state, local, or tribal cash benefit programs for income maintenance (often called general assistance in the state context, but which may exist under other names);  
* Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly called food stamps); 
* Section 8 Housing Assistance under the Housing Choice Voucher Program; 
* Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance (including Moderate Rehabilitation);  
* Public Housing (under the Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.); and 
* Federally funded Medicaid (with certain exclusions). 

The rule applies to those who are seeking to adjust their status to become a legal permanent resident or certain nonimmigrants.

However, most nonimmigrants are ineligible for these benefits  [https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/](https://immigrationforum.org/article/fact-sheet-immigrants-and-public-benefits/) .  If there is a U.S. Citizen child in the household that would qualify for the benefits, that is not supposed to be held against the immigrant as the child would be entitled to receive them.

There are certain exceptions to the rule, ie. these are not held against the immigrant for purposes of determining a public charge, and include-

* Emergency medical assistance;  
* Disaster relief;  
* National school lunch programs;  
* The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children ;  
* The Children’s Health Insurance Program;  
* Subsidies for foster care and adoption;  
* Government-subsidized student and mortgage loans; 
* Energy assistance;  
* Food pantries and homeless shelters; and 
* Head Start.    

Certain categories of immigrants are also excluded, including refugees, asylees, T and U Visa applicants, and certain VAWA applicants.

So, my question is- Given that the vast majority of federal public benefits are off-limits to nonimmigrants, and the groups of people and types of assistance that are already not subject to the rule, who will actually be affected? "
What are the arguments for and against expunging marijuana convictions in legalization legislations?,"I was recently reading an article in the NYT about marijuana legalization laws hitting a wall in New York and New Jersey.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/marijuana-legalization-ny-nj.html)

One of the points the article mentions about New Jersey, when talking about possibly reviving the legalization movement there, is that:

>...in New Jersey, the proposal’s sponsors have discussed changing the current bill, including removing an expungement provision that would have cleared convictions for people who were caught in possession of up to five pounds of marijuana.

It seems the expungement of marijuana convictions is a controversial topic when trying to pass these legislations. Looking at other states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, the topic of expungement is indeed controversial: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they\_n\_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prosecutors-can-help-erase-old-weed-convictions-so-why-arent-they_n_5ae9e76fe4b06748dc8ed3da)

Given what' I've read, the arguments **for** seem to relate to fairness as well as civil rights:

>“I think the simplest way of looking at it for us is just that these people have convictions that if they were to commit them today they wouldn’t be a crime,” Jiron said. “So it seems unfair to basically saddle them with a conviction for something that is now legal.” 

And on the Civil Rights front:

>The nation’s war on drugs has disproportionately harmed low-income and communities of color — blacks are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for possession of marijuana than whites, despite similar rates of use of the drug, according to the[ American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white).

On the **against** side, the article quotes this argument:

>Some prosecutors can be hesitant about retroactive relief over concerns that a marijuana conviction may be just one of many charges that were once filed against a defendant, Eisen said. That’s because more than 90 percent of felony convictions at both the state and federal level are the result of plea bargains. If a defendant is facing multiple charges, the plea process allows for them to plead guilty to a lesser crime, while not facing a trial, and possible conviction, for the more serious charges. But charges that weren’t brought shouldn’t necessarily be held against a defendant, Eisen said.

So my questions are:

1. How do jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana address these concerns about other offenses that are not in the books?
2. Are there any other arguments for or against expunging marijuana convictions (as part of legalization efforts OR after the fact)?

Side Note: New Jersey and New York are special in this case as they are the first **states** ([some territories have](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2018/09/21/governor-signs-marijuana-legalization-bill-making-history-in-us-territory/#539b23f027ea))  to try to pass recreational legalization by state legislation ([https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline\_of\_cannabis\_laws\_in\_the\_United\_States#/State](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_cannabis_laws_in_the_United_States#/State)).

Indexing Andrew Yang's Freedom Dividend,"Andrew Yang's Universal Basic Income or ""Freedom Dividend"" proposal is to give $1,000 per month to every adult American who opts-in to the policy ([https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/)) (https://thinkprogress.org/andrew-yang-ubi-automation-profile-1b0957cc12b7/). Yang has stated the precise payout will eventually fluctuate by pegging the overall dollar amount to a particular resource, and he has made an express comparison to the Alaska Permanent Fund's annual individual payouts to certain Alaska state residents ([https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478](https://youtu.be/-DHuRTvzMFw?t=1478)) (https://quillette.com/2019/03/06/in-defense-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend/).

Alaska's individual payouts are determined according to a set formula that averages the five year performance of the Alaska Permanent Fund (which is funded with a portion of state oil revenues) ([https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917](https://www.reuters.com/article/alaska-payment-fund/alaska-residents-to-receive-record-payment-from-oil-royalty-fund-idUSL1N11N03U20150917)). Yang has indicated (in the clip above, a podcast that ran this Sunday; link is timestamped) that his UBI's individual payout amount would fluctuate with the profitability of artificial intelligence. 

Question: is it possible to treat an entire discrete industry as a resource for the sake of indexing the size and payout of a national social program to that industry's profitability? Do any other social programs in the U.S. fluctuate according to the success of a particular industry? Is the difference between oil (a commodity) and A.I. (not a commodity) relevant to the feasibility of this aspect of Yang's proposal? 

Thank you!"

This question has 2 parts. First one is how wide is a space of decisions, whether it's completely binary (accept/not accept agreement) or there is a set of points in between?

And second part is what decision represents common ground between positions of his supporters and opponents? Of course, if it's possible to find some compromise at all.

United States Healthcare as a Superior Good,"I recently was linked to [the following article](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/09/25/high-us-health-care-spending-is-quite-well-explained-by-its-high-material-standard-of-living/) which, although about a year old, makes the argument that the United States is actually not an outlier in Healthcare Expenditure per capita (HCE). The article seems pretty well backed up by data; the argument as best I understand it can be summarized as follows:

1. Healthcare is a superior good, namely a good where as wealth increases the proportion of that wealth spent on that good also increases. To whit; if wealth increases 10%, HCE tends to increase around 12 or 13%.
2. Many analyses of HCE involve comparisons to GDP, but this is misleading because GDP involves exports and government spending, which are not direct reflections of a populations' material wealth.
3. There are other, better measures of a populations' wealth and standards of living including Actual Individual Consumption (AIC).
4. When you plot HCE vs GDP and include more countries, especially those with more diverse economies, there are more outliers than just the United States. Plotting HCE vs AIC handles these countries much better.
5. If you look at HCE vs AIC plots over time, all countries gradually trend to spending more of their wealth in healthcare because (as in point 1) healthcare is a superior good.

The conclusion is essentially that, when you look at how materially wealthy the United States actually is, our spending is not an outlier. We spend a lot more because healthcare is a superior good and the the United States is a lot more wealthy and consumes a much greater volume of healthcare than other countries.

In addition, since healthcare is a labor-intensive good, it does not benefit from some of the same efficiencies of technology that other industries (such as manufacturing) might.

My first thought upon reading this article was to point out that even if it was true that our spending is roughly in line with what a sufficiently wealthy nation might expect, aren't our outcomes [much worse](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/oct/us-spends-more-on-health-care-than-other-nations)?

The same author has [another post](https://randomcriticalanalysis.wordpress.com/2016/11/06/us-life-expectancy-is-below-naive-expectations-mostly-because-it-economically-outperforms/) that I haven't read as thoroughly, but I believe he argues that our poor outcomes can be explained largely in part through [poor lifestyle choices](http://www.mtda.com/bu/tr00077E.pdf) and, paradoxically, the adverse effects material wealth can have on a populations' health. He makes the salient point that if our institutions were largely to blame for poor outcomes we might expect to see poor healthcare outcomes throughout the country (since our institutions don't differ all that much), but we don't see anything of the kind; our outcomes are highly regional; ultimately he centers the blame on smoking, obesity, low activity, and accident rates. I will note that he has some discussion of race that may make some readers uncomfortable; I am not familiar enough with the topic to know if he is making correct claims or if that part of the analysis is discriminatory and bogus.

All of the above seems at least plausible to me. 

But is it correct? How might this be reconciled with stories about how [hospital prices are in some sense made up](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html) and the actual price per procedure in the United States is often [hilariously different from other countries](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/072116/us-healthcare-costs-compared-other-countries.asp)? I haven't heard this sort of argument before and it is so at odds with conventional wisdom that I am very interested in discussion of whether or not it's actually accurate.

What independent evidence corroborates or refutes the allegations made via the recent James O'Keefe video?,"Conservative activist James O'Keefe [recently released a pair of videos](http://time.com/4536212/james-okeefe-project-veritas-video-democrats/) depicting conversations with a number of people depicted to hold various positions with the DNC and Democratic-affiliated SuperPacs.

The videos are used to indicate that the people recorded have organized and paid others to violently disrupt Donald Trump rallies, and to engage in voter fraud.

O'Keefe has a history of producing sensational videos, often sparking investigations which find that the videos [have been heavily and deceptively edited.](http://www.snopes.com/2016/10/18/project-veritas-election-videos/)

"McConnell says if Trump wins the nomination they will ""drop him like a hot rock,"" running negative ads to separate Trump from the Congressmen up for re-election. Would Trump stand a chance in the general if the Republican establishment essentially campaigns against him?","[This NYTimes article](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/donald-trump-republican-party.html) outlines the Republican leadership's game plan if Trump wins the nomination (and their lack of a game plan up until this point).

But the most interesting thing to me is what McConnell plans if Trump wins the nomination outright: they will ""run negative ads about Mr. Trump to create space between him and Republican senators seeking re-election.""  They will essentially try to convince voters that Trump will lose and will ""describe a Republican Senate to voters as a necessary check on a President Hillary Clinton.""

What powers are vested in the Chief Justice as the presiding judge in an impeachment trial?,"After a president is impeached by the House, the conviction trial takes place with the Senate acting as the jury and the Chief Justice of the United States acting as the judge. As [precedent](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/506/224/) indicates, impeachment is purely a political process and not a legal one. Therefore, the rules and procedures of a traditional trial that most people are most familiar with do not exactly apply in an impeachment trial.

In fact, according to the *[Rules and Procedures of Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials]( https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/3_1986SenatesImpeachmentRules.pdf)*, in an impeachment trial, the “Presiding Officer shall have power to make and issue… all orders, mandates, writs, and precepts authorized by these rules or by the Senate, and to make and enforce such other regulations and orders in the premises as the Senate may authorize or provide.” In other words, as the majority party of the Senate, the GOP appears to have the power to set the rules.

Furthermore, the rules also state (bold emphasis by me):

> And the Presiding Officer on the trial may rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy  of evidence and incidental questions, which ruling shall stand as the judgment of the Senate, **unless some Member of the Senate shall ask that a formal vote be taken thereon, in which case it shall be submitted to the Senate for decision without debate**; or he may at his option, in the first instance, submit any such question to a vote of the Members of the Senate. Upon all such questions the vote shall be taken in accordance with the Standing Rules of the Senate.

And thus it seems that the Chief Justice can be overridden in their rulings if a majority of the Senate votes on it.

So what exactly are the powers vested in the Chief Justice as the presiding judge in an impeachment trial?"

3. Is there a good idea on the total economic cost to China since travel restrictions were put in place? For example, an assessment of small businesses that might not re-open, such as restaurants and other stores without enough cash buffer to survive a prolonged shutdown?

4. As Wuhan gets back to work, and the rest of China gets back to normal, is there an economic stimulus plan being crafted for the country? What does it looks like?"
"Given the problem of widespread voter ignorance, could epistocracy produce better outcomes than democracy, and if so, should it be adopted?","I recently finished reading Jason Brennan's inflammatorily-titled book *[Against Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Democracy-Jason-Brennan/dp/0691162603/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472224252&sr=8-1&keywords=jason+brennan)*, in which he argues that most voters in democratic societies are too ignorant, biased, irrational, and/or misinformed to make policy judgment (or elect those who will) competently. In in [this post](http://blog.press.princeton.edu/2016/06/24/ethicist-jason-brennan-brexit-democracy-and-epistocracy/) on the Princeton University press blog, he summarizes the book's argument, saying:

> Political scientists have been studying voter knowledge for the past 60 years. The results are uniformly depressing. Most voters in most countries are systematically ignorant of even the most basic political facts, let alone more the social scientific theories needed to make sense of these facts.

For example, citizens generally don't know which party controls Congress (p. 25), they vastly overestimate how much of the federal budget is spent on foreign aid (p. 26); in 2000, fewer than half of Americans knew that Al Gore was more supportive of abortion rights and welfare state programs, favored a higher degree of aid to blacks, or was more supportive of environmental regulations. (p. 26) The basic problem, he says, is that individual voters' votes have so little chance of making a difference that most are not incentivized to be informed, unless they happen to find political knowledge interesting, feel they have a moral duty to be informed, or some other extenuating factor.

Democracy, Brennan argues, systematically violates the *competence principle*, ""which holds that high-stakes political decisions are presumed to be unjust, illegitimate, and lacking in authority if they are made incompetently or in bad faith, or by a generally incompetent decision-making body."" (p. 21) He likens much democratic decision-making to a doctor who writes you a prescription after consulting an Ouija board, and universal suffrage to indiscriminantly giving everyone a plumber's (or medical) license.

Brennan's proposed solution (or potential solution) is *epistocracy*, a system in which ""political power is to some degree apportioned according to knowledge."" An epistocracy makes some attempt to give more-informed citizens more political power (or give poorly-informed citizens less political power) in order to better abide by the competence principle. In the book he gives several examples of how this might work:

* **Restricted suffrage and plural voting**: Use some kind of voter qualification exam to identify which voters are more competent, and either disqualify the votes of poorly-informed voters or grant extra votes to well-informed voters.
* **Enfranchisement lottery**: Select a random, representative subset of citizens who will be able to earn the right to vote in the coming election by participating in a competence-building process.
* **Universal suffrage with epistocratic veto**: Similar to present democracies, except a formally epistocratic ruling body, open to all citizens able to meet competency or character-based requirements, is able to veto the decisions of the electorate, while these vetoes could be overridden by a supermajority vote. Brennan points out that we already have a body similar to this in the Supreme Court, which is a present-day example of an epistocratic council with veto power over decisions made by the electorate (or those they elect).
* **Government by simulated oracle**: By administering surveys that gauge peoples' political preferences, demographic characteristics, and basic objective political knowledge, we could simulate what would happen if they electorate's demographics remained unchanged, but everyone were well-informed, and then act according to this simulated electorate's will.

Brennan spends much of the book not arguing for epistocracy so much as for evaluating epistocracy on instrumental rather than procedural grounds. Democracy is to be preferred only it it produces a more just outcome, not because it is an intrinsically or uniquely just political process; he spends a few chapters addressing arguments to the contrary. He acknowledges that epistocracy in the real world is untested and will not be perfect, and will likely share many of democracy's flaws as well as some new ones, but argues that ""the interesting question is whether epistocracy, warts and all, would perform better than democracy, warts and all."" He thinks we have good reason to believe that it would.

The two most powerful arguments Brennan sees against epistocracy are 1) that it would likely award more political power to already-advantaged groups and/or take it away from disadvantaged ones (the demographic objection), and 2) that radically remaking social structures is dangerous given human imperfection (the conservative objection). In response to which Brennan points out 1) that the inequality causing some demographic groups to be disadvantaged and poorly-informed is a symptom of deeper issues that developed under democracy (and which epistocracy could potentially do a better job of addressing), and 2) that Edmund Burke initially raised the conservative objection in the 1790s regarding the French Revolution and in favor of monarchy, only to be subsequently proven wrong in the case of democracy.

Given the problem of voter ignorance Brennan highlights, could epistocracy produce better outcomes, and if so, should it be adopted, perhaps on some smaller scale initially? Or are there still compelling reasons to continue favoring democracy, ""warts and all""?

[The Insurrection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act) allows the president to deploy military troops within the United States to suppress civil disorder, insurrection, and rebellion, but the act states that unless military troops are requested by a state, the president cannot deploy troops by order unless it becomes ""impracticable to enforce federal laws through ordinary proceedings or if states are unable to safeguard its inhabitants' civil rights"".

Additionally, [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) further limits the president's powers to deploy military troops within the united states, although it does have a specific exclusion for the Insurrection Act.

Which leads me to wonder, what are the historical standards of invoking the Insurrection Act? What were the circumstances behind the invocation?

Has the Insurrection Act ever been invoked but later found to be in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act?"
Why did Republicans/pro-life supporters oppose Trump's comments about punishing women who get illegal abortions?,"Last week, Donald Trump received criticism for his statement about [punishing women who receive illegal abortions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/03/30/trump-if-abortions-were-banned-women-who-seek-them-would-face-punishment/?tid=a_inl). Criticism emerged from both [democrat and republican presidential candidates](http://www.people.com/article/donald-trump-abortion-backlash-hillary-clinton-ted-cruz).  

Cruz's criticism and the [concern from the Republican party](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/31/politics/trump-abortion-punishment-republicans-clinton/) seem to be at odds with the pro-life belief commonly held in the Republican party. If someone is pro-life, they believe life begins at conception. Wouldn't assisting in the taking of a life (with the help of a doctor) be akin to being an accomplice to murder? Why has the party focused on policies to punish doctors and not women who get abortions? It appears to be an ideological inconsistency in beliefs."

"What are the benefits and downsides of at-will employment laws, and what alternatives to this employment design are available?",">""Many people are surprised to learn, whether from an employment contract or employee handbook, that they are an ""at-will employee.""

I'm aware that other countries have different employment laws: 

* For example, Japan has very strict employee protections and employers are not allowed to terminate employees barring dire circumstances. [Source](https://www.dlapiper.com/~/media/Files/Other/2015/P1314_JanFeb2014_ELA.pdf).

* The United Kingdom also includes a certain level of employee protection, requiring a justifiable reason for dismissal. Most employees in the UK are based on formal contracts and all the permissible reasons for dismissing someone are laid out in the contract beforehand. Most of these contracts require prior notice before termination, and an employer will often need to show cause.

> Now the two sources have told BuzzFeed News that Cohen also told the special counsel that after the election, the president personally instructed him to lie — by claiming that negotiations ended months earlier than they actually did — in order to obscure Trump’s involvement.

> The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. Cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office.

What happened to household income in minority American families in the late 90s?,"A friend and I were looking at some data recently about household income, wealth distribution and poverty between ethnic groups in the United States over time.

The data seems to indicate something happened in the ~~mid-to-late 90s~~ early 2000s that caused a sharp dip in median household income among minority families, and an increase of minority families below the poverty line, but we were curious as to why that was the case.

[This Census visualization from '76 to '12](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-median-income-in-the-us-by-race-2013-9) shows a sudden drop in median household income among minorities around 2000. While white families experienced a very slight dip as well, all minority groups took a sudden and relatively deeper dive just ~~before~~ after the year 2000, and continued to drop through the next couple decades.

[Figure 2 on this page](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq3.htm#Figure 2) shows that the decline of blacks and Hispanics in poverty suddenly stopped and poverty of those groups began increasing again around the same time. Figure 3 on the same page shows the poverty rates among children in those groups, which is even more prominent.

Despite the amount of data, there's not a lot to go on for why the sudden shift. Typically when you see spikes/dives in large datasets like these, there's one or a small handful of factors that can be identified as causual.

What happened in the ~~late 90s~~ early 00s that would have contributed to this?

Edit: folks have pointed out the graph indicates a change in the early 2000s, not the late 90s. Should have put my glasses on!

Amazon put out a statement highlighting the pushback (in 3rd source):

> “A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward,’’ Amazon said in a statement.

I have a few questions trying to understand what was originally offered to Amazon, and what political actions were taken before they ultimately pulled out:

1: What specific incentives was Amazon set to receive for building its New York campus? Were the incentives Federal, State, or Local, and in what share?

2: In their decision not to build, Amazon makes reference to opposition by State and Local politicians. Specifically, what opposition are they talking about? Was there any legislative action in the works at either State or Local levels to change the terms that were offered to Amazon originally?

3: Amazon also states that with Local and State politicians they would not be able to ""...build the type of relationships that are required to go forward."" Beyond the initial $3 billion in incentives, has Amazon stated what type of additional support or help they would need from politicians, as this statement implies?

Sajid Javid defends deportation of grooming gang members,"

The UK Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, has defended the potential deportation of grooming gang members with dual-citizenship back to Pakistan, stripping them of their UK citizenship.

Has the UK or other countries deported criminals with dual citizenship? If they have, under what circumstances? Has something like the grooming gang scandal occurred elsewhere?

Some context on the grooming gang scandal:

[Child grooming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming) is befriending and establishing an emotional connection with a child, and sometimes the family, to lower the child's inhibitions with the objective of [sexual abuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse). Child grooming is also regularly used to lure minors into various illicit businesses such as [child trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour), [child prostitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_prostitution), or the production of [child pornography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography).

[The Rotherham scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), wherein around 1,400 children ages 11-16 were sexually abused primarily by British-Pakistani men, while the authorities failed to act.

[The Telford scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telford_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal), up to 1,000 children were abused in similar circumstances, with some murders as well."
What are some good resources I can use to educate myself about the causes and effects of various proposed political policies in the US?,"I feel like it's really easy to have political opinions. One might say ""I want to pay less taxes"" while another might say ""I want the government to pay for everyone to have healthcare"" and each would have their own reasons for holding those preferences. What I want to know is how can I educate myself on how all these different things would effect ""the big picture"" were they to happen? If we vote for lower taxes, how would that effect the way the government operates as we know it, what would we be giving up, etc? On the flip side, if we vote for socialized healthcare, how would that effect the economy with hundreds of insurance companies being forced out of business, millions of their employees becoming unemployed, etc. This may also have an effect on the salaries earned by healthcare providers, etc. I mean, it's one thing to say you want universal healthcare implemented in America. It's another thing to understand all of the causes and effects that would come about as a result.

When I vote, I want to be as informed as possible. I want to vote not just for what I *think* I want to happen, but policies that will actually have a positive effect on this country, our economy, and our overall well-being.

NOTE: the questions I outlined in my post are just examples and not things I am actually expecting you all to answer directly (although feel free to give it a try). What I am looking for is resources on how to best educate myself on all of the different policies, issues, etc that we vote on and how that will effect the big picture of life here in the US if certain policies were either implemented or eliminated. I hope that makes sense, let me know if you need me to further clarify."

1. Can we constitutionally introduce federal laws capping how much more CEO's can make than their employees? For example, a law that says CEO's can only make 10x or 50x more than the lowest earning employee? 

2. If we can, what are the possible drawbacks and benefits of this?

I'd also like to open this discussion up to the effects such a law or rule would have on the economy, if anyone's interested."

Article 2 of the constitution ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article\_Two\_of\_the\_United\_States\_Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution)) states the presidents duties but leaves some wiggle room by not setting specific times for some things.

Specifically, he lied about conversations he had with Kislyak, regarding Sanctions and about Israeli settlements:

> Flynn requested that Russia not retaliate against the punitive measures just imposed by the U.S., the court papers say. Flynn then called the transition official to report on his discussion. The following day, Russia announced that it would not take retaliatory measures against the U.S.

and

> Flynn also engaged in a similar back-and-forth with the Russian ambassador over a U.N. Security Council vote on a resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The incoming Trump administration opposed the resolution, and Flynn asked the Russian envoy to either oppose the measure or delay it. Flynn was directed by a ""very senior member"" of the transition team to make the request, court papers say.

Flynn ultimately pled guilty to the charges and made a statement afterwards, saying:

> ""My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the special counsel's office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions,""

"What effect, if any, has Trump's regulation strategy had on the increasing US emissions of 2018?"," I was doing some research on US progress on reducing emissions. From the [""Final US Emissions Estimates for 2018""](https://rhg.com/research/final-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) by Rhodium Group, 2018 saw a significant up-tick in US emissions from 2017 after 3 years of decrease. Increases were found in almost every sector: Transportation, Buildings, Power, Industry. Partial justifications for some of these increases include a colder winter--which offsets the energy savings of a cooler summer--and economic growth.

We've also seen [environmental regulations systematically removed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html) by the Trump administration. What effect do some of these regulations changes have on our emissions if any? Consider both \[1: Increased economic growth via reduced regulative burden\] and \[2: Increased emissions due to less stringent regulation\]

In addition, I noticed a curious discrepancy between the Rhodium Group's report and the EPA's reports. The EPA website only [provides data up to 2017](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2017) and an [EPA news report](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/latest-inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-shows-long-term-reductions) published in April, 2019 similarly provides insights only up to 2017. Rhodium group published their [Preliminary US Emissions Estimates for 2018](https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) in January, 2019. In the Rhodium report, they cite data from other independent sources--Bloomberg and Genscape--and other government agencies--EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) and the US Department of Transportation. Notably, the [EIA has already started publishing preliminary reports for 2019](https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/) and the [USDT has added data for 2018](https://www.bts.gov/topics/national-transportation-statistics) separately in each independent report throughout 2019.

It seems the Rhodium Group has published an analysis years earlier than a similar EPA report will be available. Why are they able to do this? Are there trade-offs in the scope or the quality of their analyses?"

To what degree does the United States' Senate represent the states as sovereign political entities?,"The United States' federal government is a [bicameral legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress) with a House of Representatives and Senate.  Before the [Seventeenth Amendment](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) was ratified in 1912, Senators weren't directly elected; instead, State legislatures appointed two Senators for six year terms each. George Mason, one of the original founders, argued that [""...state legislative solutions gave states the power of self-defense against the federal government.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii) Wendell Pierce held a different view, arguing that [""...the contrast between a state legislatively-appointed Senate and a popularly elected House would increase the types of interests represented in the federal government. By requiring the consent of two different constituencies in the House and the state legislatures in the Senate-- the composition of the Senate was seen as essential to the system of bicameralism, which would require 'the concurrence of two distinct bodies in schemes of usurpation or perfidy'.""](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xvii)

Contrast this with the German [Bundesrat](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/organisation-en/organisation-en-node.html). According to the [*German Basic Law (Article 51)](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Rather than two representatives with six year terms per person inhabiting the institution, the state governments send delegations of representatives that act in the will of the composition of that state, ensuring indirect majority-rule from the bottom-up. Each delegation receives votes based on the population of their state; [""Länder (State governments) with more than two million inhabitants shall have four, Länder with more than six million inhabitants five, and Länder with more than seven million inhabitants six votes.""](https://www.bundesrat.de/EN/funktionen-en/go-en/go-en-node.html) Most German states use some variation of proportional representation for their electoral systems, so representatives tend to represent more than [two political parties at once](https://www.bundesrat.de/SharedDocs/bilder/EN/artikel/zusammensetzung.jpg?__blob=panorama&v=23).  They're subject to [recall](http://www.senat.fr/senatsdumonde/english/germanyenglish.html) at any time by the state government, whereas U.S Senators [are not](https://www.dailysignal.com/2010/02/02/can-u-s-senators-be-recalled/).  


Is the German system of majority rule in both federal legislative houses conducive to people's liberty or detrimental to the long-term liberty of the people? Does it represent everyone or is it failing in protecting minorities? By and large, do U.S Senators succeed or fail to represent their state, and if they fail, does the German system offer a means by which to achieve success?  Is it possible to reconcile gerrymandering and the two-party system with fair representation in government alongside the goal of Senators to represent the entirety of their state in the federal legislature?

How does one define the representation of a state:  If its the government, does that mean the entire legislative branch of a state is represented or merely the majority?  If it's the people, then does that include everyone, or the constituents who voted for said U.S Senators?

Additionally there are startups such as Jeff Bezos' [Blue Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin) have sought to enter the field and developed significant components such as their own new engine.

On the government side, NASA is working in-house on the [Space Launch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) which in early phases is designed to be approximately equivalent to the Falcon Heavy's expendable payload capacity, and in later phases to approximately match the Saturn V.

The SLS also [has been plagued by cost issues and may be very expensive to fly, as a fully expendable vehicle.](https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/08/how-much-will-sls-and-orion-cost-to-fly-finally-some-answers/)

As a competitor to the SLS, SpaceX has proposed [the BFR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BFR_(rocket\)), which would be a fully reusable heavy lift system.  They claim to [want to test it next year.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a16672538/spacex-testing-new-rocket-bfr-next-year/) But SpaceX is known for... aggressive schedule predictions.  [The Falcon Heavy has been delayed 5 years.](https://www.newsy.com/stories/spacex-launches-falcon-heavy-5-years-later-than-planned/)

So with all of that said: What are the pros and cons of governments outsourcing launch capability to private firms?  Do they present a major cost saving opportunity?  An avenue for corruption?  Are there national security perils in outsourcing?  What have been notable successes and failures of such outsourcing?  "
[META] r/NeutralPolitics announcements,"Hello r/NeutralPolitics users,

We have a few things to announce:

* After a long hiatus, our news subreddit, r/NeutralNews, has just relaunched. See the [announcement here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/hi25c6/meta_rneutralnews_has_relaunched/)
* We're going to be launching a new subreddit for fact checking soon. Submission Rule E in r/NeutralPolitics prohibits requests for fact checking, so when we'd get submissions in that format, we would often refer them to r/politicalfactchecking. Unfortunately, that subreddit [recently shut down,](https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/gb8987/a_message_to_all_users_of_rpoliticalfactchecking/) so we decided to create our own and we'd like your feedback on how it should run. Please visit r/NeutralFactChecking to join the discussion about our new venture.
* We're planning to rework /r/NeutralTalk (again) to make it more useful and popular. There's a [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralTalk/comments/hi2ege/meta_proposals_to_reform_rneutraltalk/) over there if you want to comment and shape what it will become.
* We removed a line from our sidebar that read: ""Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content."" This line had already been removed from the guidelines, but it got inadvertently left in the sidebar text about neutrality. It was causing confusion, so we eliminated it.

Cheers!

Who breaks a tie vote in the Senate on procedural questions during the impeachment trial of the President?,"I am specifically asking about what happens on procedural questions during the trial (e.g. calling witnesses) if the Senate is tied 50/50 on those questions.  Conviction and removal is a 2/3 threshold where it doesn't matter.

The [US Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei) provides that:

>The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but
shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.

And that:

>The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for
that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the
United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside

So the Vice President is established as the President of the Senate, but the Constitution specifies that when the President is tried in an impeachment, the Chief Justice ""shall preside.""

Does the power of voting when the Senate is equally divided reside solely in the Vice President, or would it reside in the Chief Justice as presiding officer for the impeachment trial?  Or neither? Is a 50/50 vote just a failed vote when the Vice President cannot preside because the Chief Justice must be presiding?"
Global water scarcity: How big a problem is it? What policies are effective at ameliorating it?,"Concerns have arisen that [""the world may be running out of fresh water""](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170412-is-the-world-running-out-of-fresh-water). Growing populations, along with growing agricultural water usage (which already makes up [80% of used US fresh water](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use/)) and supply issues [stemming from global warming](http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-effects/water-supply.html). Overall, demand is expected to increase 50% globally between 2000 and 2050, [mainly](http://www.globalwaterforum.org/2012/05/21/water-outlook-to-2050-the-oecd-calls-for-early-and-strategic-action/) from manufacturing but from domestic and commercial sources as well.

Some regions have already been swamped by water problems: the American state of California has been going through [record drought conditions](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/californias-drought/) in recent years, while Australia endured a nearly [decade-long drought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_Australian_drought) at the beginning of the millenium. Additionally,many areas that were historically densely populated have been enduring [desertification](http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.355.aspx.pdf), in some cases a long term trend exacerbated by human exploitation and climate change. This in turn has threatened existing populations, and at least some scholars believe that desertification may be a [long term cause](http://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/climate-change-conflict-mena) of chronic conflict in regions like the Middle East. 

Many regions have already begun demand-side policies to address the issue: for example, has managed to reduce aggregate residential water use [by half](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-australia-can-teach-the-world-about-surviving-drought/) since their great drought. Other nations have addressed the supply side, some [turning to desalination](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/israel-proves-the-desalination-era-is-here/) while others have engaged in massive [water transfer schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project) from more to less wet parts of their nation. 

Water scarcity seems to be [especially acute](https://publish.illinois.edu/sswpolicy/2015/09/18/the-water-scarcity-in-developing-countries-effects-on-women-and-children/) in developing nations unable to afford many solutions developed nations have implemented. This combined with massively growing populations in these regions suggests that problems may soon emerge.

"Is there legal precedent for Mueller's team behaviour regarding Concord Management's defence, and it is revealing of underlying issues with his legal case against them?","Over the past few days there has been a developing story regarding Concord Management's response to Mueller's indictments. 

For a refresh, Concord Management was one of the principal entities involved in Mueller's original indictment [source](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1035562/download). This is the entity run by ""Putin's chef"", Yevgeny Prigozhin, allegedly operating ""Russian troll farms"" to explicitly interfere in the United States 2016 election. A CNN expose [here](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/17/politics/russian-oligarch-putin-chef-troll-factory/index.html)

I would have thought this entity would have one of the strongest cases regarding the evidence in the indictment.

The developing story over the last few days is that the Concord Management legal team seems to be fighting back [source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-04/russian-company-s-lawyer-plays-hardball-in-mueller-investigation) and Mueller's team have requested delays [source](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000163-2d3b-d9b5-af73-ffff51b70001) - some legal commentary is pointing to these issues as revealing the case isn't as strong as believed [source](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/is-robert-muellers-russian-troll-farm-indictment-falling-apart/).

Does the current behaviour of Mueller's legal team reveal potential programs? Is the behaviour expected in such legal cases? Specifically regarding delaying discovery over the technicalities of receiving a subpoena?"
To What Extent is the CDC Restricted From Studying Gun Violence?,"Considering the recent mass shootings, there has been plenty of support for gun control legislation in Congress. One of the things I've been seeing is people angry that the CDC is prevented from conducting research on gun control.  

On one side, I see people talking about how the Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC  from working on this research, and how spending bills don't allocate any budget for this area.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/10/04/gun-violence-research-has-been-shut-down-for-20-years/?utm_term=.c1727747b749

On the other side, I see pro-gun people talking about how the CDC actually is able to conduct gun control research, and has done so.

So where is this disagreement coming from?"
"Up to today, what characteristics do countries with effective COVID-19 containment strategies have versus those that have struggled?","This is obviously difficult to nail down completely empirically, as some countries like South Korea [did mass testing of the population](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-south-korea-italy-mass-testing-covid19-will-keep-spreading/), finding many asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus. Many places may have had [people who had the disease](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/have-i-already-had-coronavirus-how-would-i-know) earlier but were never identified as positive. Also many countries have perhaps engaged in practices to avoid the stigma of high death counts. Previous cases of death from influenza and pneumonia are now [perhaps undiagnosed COVID-19](https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/04/cdc-launches-studies-to-get-more-precise-count-of-undetected-covid-19-cases/) cases.
And obviously, inequality plays a role in the numbers. Countries with low testing capacity will have low numbers of formally identified cases, but that does not mean low levels of COVID-19 cases and coronavirus characters.

But, to this point (rather than speculating about the future), what empirically has worked in reducing cases and deaths? New Zealand has [five million people and about a thousand cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/erinspencer1/2020/04/10/new-zealands-pm-is-leading-a-masterclass-on-coronavirus-response/#5883ea865793), but deaths are in the single digits. Taiwan's response to coronavirus has been so competent that there are now [calls for it to join the WHO](https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-coronavirus-success-bolsters-case-150420811.html), which like many international bodies it is not a member due to the ongoing One China dispute with Mainland China.  

The U.S, Italy, France, and Spain have all had huge issues keeping cases below the capacity of the healthcare system. According to [one projection of the US](https://covidactnow.org/), many states and counties are at risk of overwhelming hospitals within the next month or two, unless social distancing and stay at home measures are more rigorously enforced. Italy faced issues with an aging population and an abnormally high death rate.

A final factor is the issue of second waves and the return of the infection given that international travel will eventually begin to open again. Singapore, which isolated and avoided community transmission, [now has new clusters](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/09/world/asia/coronavirus-hong-kong-singapore-taiwan.html) due to travelers who were not identified as having the virus. That article also gives another opinion on Taiwan's efforts, showing the importance of looking at containment as something that takes months, rather than a few weeks. COVID-19 can take a while to kill after initial infection, with recovery taking weeks if not months. Here is an [excerpt from an NPR story on it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/14/805289669/how-covid-19-kills-the-new-coronavirus-disease-can-take-a-deadly-turn):

> The most severe cases — about 6% of patients — end up in intensive care with multi-organ failure, respiratory failure and septic shock, according to a February report from the WHO. And many hospitalized patients require supplemental oxygen. In extreme cases, they need mechanical ventilation — including the use of a sophisticated technology known as ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), which basically acts as the patient's lungs, adding oxygen to their blood and removing carbon dioxide. The technology ""allows us to save more severe patients,"" Dr. Sylvie Briand, director of the WHO's pandemic and epidemic diseases department, said at a press conference In February.
> 
> Many of the more serious cases have been in people who are middle-aged and elderly — Furuya notes that our immune system gets weaker as we age. She says for long-term smokers, it could be even worse because their airways and lungs are more vulnerable. People with other underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or chronic lung disease, have also proved most vulnerable. Furuya says those kinds of conditions can make it harder for the body to recover from infections.
> 
> ""Of course, you have outliers — people who are young and otherwise previously healthy who are dying,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NPR's 1A show. ""But if you look at the vast majority of the people who have serious disease and who will ultimately die, they are in that group that are either elderly and/or have underlying conditions.""
> 
> Estimates for the case fatality rate for COVID-19 vary depending on the country. But data from both China and Lombardy, Italy, show the fatality rate starts rising for people in their 60s. In Lombardy, for instance, the case fatality rate for those in their 60s is nearly 3 percent. It's nearly 10 percent for people in their 70s and more than 16 percent for those in their 80s.

So, what has worked, what has not?"
What has been causing increased political polarization within the United States?,"[There has been a measurable increase in the growing political divide](http://www.people-press.org/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/) within the United States today.

"
"[META] Announcing new, more detailed rules guidance.","After having some issues recently relating to clarity of the rules, we have decided to make a substantial revamp of our rules wiki and adopt detailed explanations for each rule, giving examples and additional information for almost every aspect of them.

None of these explanations are changes to the rules, but they should hopefully codify how we have come to interpret and enforce them over time, and make it easier for users to understand where we're coming from.

---

#Submission rules

A) **Ask a specific political question.** We do not allow overly broad questions, solicitations of pure opinion, surveys, [requests to explain public opinion or media coverage,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/209fox/meta_the_np_community_cannot_explain_public/) posts about other subreddits, or meta posts.
 
 * NeutralPolitics is principally focused on questions of policy and governance.  Analyzing things like media coverage, public opinion and the like are outside of our wheelhouse.
 * A solicitation of pure opinion is a question which can't be answered with facts people could source.

 * For example ""should healthcare be a legal right?"" is a pure opinion question, whereas ""what have been successful and unsuccessful attempts to legally establish positive rights?"" is a question people can answer with facts about what has been done in the past.

 * Questions about ""why"" people do things often run afoul of rule A.  It's very hard to answer a question about motivations with facts, since it's asking our users to read minds.  It's better to ask things like what the stated reasons for a political action are, or who stands to benefit or be harmed by the action.

B) **Frame it in a neutral way.** The post must not be inflammatory, editorialized, leading towards a particular answer, a statement of opinion, or a request to critique your theory.

 * This rule can be tricky to follow, but we've written up some detailed tips [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/)

 * Try to give all sides of a question.  If it's an ongoing issue of debate, link to articles which give multiple perspectives on the question.

 * Do not state things which are highly debated as unequivocally true.  Say (and link) who is asserting their truth and let the source do the arguing in their own name.

 * **Do not answer your own question!** A post which tries to answer the headline question is inherently going to break rule B.

 * Avoid negative framing.* 

  * Instead of asking ""Why don't we do [X policy]?""  ask, What are the pros and cons of [X policy]?""

  * Instead of ""Why doesn't [X politician] do Y?"" ask ""What are the precedents for [an office-holder/candidate] doing Y?""

C) **Outline the issue well.** Give more than just a headline. Provide some background information.

 * This rule is fairly straightforward, but basically it means you should provide enough information so that people understand the context for the question.  News articles or research articles on the subject matter should also be included so there is more background people can read before answering.

D) **Provide sources.** Statements of fact must cite [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Nothing is ""common knowledge."" **Submissions that do not include sources will be rejected.** (Sole exception: if you cannot find specific information after a thorough online search, you may post a request for sources.)

* This rule ensures that submissions are based on factual claims with some outside basis, not just the impressions of the asker.

* If you ""heard"" something, source it.

 * If something is being talked about a lot, it should be easy to find articles talking about it. If you want, you can even modmail us and ask for help with your post. Most of us are news or policy junkies and probably can help you find some good sources.

* Don't attribute a statement to an general group. Name a person who said the thing.

 * Another big issue we get is things like ""people on the right/the left/republicans/democrats/the media"" have been saying X. Often X is an inflammatory/strawman argument.

 * Like things you ""heard about,"" this will not do. NeutralPolitics doesn't do blind quotes. Find an opinion article or something with a named person making that argument. For example:

  * **Bad** ""[X party] has been saying that [Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls.

  * **Good** [Person A], a [X party] member of Congress, said ""[Y policy] has been really popular despite the polls."" [link to source]

* We are much stricter with sources for submissions than for comments.  Please see the [source guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) for more information.

* Requests for sources are rarely allowed, and only when a subject is not easily searched on the internet after substantial effort.  We are not ELI5 or another subreddit for casual questions.  If you are considering such a submission, we strongly suggest [sending us a modmail first.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics&subject=Request%20for%20Sources%20Post&message=)

E) **Propose a good starting point for discussion.** The purpose of this forum is to discuss issues. We do not allow polls, surveys or requests for fact checking.

* This is a close corollary of rule A.  But the gist of it is that we are looking for questions which our users can answer with Reddit comments.

* We are especially strict about this rule when it comes to promoting anything of your own.  We will categorically reject any submission which includes a link to any article or video or other thing which you are the author or creator of.

F) **Title the post accurately.** The title must match the contents.

G) **No requests for speculation.** If the question cannot be answered with facts — which includes any that are phrased in the future tense (What will/would/could happen?) — then it's not appropriate for NeutralPolitics.

* NeutralPolitics is a fact based forum, and questions which ask to predict the future necessarily ask for things which can't be answered with facts.

* Try rephrasing the question to ask what has happened in similar past cases.

* We also prohibit in this category questions whose answer cannot be provided by any user. (e.g. what are the nuclear launch codes; what are the contents of a sealed court case).

* As mentioned with rule A, ""Why"" questions often violate rule G.  They ask our users to speculate about the contents of a person's mind, as opposed to something answerable with facts.


---

#Comment Rules

1) **Be courteous.** Demeaning language, sarcasm, rudeness or hostility towards another user will get your comment removed. Repeated violations may result in a ban.

* Our commitment to civil discourse is one of the core principles of NeutralPolitics, and we do not make any exceptions from this rule.

* Any language which a reasonable observer would conclude disparages another user in any way is considered a violation of this rule.  Even if you did not intend that.

* **""But it was true"" is not a defense.**  Accusing another user of something is prohibited, even if you believe that accusation to be true.

* **""They started it"" is not a defense.**  If another user breaks the rules, please report the comment.  Replying with a rule violating comment of your own will just get both of them removed and makes that much more work for the mod team.

2) **Source your facts.** If you're claiming something to be true, you need to back it up with a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) There is no ""common knowledge"" exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

* This rule is the core of our commitment to fact-based discourse.

* We do not allow claims of expertise or anecdotal evidence to substitute for providing sources.

* We do not allow image sources because they are too easy to manipulate and there's no good way to verify they come from where they purport to.

* We do not allow video sources unless accompanied by text sources because they are too hard for us to moderate and it is unreasonable to ask people to watch a video to check what you're claiming is true.

* Phrasing a statement of fact in the form of a question (""Isn't it true that [X]?"") will be treated as a statement that [X] is true, and needs a source.

* Stating it is your opinion that something is true does not absolve the necessity of sourcing that claim.

* For more detail, read our section on [qualified sources.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources)

3) **Be substantive.** NeutralPolitics is a serious discussion-based subreddit. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, off topic replies, or pejorative name calling.

* A NeutralPolitics comment should not just be a general a reaction to the subject matter of the post, but should try to advance a substantive point of some sort backed up by evidence.

* Joke and meme comments are prohibited as not further advancing a productive conversation.

* One-liner comments are prohibited because we want to foster detailed and substantive discussion, and it harms that when people don't put effort into what they're saying.

* Off topic replies are prohibited.  We curate the types of questions we allow under rule A for a reason.

* [Pejorative name calling](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7mn3a5/meta_announcing_a_revised_rule_3_and_a_request/) means any use of a demeaning name to describe a person or group when it's not accompanied by a sourced explanation of why the name is literally accurate.


4) **Address the arguments, not the person.** The subject of your sentence should be ""the evidence"" or ""this source"" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation. ""You"" statements are suspect.

* As a part of our commitment to a fact-based discussion, we find that comments which try to go to people's personal motivations or personal conduct are detrimental to our subreddit.

* The subject of discussion on NP is never the conduct or motives of another user, but is always about the substance of what people are saying.  Comments which get personal, even if not directly accusatory or rude, are something which take conversations off topic, and so are banned here.

* The purpose of a discussion is also not to prove another user wrong about something, but rather to inform all readers by using evidence to demonstrate the facts about something."
What are the legal merits of the President's proposal to implement a transgendered ban?,"On August 25, 2017, President Trump signed a [Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/08/25/presidential-memorandum-secretary-defense-and-secretary-homeland) detailing his plain to prohibit transgendered persons in the US military. What are the legal merits of this proposal?

What are the pros and cons of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's approach to education reform?,"I’ve been hearing a lot about Trump’s pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, some of it bad and some of it good. [It seems pretty clear that]( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos) she strongly supports “school choice” – in other words, she is a supporter of scholarship tax credits, vouchers, education savings accounts, and charter schools.
I’ve seen hefty criticism of her approach to public education, and I’ve also seen some praise, as well as some sources that [give a pretty even rundown of both sides of the debate]( http://www.balancedpolitics.org/school_vouchers.htm). [According to what I’ve been able to find] ( http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/interview_with_betsy_devos), the pros of her approach are:

- It will encourage more innovation in schools, helping to move our stagnated public education system forward by creating competition.

- It will give poor families the same opportunity to choose their kids’ education as rich families have.

- Those who attend private schools generally have [higher SAT scores]( http://www.capenet.org/pdf/Outlook399.pdf) than those who attend public schools. However, [others]( http://www.greatschools.org/gk/articles/comparing-private-public-school-test-scores/) say that once you apply a standardized test such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and adjust it for socioeconomic factors, there is little to no difference between the scores of public and private schools.

- Private schools allow students to attain a greater depth in subjects that interest them.

- Private schools are more effective than public schools at managing their money.

The cons, on the other hand, are:

- Vouchers drain funds from public schools.

- Private schools aren’t monitored as closely as public schools; therefore, there is a risk that some may not provide a fair, balanced, or responsible education.

- Whereas public schools are open to everyone, private schools can discriminate based on a variety of factors. However, I would personally argue that public schools also discriminate in a way, based on income – because public school funding is tied to property values, [lower-income families tend to be stuck with lower-quality schools]( http://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem).

- Some, such as the [NY Times]( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/betsy-devos-and-the-wrong-way-to-fix-schools.html), cite her track record as an example of what will happen if she implements her policies as Secretary of Education. However, the Times also acknowledges that this doesn’t automatically discount the potential of charter schools, citing their success in New Orleans, where rigorous oversight from local leaders ensures that the schools don’t discriminate.

So I’m curious to know your guys’ take on this. What are the pros and cons of her approach to education, and do you think it would ultimately help or hurt the country?

On one hand, some people aren't able to live off of minimum wage when working full time: https://livingwage.mit.edu/states/06 (This of course is dependent on location. Switch to, say, Wyoming and it might look different.) In addition, an increased minimum wage would supposedly require very little increase in prices and/or decrease in profit taking (a 10% increase in minimum wage is correlated with a 0.3% increase in CPI, see page 3): https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2017/the-local-aggregate-effects-of-minimum-wage-increases.aspx#:~:text=Abstract,outcomes%20besides%20employment%20and%20wages.&text=minimum-wage%20workers.-,Increases%20in%20minimum%20wages%20also%20lower%20debt%20among%20households%20with,to%20increase%20access%20to%20credit.

On the other hand, small businesses get hurt more than franchises: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027843191830968X It seems reasonable to assume that most people would not accept a job that would not provide for them sufficiently (page 6): https://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/working_papers/working_papers_51-100/WP61.pdf And finally, many people in minimum wage jobs simply view it as a temporary gig or a stepping stone on the way to something better: https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2017/home.htm

What other pros/cons do you see and which position makes the most sense overall?"
"Should prostitution be legal, illegal, or decriminalized in the west?","[As it stands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_by_region), most of the west handles prostitution with some degree of prohibition or criminalization, whether it be on purchasers, sex workers, related acts (running a brothel, pimping, etc.), or all three. While some nations like the Netherlands and Germany have fully legalized the industry, restriction is still the status quo.

Associated with this issue are a wide array of problems and questions, such as human trafficking, the role of the state, the morality of the act of prostitution itself, the freedom and health of women involved, and so on. Many support full legalization, for reasons that typically include minimizing harm, promoting health and safety, and eliminating non-violent/victimless crimes ([example](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-raphael/legalize-prostitution_1_b_4251956.html)). Others support continued criminalization or restriction on the basis of traditional moral rejection of prostitution. Other still support continued criminalization for buyers because they view the industry and inherently predatory and abusive, and fear legalization would expand it and increase instances of things like sex trafficking ([example](https://nordicmodelnow.org)).

How should prostitution be handled in the west?"
Is Quebec Bill 62 constitutional?,"Quebec's National Assembly voted [today](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-niqab-burka-bill-62-1.4360121) to pass [Bill 62](http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-62-41-1.html) which requires that persons receiving services from Quebec government personnel must have their face uncovered.  The law allows accommodations only on the following grounds.

>A personnel member of a body who deals with a request for an
accommodation on religious grounds must make sure that

>(1) the accommodation request results from the application of section 10
of the Charter of human rights and freedoms (chapter C-12);

>(2) the accommodation requested is consistent with the right for equality

>(3) the accommodation requested does not compromise the principle of
State religious neutrality.

>The accommodation must be reasonable in that it must not impose undue

involved.

>An accommodation may be granted only if the person making the request

Does the Minimum Wage Hurt Low-Income Workers?,"A [study](https://evans.uw.edu/sites/default/files/NBER%20Working%20Paper.pdf) released 6/26/17 from the University of Washington revealed the following about the results of the Seattle minimum wage increase:

> Using a variety of methods to analyze employment in
all sectors paying below a specified real hourly rate, we conclude that the second wage increase
to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by around 9 percent, while hourly wages in such
jobs increased by around 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll fell for such jobs, implying that the minimum wage ordinance lowered low-wage employees’ earnings by an average of $125 per month in 2016

A $1500 annual reduction (or 6.6%) in pay for someone making ~~minimum wage~~ less than $19/hour seems like a big hit. Did this policy end up hurting a demographic of society that it was intended to help?

Here are additional commentaries on the study.

[538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/seattles-minimum-wage-hike-may-have-gone-too-far/) commented on the advantage of the level of detail the data they used had:

>The Washington study has one big advantage over most past research: The authors had access to detailed data on the hours and earnings of nearly all employees in Washington state, allowing them to measure the effects of the minimum wage much more directly than is possible with less complete datasets.

[Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/business/uw-study-finds-seattles-minimum-wage-is-costing-jobs/) mentioned a quote from one of the researchers who conducted the study:

>“If you’re a low-skilled worker with one of those jobs, $125 a month is a sizable amount of money,” said Mark Long, a UW public-policy professor and one of the authors of the report. “It can be the difference between being able to pay your rent and not being able to pay your rent.”

>The report also estimated that there are about 5,000 fewer low-wage jobs in the city than there would have been without the law."

Is drug legalization/decriminalization sound policy?,"California, America's largest state, recently [legalized the recreational use and sale of cannabis](http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-election-day-2016-proposition-64-marijuana-1478281845-htmlstory.html), joining seven other states as American public opinion [moves in favor](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/12/support-for-marijuana-legalization-continues-to-rise/) of full, national legalization. 

The US and much of the rest of the world have historically cooperated via a [series of international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Convention_on_Narcotic_Drugs) to outlaw many recreational drugs, including cannabis, LSD, cocaine and so on. Recent trends in cannabis in the United States and [other nations](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/global-marijuana-cannabis-laws/) have thrown this old equilibrium into question. On top of this, some nations like Portugal have [experimented with](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/?utm_term=.1d839e2c929c) decriminalizing all recreational drugs, including ""hard drugs"". 

The connection between narcotic prohibition and crime has long been noted, especially with regards to [terrorists in Afghanistan](http://www.opium.org/how-does-opium-fund-terrorism.html) and [cartels in Mexico](http://www.businessinsider.com/mexican-cartel-guide-2015-12). Additionally, some have pointed out that many currently illegal drugs are [generally less dangerous](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/11/drugs_cause_most_harm) than legal ones like alcohol and tobacco. However, many currently prohibited drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, are [highly addictive](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/understanding-drug-use-addiction) and have [significant negative health effects](https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/commonly-abused-drugs-charts), perhaps justifying prohibition. 

Is decriminalization and legalization of such recreational drugs sound policy? What positive effects does it have, and what are its drawbacks? Should a line be drawn on legalization between ""hard"" and ""soft"" drugs? Do nations experimenting with such policy run any legal risks as a result of the UN drug conventions they have signed?"
How prevalent are secular/Atheist Conservatives? What are the reasons underlying their political persuasion?,"Speaking personally, I am a non-religious Democrat, and I would say that my lack of religiosity at least somewhat influences my views on social issues. I did, however, grow up in a religious household and was a Republican by age eighteen. I've changed a lot since then, but at that time, my views on social issues were very much influenced by my religious beliefs.

So that leads me to wonder, what are the motivating factors in an Atheist or secular individual gravitating towards a Conservative/Republican worldview?

If right-leaning stances on social issues are not in any way influenced by religion, then what would be the reasoning behind, say, being against same-sex marriage or being pro-life? (I know these are the obvious hot-button issues, I'm just using them as easy examples)

Maybe their secular Conservatism generally has more of a basis in a single issue such as Economics or Gun rights?

Surely there must be some folks who self-identify this way and can offer some insight? I would just like to understand more about this as it fascinates me.

EDIT:  [Here is an article from Gallup including a statistic indicating that Conservatives generally skew towards a religious disposition.](http://www.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/182210/highly-religious-conservative-republicans.aspx)"
[META] New ban policy,"**This is not an April Fools joke!**

It's a point of pride for the mod team here that we've banned very few users over the history of this subreddit. Given the topics we deal with, and the volatile environment created by online anonymity, you might expect that we issue frequent bans, but we've found that we can usually avoid them by directly engaging the users. We've had users who started off combative or flaunting the rules, but after numerous discussions and warnings from the mods, turned into valuable contributors.

We would like to continue that approach, but the fact is, it's not sustainable. 

First, it takes too much time. Frequent exchanges with a single user, who may post 5-10 comments a day that draw reports, are a drain on the whole mod team and they take us away from other important business. It's far easier to simply ban that user and end up with 5-10 fewer reports a day to investigate. We have always resisted that easy route, but with our current levels of traffic that has to change.

Second, as the election has gotten steam, electoral politics has become dominant over policy in many NeutralPolitics discussions. We've had a number of problematic interactions with users whose primary purpose for being on NP is to promote or denigrate particular candidates, and the heightened passions are showing the inadequacies of our prior policy on bans.

As has always been the case, multiple violations of the rules will draw a ban warning. However, from today forward, **users who respond inappropriately to the ban warning, either by failing to adjust the offending behavior or by being combative with the mods, will be banned immediately.** At the moderators' discretion, that ban may or may not be permanent.

For clarity, our internal policy around banning a user is as follows: A ban is proposed to the full mod team by a specific mod with the reasoning stated. The team then votes on the proposal. The motion carries if a simple majority of all mods who participate are in favor, and that majority must include one of the two most senior mods.

What are the arguments for and against gerrymandering?,"[Gerrymandering](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gerrymander) is the practice of redrawing congressional districts to suit a specific party. The dictionary definition (which is what is linked above), describes it as ""the dividing of a state, county, etc., into election districts so as to give one political party a majority in many districts while concentrating the voting strength of the other party into as few districts as possible"". 

While both parties have engaged in it, the current view seems to be that the Republican party benefits more, with some data on the topic coming from [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/partisan-gerrymandering-has-benefited-republicans-more-than-democrats-2017-6). Gerrymandering leads to lovely looking congressional maps, such as [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district) in Chicago.

I'm interested in the reasons why someone, regardless of political viewpoint, would be for or against this practice. Additionally, what are the pros and cons of various proposed methods of fixing it (if one thinks it needs to be fixed)?"
GOP Tax Bill and Tuition Waivers,"One thing that's been cropping up in the news quite a bit recently is the impact that the new GOP Tax Bill ([the one passed by the House](https://waysandmeansforms.house.gov/uploadedfiles/bill_text.pdf)) would have on tuition waivers. I've seen quite a bit of reporting (see [here](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/14/563879136/house-gop-tax-plan-would-hit-grad-students-with-massive-tax-hike) and [here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/opinion/house-tax-bill-graduate-students.html?_r=0&referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), for instance) that the new tax plan turns tuition waivers into taxable income, drastically increasing the tax burden for graduate students based on money that they don't even get.

I'm a graduate student myself (in a STEM field), so this topic is of some personal importance to me. However, I have yet to find a news article that details exactly how this is supposed to work. The NYT opinion piece quoted above references that the bill repeals Section 117(d)(5) of the tax code, but that's as specific as I've seen journalists get. It's rare (read: nonexistant) for such pieces to quote directly from the bill or the tax code and no attempt at real legal analysis is ever made.

I call attention to this fact because there was some good discussion on /r/gradschool recently about this bill and there was one (heavily downvoted) user who was unsure that the tax bill would actually have this result. I found [this analysis](https://surlysubgroup.com/2017/11/06/gop-raises-taxes-on-graduate-students-or-does-it/) by a professor at Notre Dame Law School who goes into some detail as to how the bill and tax code interact and he seems similarly unsure. To quote:

> According to Dr. Wilke, the GOP tax bill now requires those tuition waivers to be included in income. After studying the bill and the current statute, this appeared to be true. So, I ran the numbers for a typical graduate student at my institution. You can read my in-depth calculation in the Twitter thread. But essentially, of the $23,000 stipend that a single Notre Dame student receives, he or she would need to pay approximately $13,350 in federal and state income tax, compared with about $2,500 under current law. That makes a graduate education effectively unaffordable.

> Perhaps I’m naïve, but I have trouble believing that the GOP really intends to take away such a large, important benefit from a huge number of students, whose work is critically important to the betterment of this country. Could the GOP have meant only to target the other provisions in section 117(d), which exclude undergraduate tuition waivers from taxation for employees of a university? Are there remaining provisions in the Code that could save the tuition waiver’s tax-free nature? Let’s take a closer look at the proposal.

He goes into some detail in his analysis, but ... it's complicated. I'm not sure I have understood him well enough to summarize accurately, and so I encourage you to simply read his article.

Does anyone here have any insight as to what exactly is going on with Section 1204(a)(3) and how exactly tuition waivers are handled under Section 117 of the [tax code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/117)? I have found mainstream journalism to be incredibly unhelpful in this regard.

Thank you for reading!"
What are the pros and cons of the US Government approving the AT&T/Time Warner merger?,"The acquisition would give AT&T significant holdings in the media industry to go along with its ownership of television and internet providers.

"Firms like Uber classify drivers as contractors, rather than as employees. Is this business structure legally legitimate, or merely an attempt to get around employment laws?","Uber, the massive ridesharing company with a current valuation [greater than that of GM]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2015/12/04/at-68-billion-valuation-uber-will-be-bigger-than-gm-ford-and-honda/#574856a55858), has grown by adopting a rather unique business model. Whereas a traditional firm hires employees to do its work, Uber claims to be a networking service, connecting customers with independent contractors within its network. Following this model, Uber has [grown massively](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0822-uber-revenue-20150822-story.html) in the last several years.

However, widespread opposition to the Uber business model has grown simultaneously. While some applaud Uber for [lowering prices for consumers]( http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/08/uber-lowers-fares-in-over-100-cities/) by bypassing the artificial constraint on supply created by [taxi medallions]( https://www.thestreet.com/story/13385263/1/the-one-chart-that-should-worry-uber-and-hurts-the-taxi-medallion-short-selling-thesis.html), others have questioned the source of its success. In particular, [some claim that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) far from improving general economic efficiency and social welfare, Uber has become so successful by effectively shifting the burden of many employment costs from themselves to their “contractors”. In the US, as in many other nations, workers are entitled to [a wide number of workplace rights]( https://www.dol.gov/dol/rights-benefits.htm), including mandated breaks, the right to unionize, provision of healthcare benefits and so on. By avoiding direct legal “employment” of drivers, it is argued, Uber lowers costs to itself by making life more miserable for its drivers. 

Indeed, there has been a growing movement among drivers themselves to be recognized as employees precisely to claim the legal protections that come with classical employment, with the entire company now facing a [massive class-action lawsuit](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-appeals-class-action-ruling-in-worker-misclassification-lawsuit/) on the matter; in California, the legal status of Uber drivers as employees [has already been established]( http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-labor-commissioner-rules-uber-driver-employee-not-independent-contractor.html). They key point seems to be the legal definition of “contractor”, which is similar in many states. For example, [one author states that]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3):

>Under California law, the principal factor in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor is whether the employer “to whom service is rendered has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result desired.”

Uber drivers argue (successfully, in California) that [the degree to which Uber controls its drivers]( http://prospect.org/article/road-nowhere-3) means they are employees, not contractors. However, there is also some evidence that driver discontent may be an isolated phenomenon: one study [has suggested that](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/For-Hire-Vehicle-Transportation-Study.pdf) drivers significantly prefer contracting with Uber over working for traditional cab companies. 

Interestingly, this reclassification of employees as contractors has become [a larger pattern in the American economy that sociologists have named “Uberization”]( http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2014/05/18/rise-uberized-economy-means-business/). Thus, the current legal struggle affects not just Uber drivers, but has significant implications for the future of employment across the nation as a whole. 

To summarize: ***Are Uber employment practices legal or not? Do they truly add to the efficiency of the economy, or are they merely transferals of costs? Are the protests of the drivers legitimate?***

Why is terrorism so high on US priority list?," According to the [Global Terrorist Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) the total number of American deaths worldwide related to terrorism between 1995 and 2014 is 3,503, which avergages out to approximatly 184 deaths per year. [Twice as many people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate#United_States) die per year due to workplace accidents in retail alone.

At the same time, [experts estimate](http://money.cnn.com/2015/11/16/news/economy/cost-of-fighting-terrorism/) the US spends more than $100billion anually on counter-terrorism efforts, or [roughly 3% of its budget---about the same as it spends on Education and more than it spends on Transporation infrastructure costs or Science and Medical research](http://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/policy-basics-where-do-our-federal-tax-dollars-go). Voters [view terrorism](http://www.pollingreport.com/prioriti.htm) as more important to the American agenda than almost any other topic, including health care, climate change, and immigration.

How did the 1994 Crime Bill affect black/minority communities?,"I've recently seen a lot of news about [Joe Biden's history of enacted bills and the subsequent affect that had on communities](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration). 

So I was wondering the following:

* What data do we have that the crime bill was a positive/negative?
* How did the 1994 crime bill affect black/minority communities?"
"What are the merits of ""baby bonds"" as compared to other antipoverty measures?","Today NJ Senator and [likely 2020 Presidential Candidate](https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/03/where_booker_ranks_among_the_2020_democratic_presi.html) Cory Booker came out with a proposal for giving children in the US [""baby bonds""](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/22/17999558/cory-booker-baby-bonds) which would be a $1000 initial bond for all children born in the US, to which an amount would be added each year the child was under 18 depending on their parents' income.  

Booker's proposal [closely mirrors a proposal by Darrick Hamilton and William Darity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/01/08/theres-a-serious-proposal-to-give-every-baby-born-in-america-20000-or-more/?utm_term=.fb90d7d0071c) earlier this year.

Under Booker's proposal, each child born in the US would get a $1000 initial bond at birth, and then each year if their parents were below 500% of the federal poverty line, the government would add to it, depending on income. The accounts would accrue interest as well (the article says about 3%, but it is unclear exactly how it is calculated.)

The money would only be permitted to be used after age 18 for certain permitted expenses.  A full list was not provided, but examples of college tuition, a down payment on a house, and retirement were provided.

Within the US, how does this compare to current antipoverty programs in the US like [EITC,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit) [TANF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families) and [SNAP,](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap) as well as to proposals such as Kamala Harris' [proposal to greatly expand EITC](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/lefts-trump-sized-tax-plans/573328/)

Internationally, are there similar programs which could be used as a reference point?  Are those programs similarly generous to what Booker is proposing?"

How Does Executive Privilege Prevent Comey from Testifying?,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/31/us/politics/james-comey-testify-trump-russia-fbi.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share

>Senators expect the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to testify next week about his conversations with President Trump, congressional officials said on Wednesday, setting up a test of the White House’s willingness to cooperate with investigations into Mr. Trump’s associates.

>Putting the highly anticipated hearing on the calendar would force Mr. Trump to decide whether to invoke executive privilege and try to prevent Mr. Comey from testifying. Mr. Comey is expected to be asked about several conversations he had with the president, including one in which he says Mr. Trump encouraged him to stop investigating his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn.

Here's another article about it: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-comey-idUSKBN1862YC

How do the United States' current laws related to mental illness and firearms function in practice?,"As per Wikipedia, [The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act) prohibits anyone who ""has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental institution"" from ""shipping or transporting any firearm in interstate or foreign commerce, or receiving any firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessing any firearm in or affecting commerce""

Also, a [helpful NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/06/us/how-people-with-mental-illness-are-able-to-obtain-guns.html) states that "" individuals cannot buy a gun if a court or other authority has deemed them a “mental defective” or committed them involuntarily to a mental hospital."" 

My questions are
1: Who all is affected by this?
2: What all are those affected by this legislation restricted from doing?

Under question 1, I'll add the following 
A: Is this a lifetime ban? 
B: Does it include those who were involuntarily committed before the bill was passed?
C: Are minors treated differently, or would a person involuntarily committed as a minor be affected?
D: Can fully rehabilitated individuals become unaffected through any process? 

And under question 2, I'll add
A: Does this prevent affected individuals from buying guns in private sales? (That is, would they be punished for doing so?)

The alphabetized questions are mainly suggestions; they're not necessary to answer but they're things to consider in answering (and if you can answer them specifically, that's great too!)"
A Quality Conservative Podcast?,"Can someone direct me to an intelligent, conservative podcast?  I perused the prior podcast threads but most seem to suggest the left-of-center tracks I already listen to.


I tend to support progressive politics and the media I consume bears this out. The podcasts I currently listen to strive to be either neutral (fivethirtyeight.com Election Pod), left of center (Keepin' It 1600, The New York Times Politics Pod, The Skepticrats), or ""alien""(Dan Carlin's Common Sense). However, I wonder if part of the reason politics has run so hard to the wings in recent years is because we have failed to listen to each other. We stay in our own echo chambers. I want to listen to the other side because it helps me sharpen my own argument, but I might also find a genuinely good idea from time to time.  I believe it lies within the core values of this subreddit to try to understand opposing views as well as our own.


I want a podcast with good logic for conservative viewpoints. A sense of humor wouldn't hurt. Anyone who relies on demagoguery and anger, empty sentiment, or tries to argue their points with theology is a complete non-starter for me."
Are major sports leagues essentially monopolies?,"**Context of the case**: [""The Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/259us200), Maryland was a baseball club and a member of the Federal League of Professional Base Ball Players. The National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs conspired to monopolize the business of professional baseball by buying out members of the Federal League and by inducing members of the Federal League to leave.  The Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore brought suit in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia against the other leagues under the Sherman Act and obtained a verdict for $80,000. On appeal, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia reversed the lower court's ruling and held that the defendant baseball leagues were not within the Sherman Act's purview. The Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.""

The question under consideration by the Supreme Court in *Federal Baseball Club of Baltimore, Inc. v National League* was whether or not the activities of the National League of Professional Base Ball Clubs and the American League of Professional Base Ball Clubs were subject to the Sherman Act.  [The Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Baseball_Club_v._National_League) held that the baseball leagues were not subject to the Sherman Antitrust Act because the exhibitions that are baseball games are not trade or commerce as properly understood under the commerce clause.  In 1952, the Supreme Court had another opportunity to reverse the decision with *George Earl Toolson v New York Yankees Inc, et. al*, and in a one-paragraph per curium opinion, upheld it on the grounds that this [issue should remain under legislative purview and therefore should be left alone by the Court.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolson_v._New_York_Yankees,_Inc.)

> Subpoenas are not self-enforcing. If subpoenas are ignored or disobeyed, there needs to be an effective mechanism to compel compliance.

Nathan continues with outlining the two methods of enforcement:

> Inherent-contempt authority permits the House sergeant-at-arms to arrest the resisting party and bring him or her before the full House for a trial. If adjudicated in contempt, the person can be placed in prison until the contempt is cured or the session of Congress expires. This approach was approved by the Supreme Court in the early 19th century but has not been used since the early 20th century because of its obvious disadvantages and political unpalatability. The House doesn’t even have a prison.

and

> Criminal contempt is initiated by the speaker transmitting a certification of contempt to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Under the pertinent statute, the U.S. attorney is required to present the matter before a grand jury for the return of a felony indictment. Conviction would result in a prison term and/or fine. However, when it is an administration official who is carrying out the president’s policy in disobeying the subpoena, the Justice Department almost certainly will not prosecute.

I have two questions:

1: How have past Presidential administrations fought subpoenas? 

2: What specific political pressure and legislative actions have past Congresses taken to force compliance with subpoenas?

The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has released [an audit](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2842429/ESP-16-03-Final.pdf) (PDF) that faults Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State. Here is a [PBS article](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/state-department-email-audit-faults-hillary-clinton/) with more information:

*Hillary Clinton and her team ignored clear guidance from the State Department that her email setup broke federal standards and could leave sensitive material vulnerable to hackers, an independent audit has found. Her aides twice brushed aside concerns, in one case telling technical staff “the matter was not to be discussed further.”*

*The inspector general’s review also revealed that hacking attempts forced then-Secretary of State Clinton off email at one point in 2011, though she insists the personal server she used was never breached. Clinton and several of her senior staff declined to be interviewed for the State Department investigation.*

Although they do also note that others in the same office have followed similar standards:

*""A spokesman for Clinton, who served as the nation’s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013, declared the audit showed her email use was consistent with what others at the department have done.*

*The review encompassed the email and information practices of the past five secretaries of state, finding them “slow to recognize and to manage effectively the legal requirements and cybersecurity risks associated with electronic data communications, particularly as those risks pertain to its most senior leadership.”*

What impacts exist with counting prisoners using the current method in the US census?,"There was [a recent article in the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2020-census-prison-population_us_5a7cb966e4b044b3821b0507) that made me start thinking about this issue. 

The author of the article focuses primarily on the issue of redistricting based on this information. I was curious about other impacts, such as potential resources being diverted from lower income areas because of the way prisoners are being counted. Are there ways that this can affect areas beyond just the redistricting angle? 

The article is referring to the announcement on 14 February that the Census Bureau will continue the trend of counting prisoners at their location of incarceration, what they deem to be their 'usual residence'. [Their webpage](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/2020-census/about/residence-rule.html) explains the reasoning behind this.

> The Census Act of 1790 established the concept of “usual residence” as the main principle in determining where people should be counted, and this concept has been followed in all subsequent censuses. “Usual residence” has been defined as the place where a person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's voting residence or legal residence.

The article cites a [memo (pdf alert) from the Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/letters/2016/PPI_Demos_2016_FRN_comment.pdf) that lays out an argument for not counting prisoners where they are incarcerated. 

The numbers are not yet out for 2017, but with [a prison population at the end of 2016](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6187) of around 1.5 million people, it is worthy of discussion; looking at the arguments for and against counting prisoners where they are imprisoned and the potential impacts either direction can have on communities

Would that have been valuable to the efforts described in the indictments of Russian government officials for interfering in the 2016 elections?,"Yesterday in a court filing with [a major failure in redaction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/paul-manafort-shared-2016-polling-data-with-russian-employee-according-to-court-filing/2019/01/08/3f562ad8-12b0-11e9-803c-4ef28312c8b9_story.html) it was revealed that during the 2016 campaign, then Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort shared internal campaign polling with [Konstantin Kilimnick,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik) with whom he had also discussed giving briefings to [Oleg Derpiaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska) a prominent Russian businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin, about whom there is a controversy over the continuation of [sanctions.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-democrats-demand-treasury-explain-rollback-of-sanctions-on-russia-oligarch/2019/01/08/80285642-138e-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html)

Edit to add: since I posted this, [new reports have come out](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/09/politics/manafort-ukrainian-oligarchs/index.html) that Manafort intended the data to go to two pro-Russian Ukranian oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, and that Manafort expected contemporaneous payments from them of about $2.4 million.  Manafort denies the payments were related.

My question about this is what information would typically be seen in internal campaign polling?  Do they usually contain things which you wouldn't see in public polling such as [message testing](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2011/05/16/message-testing-v-push-polling) or other information designed to target media purchases or campaign activities?  What sort of information might be included?

"The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Acts, what now, what then?","The Congress and President of the United States of America have recently passed and signed into law the Hong Kong human rights and democracy act. This is a big thing over here.

The Chinese Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China has not been turning a blind eye to this, of course. Since the discussion of the bill China [responded that the bill ""fully reveals the ill intentions of some people in the United States to mess up Hong Kong and contain China's development.](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3030403/beijing-vows-retaliate-after-us-hong-kong-human-rights-bill). After the House passed the Act, Beijing condemned the move and said [it would take countermeasures](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3033266/china-warns-countermeasures-over-us-bill-supporting-hong-kong) and today after the bill was signed it reiterated that [China will take firm countermeasures](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN1Y204Z) in response.

I might have a political bias but to would like to stay focused on factual and legal discussions. I raise the following question/discussion points.

1. The Chinese Communist Party claims the bill is a “serious interference in Chinese affairs.” Is there any legal basis for that statement, or are there any legal definition which defines what is interfering in a country’s internal affairs?

2. The bill is triggered by the massive ongoing unrest in Hong Kong. China [claims the protests in Hong Kong is fuelled to a large extent by “foreign interference”](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3031240/decrying-foreign-interference-china-should) What are, if any, some evidence that the protests are actually a result of foreign interferences?

2. This is not the first time the Chinese Communist Party has raised a finger and told others not to interfere in their internal affairs. Some exhibits [here](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1938622/stop-interfering-hong-kong-affairs-beijing-warns-european), and [here](https://www.cityam.com/top-mp-denies-british-interference-in-hong-kong-after-chinese-ambassadors-warning/amp/). Is there any evidence that the People’s Republic of China under ‘foreign interferences’, or if there’s none, why are they claiming that so often?

3. A little speculative question but I believe it can be answered factually: China has warned US of ‘firm countermeasures’. Without jumping into speculations, what are the current tools and cars on the table that the Chinese Communist Party can use as countermeasures in what they view as interference from a hostile foreign nation?

Thank you!"
What are the arguments for and against the U.S. leaving the U.N. Human Rights Council?,"Today the [United States announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html) they would depart the U.N. Human Rights Council over, or least in part because: 

> in protest of its frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N.,  elaborated on the decision: 

> “Earlier this year, as it has in previous years, the Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against Israel — more than the number passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined,” Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said in a speech on Tuesday. “This disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel is clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not by human rights.”

> “If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility,” Ms. Haley said.

-----------------------

Former Republican diplomat Elliot Abrams briefly touched on an argument for staying, but agreed that the Council's bias against Israel is too much to ignore and leaving is the right decision, saying: 

> “There is always an argument for staying, which is that the United States will be in a better position to help defend Israel,” Mr. Abrams said. “But this council is hopelessly compromised, so leaving is the right choice.”

--------------------------------

Rob Berschinski, a senior vice president at Human Rights First, agreed the Council is not perfect, but made the argument the U.S. is potentially giving up leverage:

> “Countries like China, Russia and Venezuela will applaud this decision because we are freely giving up leverage over them that we previously had,” Mr. Berschinski said.

--------------------------------

1: From the perspective of the United States, what are the arguments or pros and cons of the United States leaving the U.N. Human Rights Council?

2: If at all, how does this affect the Council's credibility?

"Direct Farm Subsidies Ended in 2014, What Has Changed?","Three years ago, on Feb. 7th, 2014, the 2014 Farm Bill ([Agricultural Act of 2014, H.R. 2642] (https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr2642enr/pdf/BILLS-113hr2642enr.pdf)) was signed into law.

How has this change in government assistance affected [farm subsidies over time] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/07/02/GR2006070200024.html)?  Is the US government paying more or less now than it was using direct payment subsidies?  Should the US continue to subsidize farming this way?  Are there better solutions?

[META] r/NeutralPolitics needs more moderators! Apply here.,"**EDIT:** The application period is now closed. Thank you to everyone who applied. We'll make an announcement to introduce the new team members when they've been added.

------

Hello everyone! 

Thank you all for the continued support to make this sub the strong community it is. Our sub relies on active, committed, and passionate moderators, and to that end we're putting out an open request for new mod applications to make sure we can keep the discussion at the level you expect.

Here's what the job entails:

First, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend an hour or more reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.

Second, you need to be familiar with [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. Mods read all submissions, and we make an effort to read all comments as well. The vast majority of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and/or work with them to craft an acceptable post. Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.

We also make heavy use of browser extensions to assist us with our work, so you will need to be able to moderate from a computer with a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, and be willing to install a few extensions.

Other responsibilities include:

* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.
* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.
* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.
* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.

If you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with the following info:

* A brief explanation of why you want to join the team
* Why you would be a good fit
* Your time zone, or what time you would be available to help moderate
* Which forest animal you would be and why

* Do not tell us your political leaning. **Any application that includes such information will automatically be disqualified.**

We look forward to hearing from you."

What are the arguments for and against requiring companies to modify their encryption to allow government access?,"Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, in a [speech yesterday at the US Naval Academy](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/trumps-doj-tries-to-rebrand-weakened-encryption-as-responsible-encryption/), argued in favor of requiring companies such as Apple to modify their encryption in order to allow law enforcement to access encrypted data.

Rosentstein [commented on](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/deputy-attorney-general-rod-j-rosenstein-delivers-remarks-encryption-united-states-naval) both the practical and constitutional aspects of the issue:

> Encrypted communications that cannot be intercepted and locked devices that cannot be opened are law-free zones that permit criminals and terrorists to operate without detection by police and without accountability by judges and juries.

> [...] there has never been a right to absolute privacy. Courts weigh privacy against other values, including the need to solve and prevent crimes. [...] Warrant-proof encryption defeats the constitutional balance by elevating privacy above public safety. [...] There is no constitutional right to sell warrant-proof encryption.

This seems to be a continuation of the previous administration's position on encryption, where the [FBI obtained a federal court](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/a-brief-explanation-of-apples-showdown-with-the-us-government.html) order compelling Apple to assist in gaining access to the San Bernandino shooter's iPhone.

A number of technology companies have [spoken out against the government's position](https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11156704/apple-fbi-amicus-briefs-iphone-encryption-fight), such as in this [amicus brief](https://www.scribd.com/doc/302014025/Apple-Brief-Of-Twitter-And-Other-Web-Companies?irgwc=1&content=10079&campaign=Skimbit%2C%20Ltd.&ad_group=66960X1514734X5ff79d4452069ae5ad3fe358a8b51c1a&keyword=ft750noi&source=impactradius&medium=affiliate) from Twitter, Reddit, CloudFlare, and others:

> If the government is able to compel companies to break their own security measures, the users of those companies will necessarily lose confidence that their data is being handled in a secure, open manner. [...] Technological backdoors, whether or not built for specific and supposedly limited purposes, create an opportunity for criminals and hackers to exploit.

What are the merits of the arguments on both sides? Is there existing precedent to support the government's position? Have other countries implemented similar requirements, and if so how have those worked out?"
Why did Papadopoulos' lies prevent the FBI from detaining or arresting Professor Mifsud?,"##FBI Claims Lies Interfered with Investigation

The FBI claims that Papadopoulos' lies prevented them from detaining or arresting Professor Mifsud when he was in the United States.

[From the FBI:](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-george-papadopoulos-sentencing-memo)

>Seventh, the lies were material to the investigation. The defendant’s lies to the FBI in January 2017 impeded the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, **those statements substantially hindered investigators’ ability to effectively question the Professor when the FBI located him in Washington, D.C. approximately two weeks after the defendant’s January 27, 2017 interview**. The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. **The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017** and he has not returned to the United States since then.

How did Papadopoulos' statements hinder the investigators' ability to question Professor Mifsud?

##Papadopoulos' False Statements

[These are the lies according to the FBI (PDF):](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download)

>a. Defendant **PAPADOPOULOS claimed that his interactions with an overseas professor**, who defendant PAPADOPOULOS understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials, **occurred before defendant PAPADOPOULOS became a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign**. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS acknowledged that the professor had told him about the Russians possessing ""dirt"" on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of""thousands of emails,"" but stated multiple times that he learned that information prior to joining the Campaign. In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS learned he would be an advisor to the Campaign in early March, and met the professor on or about March 14, 2016; the professor only took interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign; and the professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the ""thousands of emails"" on or about April 26, 2016, when defendant PAPADOPOULOS had been a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign for over a month. 
>
>b. Defendant **PAPADOPOULOS further told the investigating agents that the professor was "" a nothing"" and ""just a guy talk[ing] up connections or something.""** In truth and in fact, however, defendant **PAPADOPOULOS understood that the professor had substantial connections to Russian government officials** (and had met with some ofthose officials in Moscow immediately prior to telling defendant PAPADOPOULOS about the ""thousands of emails"") and, over a period of months, defendant PAPADOPOULOS repeatedly sought to use the professor's Russian connections in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials. 
>
>c. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS claimed he met a certain female Russian national before he joined the Campaign and that their communications consisted of emails such as, '""Hi , how are you?""' In truth and in fact, however, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met the female Russian national on or about March 24, 2016, after he had become an adviser to the Campaign; he believed that she had connections to Russian government officials; and he sought to use her Russian connections over a period ofmonths in an effort to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.

What stopped the FBI from questioning the professor? Papadopoulos told the FBI the professor was the source of his information. Isn't that enough to do something when the professor is in the country?"

After reading and participating in the thread about the fourteenth amendment the other day, I realized that how an amendment is interpreted and implemented is not so simple, especially if a part of it's language is vague.

Minority Governments in Germany,"The 2017 Federal Election in Germany saw [major losses for the CDU/CSU and and the SPD, while minor political parties such as the FDP and AfD made significant gains](https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/09/first-results). After receiving the [lowest share of the vote since the Second World War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/merkel-wins-fourth-term-as-main-parties-suffer-historic-setbacks), the SPD lead by Martin Schulz decided to [go into opposition and not renew its 4 year assosiaction with the CDU/CSU](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/merkel-wins-fourth-term-as-main-parties-suffer-historic-setbacks).

This has lead to talks these past few days wherin high ranking officials from both parties came together to strike a new deal in order to effectively form a government, though there has been serious backlash from within the SPD leading to citizens and high ranking party officials [voicing their doubts on the German news service, Tagesschau.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2yrPCiaV8M)


I don't know how these talks will turn out, I'm not a fortune teller, but in hearing and reading this news I realized I really didn't know what would happen if the talks fell through and a coalition (whether the Grand Coalition or the Jamaica Coalition) wasn't formed. I'm not familiar with the Grundgesetz, and I don't know what is and isn't possible within the German government, which leads me to my questions:

**What happens in the German government if no party can form a majority?** Are minority governments possible given German law? I can't find anything references the formation of a minority government since German reunification, so I assume there hasn't been one. Am I correct in assuming there hasn't been one though? And if that's the case, was it because such a thing was unnecessary or impossible?

**Furthermore, if the existence of minority governments is possible in the German system, what are they like?** Do they share similarities with other nations' minority governments, such as in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, or are German minority governments unlike all others?

Thanks for your time."

This bill mandates penalties for frivolous lawsuits, where previously penalties were issued at the judges discretion.

What might count as a frivolous lawsuit and does this legislation benefit any groups or types of groups disproportionately?

Does either bill have any effect on patent trolling?"
Is there evidence to suggest the attempted Turkey coup was or wasn't staged?,"Fethullah Gülen, who Erdoğan has blamed for the coup, said ""There is a possibility that it could be a staged coup"". His media advisor elaborated:

> The coup appears to be poorly planned, very poorly executed and everything seems to be playing into Erdoğan’s hands. There are many big question marks of how [this attempted coup] was executed.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/16/fethullah-gulen-turkey-coup-erdogan

While a lot of people in comment sections on the internet are liking the idea that it was staged, Dani Rodrik, a Turkish economist and international development expert at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, writes:

> The coup attempt is very puzzling. For one thing, it seems to have been very poorly planned. For example, most TV channels were left operating and there does not seem to have been an attempt to take Erdogan in. And as I write this, it seemed to be collapsing. Second, it is not clear who would benefit from a coup. The military is no longer the secularist stronghold with a strong esprit de corps and sense of mission it once was. (Hence the widespread theory in Turkey that this was a coup staged by Erdogan himself, designed to pave the way for an Erdogan dictatorship. But this doesn’t quite ring true either, in light of Erdogan’s recent attempts to mend fences with Russia and Israel to strengthen the economy. He must know that even a failed coup would wreak havoc with the economy.)

However, [this was only 4.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_daily_changes_in_the_Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) of the market, which is significantly smaller than other historic drops, the past five of which averaged around 7%. 

Most of the other large drops can be attributed to the Recession of 2008, which occurred at the end of Bush's presidency. Two notable outliers were a 5% drop in 2011, and a 7% drop in 1997. 

Politifact published [an analysis indicating that the Stock Market performs better under Democratic Presidents](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2018/jan/08/how-trump-obama-compare-stock-market/), however, the DOW has grown about 35%(see link above) during Trumps presidency so far. 

How do presidencies and their policies affect the stock market(if at all) and how is the current market under Trump comparing to past presidencies?"
How much is Trump financially benefiting from this vacations?,"After seeing a tweet from [The Daily Edge](https://twitter.com/TheDailyEdge) purporting that President Trump took [111 days of vacation](https://twitter.com/TheDailyEdge/status/945841207527333891) in his first year of office, I did a little digging because of The Daily Edge's strong bias.   [The Hill](http://thehill.com/), (which allsides.com calls center, and mediabiasfactcheck.com calls slightly left leaning.) lists the number as 97 days.

The 4 days difference may be because there are 4 days left in the year and the President is scheduled to be on vacation at Mar-A-Lago, his luxury club in Florida, the Hill may be limiting themselves to vacation days that actually have taken place.

The thing that caught my eye was Mar-A-Lago.

A Trump property... 

I was mentally equating Trump taking vacation at one of his properties with President Bush taking vacation at his own his ranch in Crawford, Texas, but that didn't sit right.

You can't rent out time at the Bush ranch.   It is not a for profit institution.

[Mar-A-Lago](http://www.maralagoclub.com/) is.  And so is [Trump Golf](http://www.maralagoclub.com/Default.aspx?p=dynamicmodule&pageid=100008&ssid=100030&vnf=1).

So two questions come to mind, neither of which I know how to research:

* How much does President Trump personally profit from the taxpayer money spent on his vacation at a Trump owned property?

and the second very similar question, assuming that the President of the United States staying at a given place is a bump to that business going forward because people want to stay someplace the President has stayed:

* Of the Trump properties that the President has stayed at, has there been any pattern of *which* properties and how their business picked up after he stayed?

i.e. has he been intentionally bolstering troubled Trump businesses?"
"What policies have proven effective enough in other countries that they can be assembled into a ""whole-of-government"" response to climate change?","In a rather unexpected outcome, [SECDEF James Mattis stated](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/james-mattis-us-defence-secretary-climate-change-destabilise-world-security-donald-trump-global-a7630676.html) ""I agree that the effects of a changing climate — such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others — impact our security situation,"" that ""climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today,” and that ""climate change is a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of government response.”

While [somewhat unpopular in the GOP](http://www.gallup.com/poll/190010/concern-global-warming-eight-year-high.aspx), there are some prominent politicians within the GOP that affirm climate change.  For example, [Carly Fiorina's position was paraphrased by the National Review](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/422395/carly-fiorina-climate-change-left): ""If the scientific consensus is that man-made climate change is real, there is also consensus that America, acting alone, cannot stop it. Indeed, the Chinese are only too happy to watch us constrict our economy as they capture the market in clean coal.""  Such a position, if valid, precludes the US government unilaterally passing climate change legislation that would be effectual.

Given these arguments, what would be a plausible ""whole-of-government"" response to climate change that would tackle what Mattis considers to be a national security threat?"
The US Treasury is the arbiter of whether airlines receiving taxpayer funds can cancel routes between cities.

2. In normal circumstance, how much autonomy do US air carriers have in deciding how often and where to fly to? Was there any previous regulation mandating carriers maintain routes?"
[Mod Post] Canada election information,"For those not aware, there is currently a Canadian election ongoing.  Election day is Monday October 21.

**Voting Information**

[Elections Canada has detailed information on the logistics of voting.](https://elections.ca/home.aspx)  If you are a Canadian citizen and 18 or older, you are legally entitled to vote.  Early voting, absentee voting, and same day registration are available.

**Change from prior elections: voters who live abroad**  

There is no longer any requirement to have lived in Canada recently to be able to vote.  In January this year, [the Supreme Court ruled](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17446/index.do) that Canadian citizens are entitled to vote at their last address in Canada no matter how long they have been outside the country.  So if you are a long-term Canadian expatriate, you can [apply to be on the International Register of Electors](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&dir=reg/etr&document=index&lang=e) and cast your ballot by mail.

**Change from prior elections: formally organized leader debates.**

Newly formed for this election, the [Leader's Debates Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaders%27_Debates_Commission) is organizing a pair of debates, in English and French, among party leaders.

The English debate is Monday, October 7.

The French debate is Thursday, October 10.

**How elections in Canada work**

There will be a First Past the Post election for [all 338 seats in the House of Commons.](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?dir=ces&document=part1&lang=e&section=res) Each seat represents one geographic district, called a “riding,” which represents a specific area within a province (or in the case of the territories, the entire territory).  Candidates generally affiliate with a political party.  If a single party wins the majority of seats [it will form government by convention.](https://www.ourcommons.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch01&Seq=2&Language=E)  If no party wins a majority, then parties may negotiate to form a coalition, or the party with a plurality of seats may seek to from a minority government, which it can do as long as it does not lose a vote of no confidence.

**Changement par rapport aux élections précédentes: électeurs résidant à l'étranger**

Il n'est plus nécessaire d'avoir vécu récemment au Canada pour pouvoir voter. En janvier de cette année, [la Cour suprême a statué](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/fr/item/17446/index.do) que les citoyens canadiens ont le droit de voter à leur dernière adresse au Canada, peu importe combien de temps ils ont passé en dehors du territoire.

Il y aura un scrutin uninominal majoritaire à un tour pour [les 338 sièges à la Chambre des communes.](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?dir=ces&document=part1&lang=f&section=res) Chaque siège représente un district géographique, appelé «circonscription», qui représente une région spécifique d'une province (ou, dans le cas des territoires, de l'ensemble du territoire). Les candidats s'affilient généralement à un parti politique. Si un seul parti remporte la majorité des sièges, [il formera un gouvernement par convention.](https://www.noscommunes.ca/marleaumontpetit/DocumentViewer.aspx?Sec=Ch01&Seq=2&Language=F) Si aucun parti ne remporte la majorité, les partis peuvent alors négocier pour former une coalition ou le parti ayant la majorité relative peut chercher à obtenir un

This shift is largely seen as revolving around the [South China Sea dispute,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea) which has China claiming a large portion of the area, while neighboring nations of Brunei, Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam have disputed the claim.

Bernie Sanders vs. Verizon: Who is right?,"Recently, Sanders made a claim that [Verizon doesn't pay any taxes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bruce-kushnick/verizon-ny-paid-virtually_b_9667024.html).  A simple google search will show that this claim is supported by a wide variety of sources, many from several years ago (before politics might add extra biases) ([1](http://www.lohud.com/story/news/2014/02/26/study-verizon-paid-no-federal-income-taxes/5852539/), [2](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/25/corporation-tax-rate_n_4855763.html), [3](http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/10/23/big-companies-pay-no-taxes/2480281/)), so there must be at least *some* truth to the claim.

However, [Verizon's CEO recently made a statement that Bernie is entirely incorrect](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/senator-sanders-needs-get-his-facts-straight), and a look a [Verizon's latest SEC 10-K filing](http://verizon.api.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EdgarPro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?SessionID=GQYoeDso-hr2yxm&ID=11203121) seems to agree with the CEO's claim. (For those who don't want to search through that monotonous document, the ""total income tax provision"" noted for 2015 is $9865 million). 

This should be a cut-and-dry issue, no?  The amount of money paid from Verizon to the federal government in 2015 should should be a simple fact, but I am having a lot of trouble finding any sources which can put this to rest.

**tldr: How much money did Verizon actually pay to the federal government in 2015?**

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, everybody.  I learned quite a bit from the discussion, and I'll summarize some of my conclusions up here for posterity.  

* Ultimately, Verizon is paying its federal taxes, as far as I can tell from the 10-K, or as far as most of the commenters here can tell.
* Bernie isn't directly lying, however.  As pointed out by /u/jacksonmills, Verizon *New York* has not paid any taxes in a while, largely due to repeated losses. 
* As noted by multiple people, most of the reason that corporations avoid paying taxes in a given year is [Tax loss carryforward](http://www.wikinvest.com/wiki/Tax_loss_carryforward), which explains some of the suspect years."

How has the Magnitsky Act impacted Russian entry into the US? How has it influenced trade negotiations between Russia and the US?,"In 2012, the United States Congress passed a law known as the Magnitsky Act that barred certain Russian citizens from traveling to and entering the United States. The law requires the government to identify Human Rights abusers from Russia, and bar them from entry. 

This act was passed as a clause in one of the first formalized trade agreements with Russia (since the fall of the USSR) where:

> The most immediate effect of the bill would be to formally normalize trade relations with Russia after nearly 40 years. Since the 1970s, commerce between Russia and the United States has been subject to restrictions that were intended to punish Communist nations that kept their citizens from emigrating freely.

* Or is it keeping high-profile financial criminals and human rights abusers from Russia out of the US? 

* Has it been effective in at least impeding the interests of the people the Magnitsky Act was intended to work on (at least in the US)?

* How has this law impacted Russian entry into the US since the law went into effect?

We get about 4 or 5 user submissions per day, but most don't comply with our submission rules.  If you have an idea for a post and aren't sure about the rules, ask us for help and we can help make sure it works.

* We sometimes get asked what ""neutral"" means with respect to this subreddit and how it plays into our moderation. This is covered in the [guidelines,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_neutral-ness) but basically, we moderate by the rules, not by personal opinion. We don't remove content because either we or you don't like it. Submissions must be framed in a neutral way, per Rule B, but **there is no neutrality requirement for comments.** Participating in the comments does not require you to be neutral. It requires you to be factual and respectful. The [four rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) are what apply and we remove content that violates them.
* Our companion news subreddit, r/NeutralNews, is not dead. The reboot has taken a lot longer than we expected, but we've just begun testing our new moderation tools there, so we are making progress.

How does Warren anti-corruption bill compare to global policy?,"Elizabeth Warren has introduced legislation aimed at curbing corruption and introducing mechanisms to enforce accountability, and to democratize large corporations by mandating % of their boards be elected by employees.

I've heard that there are other OCED with policy attempting to accomplish similar goals, but I don't have good exposure to how those policies work or how they compare to Warren's proposal.

**My primary questions are:**

* How does Warren's bill compare to legislation already in place in other countries (ideally implemented long enough ago to have generated good data)
* Is there any reason based on text of the bill that it will be particularly successful or problematic

Also, this is with the caveat that I understand that in current political environment it is likely DOA on the floor, so this discussion is basically just academic.

What was the motivation for HIPAA?

"With regard to the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint and the presidential impeachment process, from a legal/constitutional perspective, does the identity of the whistleblower matter, or only the whistleblower's assertions?","> [On 12 August 2019, an unnamed CIA officer filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), under the provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA). Atkinson looked into the complaint and interviewed several government officials whom the whistleblower identified as having information to substantiate his claims. On August 26, having found **the complaint to be both ""credible"" and ""of urgent concern""** (as defined by the ICWPA), and noting the ""subject matter expertise"" of the whistleblower, Atkinson transmitted the complaint to Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal#Whistleblower_complaints)

&nbsp;

>[Since the beginning of whistleblowing in America, government whistleblowers who put their name and face on their revelations have not fared well, particularly those from the intelligence community. They are typically tarred in the media, often prosecuted and almost inevitably fired and blackballed from further government service. “So far as I’m aware, from [Daniel] Ellsberg to the present day, there hasn't been a single case in which a genuine whistleblower who exposed major problems in the intelligence community has experienced anything other than retaliation,” Patrick Eddington, a former CIA employee who revealed that his agency and the military were covering up U.S. soldiers’ exposure to toxins during the 1991 Iraq War, told me. Especially in an unstable, emotionally charged, politically polarized era like the one in which the current whistleblower is operating, government truth-tellers are all too easily vilified as traitors, deflecting attention from the problems they are attempting to reveal. ](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/26/whistleblower-identity-ukraine-history-of-retaliation-228324)

# Questions:

* With regard to the Trump-Ukraine whistleblower complaint and the presidential impeachment process, from a legal/constitutional perspective, does the identity of the whistleblower matter, or only the whistleblower's assertions?

* Does the identity of the whistleblower affect the procedure for employees and contractors of specified federal intelligence agencies to report complaints or information to Congress about serious problems involving intelligence activities outlined in the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998? 

* Does the identity of the whistleblower have any other legal effects?

* Are there any legal or regulatory reasons why a whistleblower must identify themselves?"
Is it possible to enforce mental and physical health thresholds for a President?,"There has been a lot of speculation about [Trump's mental health](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/201701/shrinks-battle-over-diagnosing-donald-trump). I can't imagine anyone could diagnose a person without an actual examination, so I take these reports with a huge grain of salt. The health of candidates was an issue even during the primaries leading up to the election.

Everyone's health is private and a leader's health issues must be a secret so that adversarial powers don't get an advantage.

But at the same time, since many candidates are past their middle age by the time they get to the Presidency ([average age is 55 as per Wikipedia] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age))  how should the citizens be assured that their leader is in the best physical and mental state to handle the enormous responsibilities that come with the position?"
"Is illegal immigration a problem in the US, and if so, what should be done?","Thanks to /u/Marlinsoverdolphins for proposing this topic.

----

A majority of Americans [believe illegal immigration is a problem](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/zqz3kg39gt/tabs_OPI_Illegal_Immigration_20150902.pdf) (PDF) and voters [broadly support measures to curb it.](http://www.fairus.org/facts/illegal-immigration-and-amnesty-polls)

However, the Obama administration [deported more illegal immigrants than any in history,](http://www.snopes.com/obama-deported-more-people/) while the total number of illegal immigrants in the country [peaked in 2007 and has been slowly declining since then.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/) 

So, is illegal immigration really a problem in the US? If so, what are the best solutions?

[This article](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/431012/fixing-illegal-immigration-five-steps) argues for a strictly enforced kind of ""one strike"" policy, whereby anyone found to have entered the country illegally is thereafter ineligible for any legal status. Along those lines, the non-profit Federation for American Immigration Reform, an ""organization of concerned individuals who believe that our immigration laws must be reformed to better serve the needs of current and future generations,"" issued their [Priorities for the 2017 Presidential Transition,](http://www.fairus.org/news/fair-issues-blueprint-for-true-immigration-reform-in-the-new-administration) which outlines even more extensive measures to address the issue.

On the other hand, [Ron Paul says](https://mises.org/blog/how-solve-illegal-immigration-problem) we simply have to:

> Eliminate incentives for those who would come here to live off the rest of us, and make it easier and more rational for those who wish to come here legally to contribute to our economy. No walls, no government databases, no biometric national ID cards. But not a penny in welfare for immigrants.

Is there evidence suggesting what effect any of these proposals would have on illegal immigration? Have other countries curbed their immigration problems with specific measures like these? Has the US done so in the past?

The actual state of the International healthcare market,"It is [often](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-08-03/canadians-increasingly-come-to-us-for-health-care) suggested that a [healthcare](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yp3qy5/fact-checking-trump-are-canadians-swarming-the-border-to-get-better-healthcare) migrant [market](http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/2009/08/21/canadians-crossing-the-border-for-u-s-health-care/) exists internationally, that people come from Europe, Canada, and Mexico to receive superior/faster healthcare in the US.

Was Senate Rule 19 properly invoked by McConnell against Warren to prevent her from criticizing Sessions' character?,"Yesterday evening during Senate debate over the confirmation of Jeff Sessions to US Attorney General, Mitch McConnell [invoked Rule 19](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/08/the-silencing-of-elizabeth-warren-and-an-old-senate-rule-prompted-by-a-fistfight/?utm_term=.4bd79a74f598) to prevent Elizabeth Warren from reading a [letter](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/08/514085145/read-coretta-scott-kings-letter-that-got-sen-elizabeth-warren-silenced) written by Coretta King which accused Sessions of abusing the power of his office while AG of Alabama to intimidate elderly black voters.

The relevant piece of the text of [Rule 19](http://www.rules.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=RuleXIX) reads:

>No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.

The (very brief) [history](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/censure_cases/090Tillman_Laurin.htm) of Rule 19 is essentially this: during a debate on a bill one Senator accused another of taking a particular position on that bill due to ""improper influences."" The accused Senator, after being informed of what was said, rushed into the Senate chambers, had a short, heated argument, then began having a fistfight with the Senator who made the accusation. After the incident, the Senate created Rule 19.

It's not super clear what ""conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator"" means, but I think saying a Senator once abused his office as a state Attorney General to carry out a program of racist voter suppression probably qualifies. So, McConnell's argument is pretty straightforward; that accusation falls within the bounds of Rule 19, Warren made that accusation, so she violated Rule 19.

Is that a proper application of Rule 19, or was McConnell's move unjustified?"
Did Hillary Clinton commit perjury at the Benghazi hearings?,"During [FBI Director Comey's testimony](http://www.c-span.org/video/?412315-1/fbi-director-james-comey-testifies-hillary-clinton-email-probe&live&vod), Republican lawmakers cited two major ""untruths"" in her Benghazi testimony:

___
*Other notable discrepancies:*

*1. She claims to have used ""one device"".  I'm unsure whether Comey's comment that she used ""several devices"" indicates that she used them simultaneously, or subsequently.*

*2. She claims she did not delete work-related emails from her account, but Comey admitted the evidence on this one is difficult to parse.*

*3. Many documents formerly unclassified have been retroactively ""up-classified"", which is common practice and speaks to problems within the government itself, rather than Clinton in particular.*"
"Most of Reddit is severely anti-CISPA, so I came here looking for a neutral perspective","Re-posting my earlier question with some guidance from the mods.

There are a lot of posts out there that focus on what CISPA is and what it will do. The overwhelming consensus on reddit is that it is indeed bad. I've heard a lot of negative things, including that my rights might be infringed if it does pass.

But there are two sides to every story.

Do US school districts choosing to be online-only risk violating the 14th amendment equal protection clause?,"[Several large us regions and districts are considering or have actually announced plans to continue online-only learning.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/13/us/school-reopening-plans-major-cities/index.html)

For example (from the above article):

>California's two largest school districts announced Monday that schools will not open for any in-person instruction when the academic year starts in August, and that students will continue to learn remotely. Los Angeles Unified School District and San Diego Unified School District are the largest school districts to date to forgo any type of in-person instruction.

[In earlier months, online learning presented a clear challenge to many families and areas because of inadequate or non-existent access to internet services.  Districts and governments offered some solutions such as hotspots, but those do not work adequately in rural areas and add significant hardship to families in other areas.](https://edsource.org/2020/more-california-students-are-online-but-digital-divide-runs-deep-with-distance-learning/630456)

>Over the last few weeks, state leaders have said that an estimated one in five California students — approximately [1.2 million](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/20/governor-newsom-announces-cross-sector-partnerships-to-support-distance-learning-and-bridge-the-digital-divide/) — lacked broadband or a computer to access distance learning. The problems are particularly acute in rural areas, where only 34% of households are subscribed to an internet service compared with 78% in urban areas, according to an EdSource analysis of 2018 data.  
>  
>Major progress has already been made as districts, private donors and elected officials rush to get devices to students, but hundreds of thousands of students remain unable to access online learning.

and

>Rural schools are finding mobile WiFi devices don’t work at all for students in some of the most remote parts of the state that lack broadband infrastructure. That’s the case in Del Norte Unified, which consists of 11 schools and is the single district within Del Norte County, which reaches the Oregon border.  
>  
>“A lot of students are in places where there isn’t consistent power, let alone internet,” said Ryan Bahten, director of information network services for Del Norte Unified, located just south of the Oregon border. “These hotspots are a nonstarter for us,” referring to WiFi devices donated by T-Mobile to the California Department of Education.

In the landmark case Brown v Board of Education, the [court opinion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/347/483/USSC_PRO_347_483_1) seemed to make it clear that equal access to schooling is a constitutionally protected right:

>Today, education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.

Regardless of the specific situation in California, do districts risk running afoul of 14th amendment protections if they are unable to provide equal access to online learning for all students and have chosen to be online-only?"

I was able to find some articles [here,](http://www.dw.com/en/report-refugees-have-not-increased-crime-rate-in-germany/a-18848890) [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugees-responsible-for-tiny-proportion-of-sex-crimes-in-germany-despite-far-right-claims-following-a6884166.html) and [here](https://www.ft.com/content/b5a8867e-28ea-11e7-bc4b-5528796fe35c?mhq5j=e3), but they do not give pure data, I don't feel as if I'm presented the whole truth if all I get is general % increase in comparison to X and quotes, it seems like data presented in a very biased way. 

I understand that it might be slightly too much to ask, this data might not be released to the public, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

Is there historical precedent for a gag order remaining in place following sentencing in a trial?,"The sentencing phase of the Roger Stone trial has just finished.

What structural reforms decrease partisanship / polarization?,"I'm curious what would most help the US decrease toxic partisanship. Toxic partisanship is hard to quantify, but [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/opinion/hate-politics.html) best articulates what I mean. Some troubling statistics:

* Just over [42 percent](https://www.dannyhayes.org/uploads/6/9/8/5/69858539/kalmoe___mason_ncapsa_2019_-_lethal_partisanship_-_final_lmedit.pdf) of the people in each party view the opposition as “downright evil.”

"Regarding criminal justice reform, what are the differences between the policies supported by Democrats and Republicans?

Some Republican-led states with high inmate populations, like Texas and [Louisiana](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/policing/spotlight/2017/04/14/prison-louisiana-policing-the-usa/100432314/), have also initiated reform.

In Democrat-led states, proposals focus heavily on rehabilitation. One example is a [plan for prison reform from Hawaii](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/HCR-85_task_force_final_report.pdf). Excerpts:

""Evidence...confirms that the rehabilitative approach is the only sustainable way to make our communities safe,"" p. iii

""Hawai‘i should transition from a punitive to a rehabilitative correctional system,"" p. xiv

""Hawai‘i’s Correctional System Should Incorporate Key Elements of the Norwegian/European Correctional Model,"" p. 11

The [Norway model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_Norway). (It should be noted that Norway has only 5.2 million people, is not very multicultural, and has a highly educated population. Its people are pretty amendable to its criminal justice model.)

An article on the [Norway corrections model](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/18/prisonsandprobation-norway)  offers some interesting comments:

>""...two of the leading lights of European prison reform....reflect on what has allowed Norway to keep its prison population low and to generate such public support for this approach. Christie suggests that having a functioning welfare state has done a great deal, for this makes it difficult to create ""social distance"", so that each person feels connected to everyone else and therefore no one gets scapegoated for the troubles that occur.""

Can the Norway model of criminal justice be applied to the US? Is there the political will to advance the U.S. welfare state enough to effectively implement something like the Norway model?

Overall, what are the major differences between the policy proposals of the two major parties related to criminal justice reform? Given that state governments and the Federal government are divided between those parties, what's a model of criminal justice reform that suits both of them?"

"In regards to understanding Trump's way of communicating, do the comments by Michael Cohen in his testimony to the House Oversight Committee meet the legal definition of subornation of perjury by the President?","On Wednesday, [Michael Cohen testified in front of the House Oversight Committee](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/27/ex-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-testify-house-oversight-committee/2995659002/).

I'm confused by Cohen's comments and how this mixes with what the Special Counsel has said. 

[BuzzFeed News](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/trump-russia-cohen-moscow-tower-mueller-investigation) put out a report earlier this year that Cohen had been ""directed"" by Trump to lie to congress. This would seem like obvious subornation of perjury for the President, but then the [Special Counsel put out a statement disputing this](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/politics/mueller-statement-buzzfeed/index.html).

With Cohen's testimony, he affirms the idea that it was not a direct order, but also says he clearly understood what Trump wanted.

Does this constitute [18 U.S. Code § 1622](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1622), subornation of perjury for the President?

Why did Michigan Ban plastic bag bans?,"My home state of Michigan recently passed [Public Act 389](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/publicact/htm/2016-PA-0389.htm) which is ""a bill to preempt local ordinances regulating the use, disposition, or sale of, prohibiting or restricting, or imposing any fee, charge, or tax on certain containers."" 

The bill is a reaction to legislation from my home county, Washtenaw, which enacted a [10-cent bag tax for paper and plastic](http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2016/06/10-cent_bag_tax_at_washtenaw_c.html). The State legislation killed our county level legislation. This didn't get much play in the media but what was out there called it a [plastic bag ban ban](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/30/yes-this-is-real-michigan-just-banned-banning-plastic-bags/?utm_term=.dfe273b3e67f#comments).  

**Is there a legitimate reason to preemptive block municipalities from passing taxes on undesirable containers such as plastic bans?**

My research is below.
Washtenaw County hoped to address two main issues with the ordinance:

* To offset the costs of processing plastic bags, which it estimated at $219k [per year](http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/departments/environmental_health/recycling_home_toxics/carryout-bag-ordinance/Reusable%20Bag%20Ordinance%20Work%20Session%20PresentationFINAL.pdf) (the tax would bring in an estimated $220k [per year](http://www.wastedive.com/news/update-michigan-becomes-seventh-state-to-outlaw-bag-bans/426773/))
* To reduce plastic bags in the environment to mitigate harmful environmental effects, such as the fact that plastic bags take [1,000 years to degrade](http://www.ewashtenaw.org/government/departments/environmental_health/recycling_home_toxics/carryout-bag-ordinance/Reusable%20Bag%20Ordinance%20Work%20Session%20PresentationFINAL.pdf)

3 potential arguments for the State level legislation:

**Plastic bag bans hurt business**
Los Angeles County California banned plastic bags and charged a $.10 fee for paper bags. They found a 100% reduction in plastic bags, a 25% reduction in paper bags and a [minimal impact on most businesses](http://ladpw.org/epd/aboutthebag/PDF/Bag%20Ban%20Status%20Nov%202012.pdf).

**The taxes are regressive, they hurt the poor more**
This one does have merit. An impact assessment concluded that an average family uses 720 plastic bags at grocery stores [per year](https://conservingnow.com/plastic-bag-consumption-facts/) 720 x .$10/bag = $72/year in taxes.

**Don't tell me what kind of bag to use!**
I think the crux of the argument really is personal freedom, ie, the ""don't tell me what kind of bag to use argument."" "

Do Mayors and County Boards Have the Authority to Pass and Enforce Business Closures and Mask Mandates? What Limits Exist for What Can be Instituted at a Hyper-local Level?,"As different parts of the country respond to COVID in their own unique way, many cities/counties have remained shut down or instituted mask mandates. I understand from another thread posted to this sub that states governors are expressly given the power to respond to public health crises as they see fit if the federal government has not instituted any sweeping measures.

[https://www.lawfareblog.com/quarantine-power-primer-light-coronavirus-situation](https://www.lawfareblog.com/quarantine-power-primer-light-coronavirus-situation)

Is this same power given to local governments in the absence of state-wide measures? Are there any legal parameters on what they are able to legislate/enforce, or is anything allowed so long as it doesn't violate federal/state constitutions?

Edit: Feeling the need to clarify that I am aware that the data is utterly unambiguous that masks are effective, and that mandating them seems a small matter when stacked up next to other temporary emergency measures like Japanese internment, WWII food rations, the PATRIOT act, etc. Yet these are almost always enacted at a state or federal level, not city or county, so I'm especially curious what systems are in place for endowing power to local government when more centralized government doesn't act, or conversely what limits are in place for such situations."

Evaluation of this criticism of Sanders' tax plan,"Just curious if anyone has come across this article: 


http://www.joshuakennon.com/thoughts-bernie-sanders-tax-economic-proposal/

From the perspective of someone without much formal background in tax or economics, it seems to bring up a lot of fair points: 

> ""An estimated 45% of the tax revenue Sanders wants to raise comes from these offensive and onerous levies on working families, not the rich alone.""

> ""if you are self-employed, before we’ve even gotten to the other tax changes he wants to make, you are now looking at sending more than 1/5th of your income to the Federal government and you still wouldn’t have paid a penny of Federal, state, or local income taxes, sales taxes, or property taxes.""
> 
> ""By the time all is said and done, even accounting for the supposed free college and health care that Sanders is promising his voters, the discretionary purchasing power of nearly every family in this country, rich and poor alike, would be lowered, in some cases by double-digit percentages.""


It's a bit of a long read (with a big ""preamble""), and there are many more criticisms than what I quoted here. 

So my question - are these legitimate, well-founded criticisms or is there some bias, hyperbole or exaggeration in here?"
[META] Please assume good faith and moderate your tone when commenting,"We've received a handful of messages from OPs who have left the sub as a result of the kinds of comments that they receive on their posts. As such, we'd like to take some time to look at good and bad ways to respond to posts. Even if you assume good faith already, I invite you to read this post so that you can help encourage it in the future.

In /r/NeutralPolitics, we believe that assuming good faith is **vital** to having good discussion. When someone posts something we disagree with, we find that the best way to deal with it is with a reasoned, fact based reaction, as opposed to an angry (even if fact based) reaction. Here are a few good guidelines for responding:

* Assume that OP misunderstands the issue before assuming willful ignorance or malice. Many people post here because they are unaware of the arguments against them, and want to find out what those are.
* Woo the OP to ""your side"", don't chastise them for holding an opinion you disagree with. You'll catch more flies with honey than with flame wars.
* Avoid *ad hominem* attacks. If your post contains a lot of ""I"" and ""You"", you're probably talking about the OP, not the issue. This is often a sign of a weak argument, since if you have a good argument, talking about the issue should be enough to persuade someone.
* Please do not use sarcasm or rhetorical questions. Rhetorical questions can only have negative consequences, they never contribute towards good dialogue. Sarcasm can only inflame, it can't inform.

Let's look at an example. Say I made a post about a controversial issue, like this:

>I think that the US should stop funding public education. Teachers get paid way too much and we need to reduce the debt. [sources about teacher salaries and the national debt]

Now, depending on your views, you may feel very angered by this admittedly poorly worded and simplistic post. Many top level comments would probably look like this:

>""I think that the US should stop funding public education."" Yeah, sure. And maybe we should stop paving roads while we're at it, since that would reduce the deficit too.

>""Teachers get paid way too much and we need to reduce the debt."" Teachers are paid a pittance [source]. If you think being a teacher is so easy, why don't you try being one?

When you have 20 replies like this in your inbox, it can be stressful to try and read through them and respond. Here's a much more constructive way to argue against the OP.

>Education is actually a pretty small part of the national budget [source]. Not to mention that American teachers are paid way less than teachers in other developed countries [source]. Studies [source] have shown that public education leads to a more skilled population that can better compete in a global marketplace. If Americans are earning more money, we can pay back the debt faster.

>Do you still feel that education is a waste of federal budget? If so, why?

Something to note here: After attempting to persuade the reader with their argument, this commenter invites honest feedback on whether they've been convincing, and allows the OP (or any reader) to change their view without shaming them for the views they may have held before. This is key.

There's already a lot of good faith discussion here, and it warms my cold, reasoned, fact-based blood-pump. Let's see more of it!"

"Besides goods, what can China export to maximize its global influence?""","Globalization is commonly viewed in respect to the spread of western values on other countries. In this sense, U.S. products and pop culture tend to infiltrate other markets and are perceived as being American values. (plenty of food, Hollywood and the perception it gives other countries about the U.S., consumerism)

It seems China's main goal is to spread its economic influence in other countries. The case of China's investments in Africa are a good example of this. [This opinion page](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/17/opinion/into-africa-chinas-wild-rush.html) gives an overview of China's investments and some of the negative effects it has led to. 

>In much of Africa, they have set up huge mining operations. They have also built infrastructure. But, with exceptions, they have done so using equipment and labor imported from home, without transferring skills to local communities. So China takes our primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism.”

The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/opinion/chinas-limited-influence.html) highlights some issues with Chinese soft power in its current state.

>In today’s media-driven world, soft power is another crucial element of superpower influence. Yet, beyond the inaccessibility of China’s language for most foreigners and their indifference to its social trends, China’s political and economic systems have little appeal in other countries. Its state capitalist economic model attracts political leaders looking to build wealth and micromanage markets, but it offers little for ordinary citizens.


Economic domination has played a huge role in maintain western supremacy, but cultural values have been a huge part of maintaining the status quo. The spread of english language has been a big factor in maintaining this as well, as it keeps the U.S. accessible to all countries. While the two are always linked, it's been hard to find articles that discuss the spread of Chinese culture, if there has been any.

Can Chinese culture compete with centuries of western influence? As the article mentioned language is probably the biggest barrier to spreading influence, but are there other ways? Have they taken any action to export values that are in contrast to western culture?  If not, are there values that would be beneficial in increasing Chinese soft power?"
Is the pace of President Trump's Cabinet appointments similar to those of previous administrations?,"According to this [tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/) from *The Washington Post*, 61 of 553 ""key executive branch positions"", all of which require Senate confirmation, have either a nominee awaiting confirmation, or are filled by a confirmed nominee. The feature shows that Trump sent 33 nominations to the Senate, higher than recent presidents, including Clinton and both Bushes, but lower than Obama. Since then, he has named 28 more to executive branch positions. This still leaves many departments without a Deputy Secretary named, including State, Labor, Interior, and Education. Is this typical of an administration in its first few months, or are lower-level positions (e.g. deputy and assistant secretaries) in Cabinet departments filled more quickly?"

What specific actions can the USDA now take to ensure meat production facilities remain open after the DPA executive order?,"[The White House has issued an Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-delegating-authority-dpa-respect-food-supply-chain-resources-national-emergency-caused-outbreak-covid-19/) relating to meat and poultry.  The stated goal of the order is to ensure that meat processing facilities remain open.  They have done so based on the [Defense Production Act](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1650-20490-5258/final__defense_production_act_091030.pdf), specifically, section 101 and 101(b).

What specific powers and processes does designating food products as critical infrastructure grant the federal government?

1. Can the government begin ordering meat via a [rated order](https://www.fema.gov/information-contractors-about-priority-rated-orders)?
2. Can the government force plants to reopen that had voluntarily closed?

4. Can the DPA override state and local laws regarding pandemic procedures?  An earlier [discussion relating to social distancing here argues not](https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-federal-government-override-state-government-rules-social-distancing-promote-economy), but it is not exactly the same scenario.

Additionally, does the [liability provision in DPA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4557) automatically shield any meat processing companies from liability if they endanger workers by exposing them to unnecessary risk of infection?

In the United States, the situation isn't the same, but privacy advocates still have cause to worry.  According to the Supreme Court, the [third party doctrine](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-third-party-doctrine/282721/) dictates that if an individual willfully releases private information to a third party, the government doesn't require a warrant to access said information because their is no expectation of privacy on the individual's part. Nonetheless, ten states have privacy rights outlined in their constitutions, as shown [here](http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/privacy-protections-in-state-constitutions.aspx) by the national conference of state legislatures.  The right to privacy, as [currently outlined in the common law](https://www.livescience.com/37398-right-to-privacy.html), also influences abortion policy.

What does a fundamental right to privacy entail? Is it public, private, or does sit somewhere in between?  If it is codified in the Constitution, should Congress, the States or both be granted enforcement power?  Why should, or shouldn't, we include a right to privacy in the U.S Constitution?"

"What are some arguments for and against the US's decision to spend so much on defense, and have military bases around the world?","The US spends as much on its military as do the next 8 countries (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, France, UK, India and Germany).

How does Congress approve funding for specific projects by organizations like the CIA?,"Reposting with a few sources this time,

I am not sure if I am asking in the correct subreddit. I was debating on asking this question here or on /r/AskHistorians. But to me, it seemed more of a political question than a historical one.

In Steve Coll's book, ""Ghost Wars"", there are multiple instances of Congress debating on increasing or cutting the CIA's funding toward the fighting between the Soviets and the mujahedin fighters in Afghanistan in early 70s and 80s. Seemingly all without the public knowing at the time.

Will Article 17 (previously 13) of the EU Copyright Directive require platforms to implement upload filters?,"With EU elections coming up, heated discussions on the EU Copyright Directive have begin to take place again. They're often centered around Article 17 (previously 13), which will allegedly oblige content platforms such as reddit or youtube to implement upload filters for content, or be liable for any copyright infringements. ^[1](https://www.cnet.com/news/article-13-eu-countries-approve-copyright-directive/) ^[2](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18280726/europe-copyright-directive) Some EU legislators have defended the directive, saying there is no requirement for upload filters. ^[3](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20190111IPR23225/questions-and-answers-on-issues-about-the-digital-copyright-directive) 

The following are the parts of the directive which I believe to be most relevant to the question of upload filters: 

>4 . If no authorisation is granted, online content-sharing service providers shall be liable for unauthorised acts of communication to the public, including making available to the public, of copyright-protected works and other subject matter, unless the service providers demonstrate that they have: 

>(a) made best efforts to obtain an authorisation, and 

>(b) made, in accordance with high industry standards of professional diligence, best efforts to ensure the unavailability of specific works and other subject matter for which the rightholders have provided the service providers with the relevant and necessary information; and in any event [...] 

... 

>8 . *The application of this Article shall not lead to any general monitoring obligation.* 

>Member States shall provide that online content-sharing service providers provide rightholders, at their request, with adequate information on the functioning of their practices with regard to the cooperation referred to in paragraph 4 and, where licensing agreements are concluded between service providers and rightholders, information on the use of content covered by the agreements. 

For full context, [here is the directive](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-8-2019-0231_EN.html).

Obamacare [was modeled on](https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8311.pdf) a state law program implemented in Massachusetts by Governor Mitt Romney, so there's some precedent for state-level reforms there.

What are the consequences of this bill?  Can this lead to the US being sued in foreign courts, as some suggest?

Because for months I can tell you I've been giving speeches on public policy and nobody paid a lot of attention. And the minute I mentioned anything personal about Donald Trump the media cut in live to my speeches hoping I would say more of it. So then they could go on the air and say, ""oh this is so sad,"" subtitle, 'we're going to keep giving it coverage because its good for our ratings.' 

>So I think we need as a, the media needs to examine the role it's played in creating this atmosphere, because I know it's good for ratings, but it's really detrimental to our political culture. And uh, and to our country at large

How much does it cost to cover someone under the ACA vs. the newly proposed health care law?,"[According to the latest CBO report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cbo-latest-house-gop-health-care-bill-would-mean-as-many-uninsured-by-2026/2017/03/23/cb507fce-0f4d-11e7-ab07-07d9f521f6b5_story.html), the ACA repeal will cut the federal deficit by $150 billion over 10 years and cause 24 million more Americans to be uninsured.

Some simple calculations:

$150 billion over 10 years = $15 billion per year

$15 billion / 24 million uninsured = $625 saved per person per year

Obviously this is an estimate. But supposing that it's at least roughly correct, can this be interpreted as saying that it would cost the US government $625 to insure one of those individuals for a year? This strikes me as relatively cheap, considering that [monthly premiums are roughly $393 for individuals](https://www.zanebenefits.com/blog/bid/97380/faq-how-much-does-individual-health-insurance-cost) -- so cheap that I think my line of reasoning must be flawed.

Of course, this is assuming that everyone who loses insurance was previously getting it at no cost (to them) through Medicaid. This doesn't seem like a stretch considering that [tens of millions of people are enrolled in it](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/02/24/medicaid-enrollment-surges-across-the-us).

I'm aware this isn't a very nuanced analysis, but I still feel like I must be overlooking something crucial.

"In an article this week, the NYT attributes Trump's popularity to poor voters' belief that the Republican Party has failed to represent their interests.

> Most of these [working-class] voters had long since given up on an increasingly liberal and cosmopolitan Democratic Party.

---
> Between 2008 and 2012, according to the Pew Research Center, more lower-income and less-educated white voters shifted their allegiance to Republicans.
These voters had fled the Democratic Party and were angry at Mr. Obama, whom they believed did not have their interests at heart. But not all of them were deeply conservative; many did not think about politics in ideological terms at all. A 2011 Pew survey called them the “Disaffecteds.”

The first point suggests that these voters aligned themselves with the Republicans for social or cultural reasons, while the second implies that the Democratic Party has actually done an even poorer job of representing the interests of poor voters. To what extent are these claims true? Have the Democrats similarly failed to represent the economic interests of these voters? Or did they have other reasons for continuing to vote Republican?"

The average increase would be around $9000 per household, though that mainly comes from the highest earners in America paying the most with the average increase for the middle class would be around 4700.

http://taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/2000638-an-analysis-of-hillary-clintons-tax-proposals.pdf

Comparing it to Hillary's plan that Urban-Brookings reviewed yesterday, her plan raises a lot less overall at 1.1 trillion over the decade, but has less of an effect on the average american overall compared to Bernie's in taxes. The bottom 95% of taxplayers would see little change, while the top 5% would see large increases, though less overall than in Sanders' plan.

So what do you think of the analysis? Bernie has argued that his tax increases will be offset by what it will pay for, but will voters go for that, especially given how many economists split on his plan. Will they accept Hillary's plan that is less ambitious, but not cost or raise as much money? And how may this effect the general election for either candidate?"

"The Democratic Party in Maine essentially abolished superdelegates recently.

The resolution also encouraged the national party to do the same. 

According to the linked article, the change is an effort to make the nomination process more democratic, and to give younger, less influential voters more power over a process currently dominated by entrenched party elites. However, [others point out]( http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/mar/22/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-superdelegates-never/) that superdelegates are rarely the deciding factor in a nomination, and that a bloc disconnected from the popular voting process act as an important counter to momentary populist movements that may nominate politicians that are not viable in the general election.

It should be noted that the Republican Party [also makes use of superdelegates in its nomination process]( http://www.bustle.com/articles/141611-does-the-gop-have-superdelegates-the-republican-partys-nomination-rules-are-different-this-year), though they are much smaller in number and autonomy than their Democratic counterparts.

The US government has shut down. Let's discuss.,"Neutrons,

There have been many submissions in the last 24 hours about the [US government shutdown,](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/congress-shutdown-debate.html?_r=0) but none of them conformed to [this subreddit's guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), so they got removed.

Here's a post with the best points from each. Please try to keep the discussion civil.

There's a lot of arguing about who is at fault for the shutdown. In the interest of neutrality, I think it's fair to say there's plenty of blame to go around *(edit: there's been some contention on this point, so [here's is a better explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1nio4r/the_us_government_has_shut_down_lets_discuss/ccizswk?context=1) of the reasoning)*, so instead, let's explore what the different forces hoped to accomplish by letting it get to this point and whether they have succeeded. [Who stands to gain and lose](http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/09/23/20663446-obama-cruz-among-those-who-could-benefit-from-shutdown?lite) from the shutdown, both politically and in the general population? And what does the evidence suggest about the long-term effects of this event?

Is it reasonable for the people to pursue removal or recall of legislators who failed to appropriate funds in time to avoid a shutdown of the government? How might they go about that?

Is there a real possibility that the government could [fail to raise the debt ceiling next month,](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/how-a-debt-ceiling-crisis-could-become-a-financial-crisis/) leading to a US default on its debt obligations?

Can anyone provide me with reliably sourced 2016 election statistics,"I wanted to know, if everybody who didn't vote in the 2016 election had voted for a third party candidate, or an independent candidate, would they have won instead.

I can't be bothered to figure this out state by state, so going by total numbers (which is clearly not perfect due to Clinton winning the popular vote); Clinton received 65,844,610 votes. Trump received 62,979,636 votes. Source:

https://splinternews.com/here-is-the-final-popular-vote-count-of-the-2016-electi-1793864349

I then discovered there was a difference between total number of registered voters (people who can vote) and total number of people who could hypothetically vote (if they register).

I decided to try and find the total number of registered voters first. 

Which brings us to now. After dismissing a few sources because they were vague in their definitions, and their numbers were surprisingly high (i assumed they were giving me the total number of voting age people who could hypothetically vote if registered). I found two seemingly credible sources for numbers:

https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/how-many-registered-voters-are-in-america-2016-229993

That source explicitly says registered voters in late 2016 was just over 200m.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/273743/number-of-registered-voters-in-the-united-states/

And that source gives the number specifically for the 2016 election at 157m.

I thought maybe the first source was the number that registered after the election, but the second source gives the number of registered voters at the 2018 elections at 153m. I doubt the number went from 157 to 200 to 153 in two years.

Which of these sources are known to be reliable or unreliable? As you can see it would make the difference regarding my original question, whether the number of people who could, but didn't, vote, would have made a difference.

Or which alternate sources are known to be reliable or unreliable?

(This is clearly being cheeky, but if anyone wants to do the work for me and source your findings, that'd work too...?)

Please help :-)

Edit: thank you so much for the answers so far. I'm sure i can figure out the answer to my question from here. Kinda busy tonight though, but I'll sort through all those sources when i have some time. Especially thanks to u/leonkennedy74 I'm going to be giving some thought to how possible this hypothesis actually is in the current system.

Edit 2: The reason i started where i did is from a statement i made, and then tried to find out if it's true; that if everyone who could have voted did, but for a third party candidate, we'd now have a three party system.

But the boring answer to that is that the current system wouldn't allow that sort of a sudden massive swing into three parties :-("
What are the arguments for/against the regulation of service-animals?,"[Service animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_animal) have long been used by persons to assist with disabilities, both physical and mental. In the United States, there is no official registry of service animals. Per [ADA rules](https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm), companies are limited to questions they may ask regarding service animals:

> When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person’s disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.

A recent situation is when emotional support animals are being claimed as being applicable under the ADA. These emotional support animals are not required to be trained, which has led to several incidents, most notably with regards to air travel where emotional support animals are exempted from pet travel fees and storage restrictions.


[Emotional support dog attacks man on plane.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/05/29/an-emotional-support-dog-attacked-him-flight-hes-suing-delta-owner/?utm_term=.fd19627a59ee)

These laws have even been used to bring non-traditional ADA animals on air travel, such as a [live turkey](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/01/15/someone-just-used-a-federal-law-to-bring-a-live-turkey-on-a-delta-flight/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.ba78f0665b09).


[Accommodating service animals is also an issue for landlords](https://archives.hud.gov/news/2013/servanimals_ntcfheo2013-01.pdf), who are required by the ADA to accommodate service animals despite the landlord having an otherwise no-pet policy, which can include emotional support animals. However, it is [incredibly easy to get an animal certified as an emotional support animal](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animals-and-us/201406/service-animal-scams-growing-problem), to the extent that you can get a certificate over the internet for less than a hundred dollars.


Those opposed to increased regulations of service-animals present the argument that creating such a system [would be detrimental to the disabled](https://blog.easterseals.com/illinois-service-dog-law-hb-3162/).

> Not all individuals with a disability have easy access to a medical doctor, and some cannot afford a visit to a medical doctor. A person with a diagnosed seizure disorder, for example, might not see a doctor regularly and making a doctor’s appointment just to get an official letter could be expensive.

> The requirement to get this license and equipment to identify an animal as a service dog. What costs fall upon the individual with the disability (a fee to apply, the cost of a vest or harness that is specially made)? What costs are required of the taxpayer to fund someone to test dogs and hand out licenses? Cost and confidentiality for the person with the disability is a huge concern – and one the ADA intended to avoid as it does not require medical documentation or vests for dogs.

> The obedience and skills required are too subjective

[The costs of owning a service animal are significant](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/health/22patient.html), and roughly seventy percent percent of disabled persons are unemployed, so even small increases in cost can put a service animal out of reach of many disabled persons who could benefit from them. There are also [many different roles and types of service animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistance_dog), and it would be hard to encapsulate all the useful benefits of service animals in a standardized certification process."

"The ""Conservatives vs. Liberals"" opposition outside of US politics","When discussing American politics, I've seen people addressing the dichotomy of ""Conservatives vs. Liberals"", [treating them as opposing forces](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/head-games/201702/why-liberals-and-conservatives-think-so-differently).

However, in the country I live in (Brazil), it's not rare to see conservatives and liberals ""playing for the same team"": one of the presidential candidates, João Amoedo,  said he was ""[liberal na economia, conservador nos costumes](https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,joao-amoedo-se-diz-liberal-na-economia-mas-conservador-nos-costumes,70002318886)"", which means that he supports economic liberalism and conservative moral values. The big dichotomy here is between right and left, where both liberalism and conservatism are (usually) treated as positions in the right part of the spectrum\*, whereas the left (usually) rejects (at least one of) them.

I try coming up with analogies in order to understand, say, ""which side is which"" when following US politics: the liberals are the equivalent to the left and the conservatives, to the right...? My experience with my country's politics **heavily** contradicts this, as I already explained, but I try working with this view anyway.

As if it wasn't confusing enough, I then began following discussions in American leftists circles (mostly in Facebook) and I learned that most of them are strongly against not only conservatives but liberals too, as [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/magazine/hated-by-the-right-mocked-by-the-left-who-wants-to-be-liberal-anymore.html) addresses, which lead me to write this post. This position of the left makes sense when approaching the subject from the world view of my country's politics, where they're often seen as parts (not necessarily in agreement, but still) of the same side, but it doesn't make any sense when talking specifically about the US, where both are frequently seen as parts of a dichotomy.

So, I ask: Who/what exactly is this dichotomy addressing? Can it be adequately juxtaposed to a left-right dichotomy?

&#x200B;

\*I am not implying that they always come together, (in fact, Instituto Liberal, the ""Liberal Institute"", published an article saying that [there is no such thing as a liberal conservative](https://www.institutoliberal.org.br/blog/nao-existe-liberal-conservador-2/) as Amoedo suggested) just that they're both seen as part of the right"
What are the pros and cons of continuing austerity programs (e.g. Greece)?,"This summer has seen extreme weather, in particular extended heat waves and wildfires, across the globe- including Europe, South Asia, Japan, and the United States. Leading experts believe such concetrations of extreme weather are 'the face of climate change' as [Prof. Michael Mann of Penn State University says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann).

This week saw deadly wildfires near Athens, with close to a hundred dead and widespread damage. The government has [received criticism for its response](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/greece-wildfires-firefighters-attack-government-response), including from Greece's Federation of Firefighters. Within that story is an argument that the loss of life was influenced by Greek's austerity programs:

>Echoing Varoufakis’s argument that austerity inflicted on Greece had also played a role in the inability of authorities to respond effectively to the disaster, Stathopoulos admitted that budget cuts had rendered at least 30% of the service’s fire engines useless. The debt-stricken country has applied the tough measures in return for bailout loans to keep bankruptcy at bay.

>“About 15% of our fleet of 1,750 trucks are off the roads because they have chronic problems and are old,” he said. “Another 15% are in need of spare parts which we can’t afford. As firefighters we take an oath to protect people and their properties. We know when to recommend that areas be evacuated, but for some reason our recommendation was not heard. This is a huge tragedy for our country and apologies are owed.”

**Austerity, the process of reducing the deficit (and perhaps the debt) of a state through tax increases and budget cuts,** has been a common theme of post-Great Recession Europe. Greece has had an unusually long, severe austerity regime running, approaching a decade and length ([see the latter part of the BBC's timeline of Greek history](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17373216)). The European Union, in its negotiations with Greece, have demanded cuts to the fire service that led to its budget being [reduced almost a quarter from 2009 levels](https://phys.org/news/2018-07-greek-tragedy-suprise.html).

Austerity has been promoted by many establishment officials and economists. A famous academic study by Reinhart and Rogoff of Harvard found that high national debt inhibited growth. While some of their underlying math has since been challenged, [there is a substantial community that believes their findings are still true](https://www.ft.com/content/2df58ce0-a8ba-11e2-bcfb-00144feabdc0) and support austerity programs.

The evidence of austerity being an effective strategy for debt is contentious. Two economists for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization known for advocating austerity through 'structural adjustment', [released an article saying that neoliberalism](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2016/06/ostry.htm), the ideology under which austerity is advocated as a solution, is 'oversold'. In part:

>However, there are aspects of the neoliberal agenda that have not delivered as expected. Our assessment of the agenda is confined to the effects of two policies: removing restrictions on the movement of capital across a country’s borders (so-called capital account liberalization); and fiscal consolidation, sometimes called “austerity,” which is shorthand for policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels. An assessment of these specific policies (rather than the broad neoliberal agenda) reaches three disquieting conclusions:

>•The benefits in terms of increased growth seem fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries.­

>•The costs in terms of increased inequality are prominent. Such costs epitomize the trade-off between the growth and equity effects of some aspects of the neoliberal agenda.­

>•Increased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth. Even if growth is the sole or main purpose of the neoliberal agenda, advocates of that agenda still need to pay attention to the distributional effects.­

There are numerous proposed alternatives to austerity as currently practiced (though [some commentators have insisted that there is in fact, no alternative](https://www.ft.com/content/7864786c-92aa-11e1-b6e2-00144feab49a)). The Guardian [compiled ten proposals from across the spectrum](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/alternatives-austerity-ideas-across-spectrum) in regards to the United Kingdom's austerity program, which began around the 2010 election.

What are the arguments for/against raising the national social security retirement age past the planned amounts?,"[Some argue](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/yes-actually-raising-retirement-age-good-idea) that raising the social security retirement age makes fiscal sense with people living longer and baby boomers retiring.

[Life expectancy continues to net increase](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=US&name_desc=true) over the last decade. This means that the elderly are living longer and longer. At retirement age, this means they get benefits for a longer time.

What new information about links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign have we learned from the Mueller report?,"In [his report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf)^1 released with redactions today, Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller said:

Russian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J.
Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence
service conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers
working on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also
identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although
the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump
presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit  electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not
establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian
government in its election interference activities.^2

What does the CLOUD Act do?,"The CLOUD (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data) Act is an act [proposed by Senators Hatch, Graham, Coons and Whitehouse](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data) on [February 6th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act)

The bill itself can be found online [here](https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/s2383/BILLS-115s2383is.pdf), and is not that long of a read. The gist of the bill is that it is amending the Stored Communications Act to fix problems that the proponents claim are in American internet-related laws. 

[Andrew Woods and Peter Swire writing at Lawfare Blog](https://lawfareblog.com/cloud-act-welcome-legislative-fix-cross-border-data-problems) support the legislation, saying things like 

>Moreover, a number of safeguards are built into the bill. The bill creates a mechanism whereby providers can apply for a motion to quash or modify legal process if the provider reasonably believes the subscriber is not a U.S. person and that the required disclosure would create a material risk that the provider would violate the laws of a qualifying foreign government. It also requires a court to conduct a comity analysis in the event of such a motion to quash, which may alleviate foreign government concerns about sovereign interests. It is not clear why this comity provision is in the statute except as a symbolic gesture; courts were already free under the common law to conduct a comity analysis in thinking through whether to issue an order with extraterritorial impact. Its presence in the statute is perhaps a reminder that trust and mutual respect play an important role in these cross-border matters. 

The EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation - [opposes the bill](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), stating its issues with the law: 

>The Clarifying Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act expands American and foreign law enforcement’s ability to target and access people’s data across international borders in two ways. First, the bill creates an explicit provision for U.S. law enforcement (from a local police department to federal agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to access “the contents of a wire or electronic communication and any record or other information” about a person regardless of where they live or where that information is located on the globe. In other words, U.S. police could compel a service provider—like Google, Facebook, or Snapchat—to hand over a user’s content and metadata, even if it is stored in a foreign country, without following that foreign country’s privacy laws.

Many people consider nationalism to be [xenophobic and hate filled](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/08/the-guardian-view-on-hungarys-election-europe-faces-a-grassroots-fight), in countries such as [Saudi Arabia](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/saudi-arabia-nationalism-driving-ban-salman/561845/), nationalism is thought to be a reason behind the silencing of opposing view points, including the most recent [death of a journalist](https://thinkprogress.org/saudi-arabia-media-narratives-khashoggi-killing-absolve-kingdom-7d54297090bc/).

On the flip side, such groups as the [Scottish National Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party) are advocating for independence from Britain to rejoin the EU in the wake of Brexit.  Others have [claimed things](https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/08/is-nationalism-good-for-you/) such as lower corruption, wealthier economies, and fostering a concern for other citizens.

With Donald Trump recently [declaring himself a nationalist](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-declares-himself-a-nationalist-while-stumping-for-ted-cruz-2018-10), what are the potential benefits and dangers of a revitalized nationalist movement in the United States?  Especially given the number of white nationalist groups that support the current administration, such as those at the [Unite the Right rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally).  Does the form of nationalism that Donald Trump supports capture the benefits of a nationalist society?

And further, how do the ideas of Nationalism compare with the [""traditional"" viewpoints of the GOP party](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/2012-republican-party-platform), such as [Federalism](https://reason.com/blog/2017/02/23/do-conservatives-still-care-about-federa) and [Free Trade](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/reagan-embraced-free-trade-immigration)?

What are some things we could do to prevent the next pandemic?,"I looked up the research on the risk of emerging diseases, and found this source on the subject. It has over 2,200 citations, and it was the most thorough analysis I could find, since it looked at all harmful pathogens in humans, and also which have emerged recently, and what their characteristics were.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088493/

The paper finds that 75% of emerging diseases are zoonotic, meaning they are able to transmit from animals to humans, virus’s especially so.

What have governments done in the past to contain the spread of zoonotic pathogens from being transmitted to humans initially? Has there been attempts to create a pandemic/emerging disease prevention policy, rather than a mitigation policy? Have there been any governmental agencies that have had forums or policy discussions around this topic, even if they have never taken any actionable steps? If they did consider an actionable step but did not take it, what were their concerns?

Thank you."
How do different countries balance military order with due process rights of soldiers accused of misconduct?,"Today in [a major ruling,](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/17891/index.do) the Supreme Court of Canada rejected 5-2 a challenge to the country's military justice system for failing to provide jury trials to soldiers accused of serious crimes in Canada.^1

I want to use this as a springboard to understand better how military justice and civilian justice interplay in different countries.

In particular:

* What schemes have been developed in different countries for dealing with ordinary or off-duty crimes by members of the military when stationed in their home country?

* What systems have been developed, or problems arisen, related to soldiers stationed outside their home countries who commit ordinary crimes?

* What protections of due process are generally found in military courts, versus what protections are forfeit?

Could a wealthy enough President just pay for large public work initiatives by him/herself?,"In a recent budget fight, the White House asked for [$5 billion for border wall funding.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-continues-to-demand-5-billion-for-border-wall-as-shutdown-looms/2018/11/26/f2ff5868-f1d4-11e8-aeea-b85fd44449f5_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b1db109edc34)

Although this recent shutdown fight is not fully resolved yet, it appears the [White House is backing down](https://www.apnews.com/5066e19874654968a3c99920ade7c544) from the $5 billion demand. 

Estimates for completing construction on an entire wall run much higher than $5 billion, and [stretch from](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-border-wall-billions-unseen-costs-gao-report-2018-8) about $25 billion to $70 billion.

---

I have 3 questions about this:

1: For the short term budget fight and the $5 billion - Could the President just put up the money himself, or are there roadblocks from the government accepting the money, either in regards to earmarking or something else?

2: Does the answer to Question 1 change if the President doesn't just put up a portion of the money, but literally every penny needed to complete and maintain the project? 

3: A GoFundMe has been set up for [the border wall](https://www.caller.com/story/news/texasregion/2018/12/18/trump-border-wall-gofundme-crowdfunding-campaign-launched-florida-veteran/2352522002/) - can this be earmarked for specific use in constructing the wall?

How would the US federal government ban a website without requiring a new law from Congress?,"# Questions

What is the most likely or most viable way that the US federal government could ban a website (or app) without requiring a new law from Congress?

What challenges would that ban face?

Bonus question: What tends to be the threshold(s) that a Chinese owned company must exceed (% of Chinese ownership, activities, proof of censorship, proof of embedded CCP members, etc) for that company or their products to receive sanction-like actions from the US that go beyond standard regulations?

# Context

US White House administration confirmed that WeChat and TikTok [are each facing scrutiny in the US](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/wechat-backlash-us/) and the administration is threatening to ban them.

Every major internet censorship initiative that I know of at the national level [are acts of congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States#Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act_(CFAA)).

Even the best explanations I can find about how a ban would work cast significant doubt on any options that do not need congressional approval:

* US Commerce Department could put TikTok on its [""entity"" list](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entity-list)  but the US government blocking traffic to TikTok is ""unlikely to succeed given our legal systems.""
*  The administration has limited authority to ban outright any specific piece of software, like an app. EFF general council says ""There is no law that would authorize the federal government to ban ordinary American from using an app.""
* A law or executive order that targets TikTok could spur a challenge under the First Amendment using rulings such as [Bernstein v. DOJ](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech), in which the court found a computer scientist had the First Amendment right to publish an encryption algorithm. 
* ""The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is [already investigating TikTok](https://www.cnet.com/news/us-launches-a-national-security-review-of-tiktok-report/) for national security concerns...could end up requiring changes to TikTok's substantial operations inside the US."" But that started in November 2019, and its not clear to me when that wraps up and what impact it can have in the grand scheme of things.

EDIT: Clarified I meant blocking a website or app"
"Guidelines and Laws surrounding Special Forces Identies, Operational Security.","During President Trump's recent ""surprise visit"" to the troops on Iraq he apparently took photos and video where [""the White House communications team revealed that a U.S. Navy SEAL team was deployed to Iraq ... [And] did not shield the faces of special operation forces""](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-navy-seal-iraq-video-1272102) when posted to social media.  This is reportedly out of step with traditional precautions, has dangerous repercussions for them in field,  and in the case of the Newsweek article claims that this information is ""classified""  and a ""closely held secret"". 

I'm looking to answer the following questions:

1. How accurate is this reporting?
2. What are the rules surrounding Identies of Special Forces generally, and specifically the Navy Seals?
3. Would the president posting classified information online automatically declassify it, and does he have the absolute autonomy to do so?
4. Is there a real danger to Operational Security from Trump's actions?"

Could a President declare a National Emergency for the climate change?,"I saw that there is a thread going right now for a similar question regarding ""gun control""- but my understanding from that thread is that Gun Control is more of a legislative issue than a funding issue, and that National Emergencies primarily give the authority to maneuver funds around, not create laws.

My question is whether or not a President could legally declare a national emergency on climate change and then proceed to divert budgetary funding towards things like green technology, and away from things like oil drilling and military spending on tanks and humvees.

My last post was automatically removed because I neglected to provide a source- so here's an article that says Oregon Congressman Earl Blumenauer has suggested the idea:

"What started the investigation(s) into the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and what charges have the police already recommended against him?

> Mr. Netanyahu railed against a corruption investigation into his dealings with several Israeli media tycoons that is widely expected to culminate soon in an indictment on bribery and other criminal charges.

> The investigation was “biased,” Mr. Netanyahu complained. He demanded an opportunity to confront the state’s witnesses, on television, before any potential trial, so all Israelis “will know the whole truth.”

One of Netanyahu's allies has suggested he was being framed by the Israeli Ministry of Justice:

> Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition chief, David Amsalem, recently suggested that the prime minister was being framed and that “millions of people won’t accept this.”

I have a few questions:

1: What started the most recent investigation into Benjamin Netanyahu, and more generally, other corruption investigations?

2: Exactly what charges have been laid out against Netanyahu and his allies?

3: Is there any evidence the prosecutors and the Israeli Ministry of Justice hold an unworkable bias against Netanyahu or are 'framing' him?

What are the substantive merits or detriments of Trump's economic worldview as outlined in his recent interview?,"The Economist [published the full transcript of its interview with President Trump](http://www.economist.com/Trumptranscript?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/transcriptinterviewwithdonaldtrump) (Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was also present). The vast majority of the interview centres around the economy, specifically Trump's economic worldview and his intentions regarding policy.

Using the interview as the basis for the leader in this week's edition of the magazine The Economist[ takes a very dim view](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721904-impulsiveness-and-shallowness-americas-president-threaten-economy-well-rule) of what it calls ""Trumponomics""

Without detailed and scored spending plans it is, of course, hard to fully assess the Trump's policies. However, the interview is broad and I think shows enough of Trump's thinking to allow one to take a view. 

In view of this, I was curious as to what the potential benefits and downsides of his economic policies/plans/thinking, would be? And whether they are politically feasible would congress  allow him to go as far as he seems to want to? "
How effectively does the new Trump executive order on travel avoid court rulings against the old executive order?,"Today, [Donald Trump released a new executive order on travel](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/travel-ban-muslim-trump.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) ([text here](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/trump-new-travel-ban-executive-order-full-text/)) which is meant to supersede the order [he put forward on Jan 27.](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/02/01/2017-02281/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states)

What does the latest Politico article on Hillary campaign's fundraising mean?,"I'm seeing wildly different stories based on which sub I go to. [This Politico article](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/clinton-fundraising-leaves-little-for-state-parties-222670) describes what they found after looking at where the money goes.

On the one hand:

> According to the agreements signed by the participating committees, which were obtained by POLITICO, the money is required to be distributed, at least initially, based on a formula set forth in joint fundraising agreements signed by the participants. The first $2,700 goes to Clinton campaign, the next $33,400 goes to the DNC, and any remaining funds are to be distributed among the state parties.

And then directly the next paragraph:

> But what happens to the cash after that initial distribution is left almost entirely to the discretion of the Clinton campaign. Its chief operating officer Beth Jones is the treasurer of the victory fund. And FEC filings show that within a day of most transfers from the victory fund to the state parties, identical sums were transferred from the state party accounts to the DNC, which Sanders’ supporters have accused of functioning as an adjunct of the Clinton campaign.

So I'm pretty confused. The [Bernie campaign](https://berniesanders.com/press-release/politico-exposes-clinton-campaign-money-laundering-scheme/) and [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/4hifll/politico_exposes_clinton_campaign_money/) is predictably saying that this is evidence for corruption and is illegal. Hillary [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hillaryclinton/comments/4hikmd/bernie_sanders_official_website_is_now_accusing/) is saying that Bernie has the same arrangement just never donated money to DNC, and that Bernie received money from abroad for the campaign.

So what is going on? How will this effect the campaign?"

What are the pros and cons of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the way it's been managed by Director Richard Cordray,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in 2011 by Dodd-Frank, and was the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren.

According to its web site, the CFPB's ""central mission...is to make markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americans—whether they are applying for a mortgage, choosing among credit cards, or using any number of other consumer financial products"".

My questions are:

1. What, more specifically, does this mean the CFPB actually does?

2. What is the opposition to the CFPB based on?

3. What evidence is there that the CFPB has been succeeding or failing in its mission so far?

4. How has Richard Cordray managed the agency?

Thank you all! Edit: I just realized I forgot a question mark in the title so just pretend that's there. "

What exactly is the Justice Department policy on releasing investigative material that doesn't lead to criminal charges? Did the release of Clinton FBI interview 302s establish precedent for what the Justice Department will release?,"The current Attorney General, William Barr, has said he will [follow Justice Department guidelines](https://www.lawfareblog.com/william-barrs-remarkable-non-commitments-about-mueller-report) in regards to what information should be released to the public from any Mueller report. That citation notes that Barr will have a lot of discretion for deciding what to release depending on what he believes is in the public interest.

Competing with disclosure in the public interest is the [Justice Department guideline](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-22/democrats-demand-full-disclosure-as-mueller-is-poised-to-report) that: 

> ..frowns on releasing evidence of wrongdoing by people who haven’t been charged.

---

The Justice Department has at times released evidence directly relating to an investigation that did not produce any criminal charges. 

For example, the Justice Department and FBI [released interview summary reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi.html) (commonly called 302s) for people charged with no crimes in the Hillary Clinton email investigation. 

In handing these interview summary 302 reports over, the Justice Department was [complying with a Congressional House request](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-send-clinton-interview-notes-congress-n631206) for information.

---

I have a couple questions:

1: What exactly is the Justice Department policy on releasing investigative evidence when no criminal charges are filed? Is it well codified?

2: House Republicans successfully petitioned the Justice Department for 302 interview summary reports even though no charges were filed in the Clinton email case. Is this now established precedent, and will the Justice Department  have to hand over similar information in regards to the Mueller investigation?

What are Donald Trump's views on LGBT rights?,"In the wake of the election I've seen conflicting things on Reddit and social media about Donald Trump's views on the LGBT community.

This is the only article I've read on his stance:

Can anyone provide some more sources on Trump's views and stances on LGBT rights?"
What is the neutral approach to addressing sexual assault allegations made against both Bill Clinton and Donald Trump?,"Something I want to get out of the way right off the bat: There is no neutral approach to the act of sexual assault - It is an egregious crime and accusations of such should be taken seriously.

That being said - the past 48 hours have featured as many as ten women, through various news outlets ([Politico](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-new-york-times-allegations-229705), [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0)), accusing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as a sexual assailant, in various forms.

Per usual, even these allegations have seen reactions along party lines (unfortunately), and while many jump to the defense of Trump due to various reasons, many more have simply convicted him in the court of public opinion.

Here's my question: These allegations, both in the case of Donald Trump and in former president and known-philanderer Bill Clinton, consist of multiple variables that would make them somewhat difficult to prosecute - specifically time. Many of these women are 40, 50, 60+ years old and are speaking on incidents that allegedly happened years ago.

Is there a statute of limitations on these crimes? What sort of evidence would be necessary to actually label one of these men a sexual predator? Would Donald Trump have a libel case against any of these accusers should they lack a preponderance of evidence?

Most importantly - who has the burden of proof in these scenarios? Is it on the accused to prove innocence in the face of countless accusations that no doubt have a timely element? Or do we place the burden on the accuser - who likely has been through a mental struggle in their path to facing these crimes?

Here is a [lengthy piece](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/campuses-sexual-misconduct/487505/) from *The Atlantic* concerning the particular issue in relation to a US ewlated case, *'Doe v. Lhamon'*"
"In light of the election in Pakistan, what are some different ways states have addressed a powerful military that often intervenes politically?","Amidst high levels of violence, directed at both politicians and civilians, Pakistan [held an election](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/pakistan-elections-2018-latest-updates-180724055555410.html) that seems to indicate Imran Khan's PTI has won, albeit not a majority. This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.

There exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military. Shamila Chaudhary, who was an official under the Obama administration and now is an adviser at Johns Hopkins, [describes](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632673383/opinion-imran-khan-has-declared-victory-in-pakistans-election-but-the-military-w?t=1532734461945): 

>But the legitimacy of Khan's government will undoubtedly be questioned for the duration of his tenure. Ironically, in shaping the political environment to favor Khan, the establishment has effectively handicapped its own candidate.

>With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.

>The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.

Pakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016. [One study found 475 attempted coups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/22/map-the-world-of-coups-since-1950/?utm_term=.9cb00a51d2b6) worldwide since 1950, with about half succeeding- though not all coups are conducted by the military.

**How have states dealt differently with this instability and the balance between military and civilian power?** Some states have had decades since their last coup, others have had them in the last few years. There is a process whereby militaries can have expanded or limited powers, with varying levels of success. An example is in Indonesia, where the military has historically had its own business holdings that provided revenue independent of the national budget. The [process of civilian regulation is complicated and incomplete](http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/whats-the-indonesian-militarys-business/)."
"What would be the pros and cons of transferring all current public, government run roads, into the hands of private ownership?","[Private roads, otherwise known as free-market roads,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_roads) is a system of roads that are owned entirely by private companies and entities.

According to Freedom Economic Education, they claim that [free market roads would help end congestion](https://fee.org/articles/privately-owned-roads-would-end-congestion/). Advocates also reflect back to the early days of America's expansion, and how many of the roads were [private, thus helping fuel development and investment.](https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-1993/private-toll-roads-in-america-the-first-time-around/)

Have there been examples in the past, or in other countries, where all (or a majority) of roads were privately owned? 

In countries that have vast private road system, was there a decrease or increase of cost on consumers of the road?

Would limiting people's access to travel under burden of cost, be a violation of any human rights?"
Is this election an [almost] perfect storm for a perfect a third party candidate? Or at least record-breaking voting for a third party candidate.,"I do not expect a third party, namely libertarian, to actually win, but it has occurred to me with both parties having record unusually high unfavorability of the presumptive nominees, and many unexpected things happening during the election, is it possible given the environment for a third party candidate to swoop in and take a substantial number of votes, based on general election results from the past of similar election year conditions (if those exist?)

Some quick sources for perceived unfavorability:

The Libertarian Party seems to be the ""strongest"" in terms of ability to do this, with even in the past, arguably less ""crazy"" election, their nominee, Gary Johnson, [clinched 1% (1 million) of the popular vote](http://reason.com/blog/2012/11/07/gary-johnson-pulls-one-million-votes-one). This is of course insignificant, and it's wild to think they could get something like 35% of the national vote, but is it possible for them to garner 5-10% from this odd election, given how other elections have played out with third parties in less favorable conditions?

I'm aware that our system is set up to stop third parties as much as possible, but this is also an unique election, at least as of in recent memory."
Policy Successes of Black Lives Matter Organization,"**EDIT:** While I appreciate all of your answers to this question, I see now I was not clear in my distinction between the Black Lives Matter movement, and Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., whose website I linked. In my questions below, and in my title of this post, when I reference the ""Black Lives Matter organization"" (which I admit is a misnomer, though I'll leave the questions unedited for transparency), I mean specifically Black Lives Matter Global Network Inc., and I'm curious about what they've accomplished with respect to policy. I take full responsibility for the confusion, and I apologize.

In the wake of [George Floyd's death](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/30/video-timeline-george-floyd-death/), the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" has been a part of [celebrity social media posts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/06/11/celebrities-black-lives-matter-movement/), [official corporate communications](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/13/after-years-marginalizing-black-employees-customers-corporate-america-says-black-lives-matter/), and [art on the streets of a few US cities](https://dcist.com/story/20/06/12/the-standoff-over-d-c-s-black-lives-matter-mural-illustrated/).

Likewise, donations to groups that focus on combating issues around racial prejudice and race-based inequities have reportedly skyrocketed. Specifically, according to [this article](https://www.nytimes.com./2020/06/14/us/politics/black-lives-matter-racism-donations.html) in the New York Times: 

> ""ActBlue, the leading site to process online donations for Democratic
> causes and campaigns, has experienced its busiest period since its
> founding in 2004, far surpassing even the highest peaks of the 2020
> presidential primary season. (ActBlue confirmed that racial justice
> causes and bail funds had led the way.) The site’s four biggest days
> ever came consecutively this month as it processed more than $250
> million to various progressive causes and candidates in two-plus
> weeks, according to a New York Times analysis of the site’s donation
> ticker.""

That being said, some organizations are more forthcoming about what their funds are responsible for than others. For example, [the NAACP's organizational history page](https://www.naacp.org/nations-premier-civil-rights-organization/) describes their involvement in the processes of the ""integration of the armed forces in 1948 but also passage of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1964, and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.""

The Black Lives Matter website, however, gives far less information than those of comparable organizations. The group's pages within their ""About"" section dedicated to their history as an organization (namely the ""[About Black Lives Matter,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/about/)"" ""[6 Years Strong,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/six-years-strong/)"" and ""[Herstory,](https://blacklivesmatter.com/herstory/)"" pages) all mention the group's formation in 2013-2014, but they don't mention any other significant dates important to the group, or policy successes that the group was responsible for. The only place on the website which does list significant dates and initiatives seems to be the site's [Global Actions page](https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/), which as of posting has not been updated beyond February 2019 (here is a link to the Wayback Machine's [snapshot of this page c. June 13, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200613093333/https://blacklivesmatter.com/global-actions/) for posterity).

This leads me to wonder:

1) Has the Black Lives Matter organization been responsible for changes in policy at the local, state, or federal level in pursuance of their mission?

2 ) If so, what are those changes, and is there any evidence that they have successfully brought the locality, state, or country wherein they were enacted closer to the organization's vision?"

Republicans argue that the [program has enough funding,](http://thehill.com/homenews/house/397805-house-gop-refuse-to-boost-funding-for-election-security) and claim the outrage is political theater:

> States still have money left over from the $380 million in appropriations given to the election assistance grants earlier this year, Sessions said.

Is horizontal merger less scrutinized than a vertical merger?,"The Disney/Fox deal is looming this week. However, [this article](http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/media/21st-century-fox-disney-antitrust/index.html) says it may raise some anti-trust issues along the way. The argument is that Disney will be acquiring 20th Century Fox and 21st’s tv networks to profit, increase their market share, and reduce competition. Both operate in the same industry and offer the same goods and services, which meets the criteria for a horizontal merger, which the article says it's more scrutinized than vertical like AT&T-Time Warner merger. In comparison, it would be harder for Comcast or Verizon to acquire because they're ISPs, whereas Disney is a movie/theme park studio. 

[This](https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-deal-for-fox-would-end-era-of-the-big-six-studios-1512907201) also says that:

Does Trump’s free speech executive order affect conservative Christian universities' long-standing policies of privileging Christian views?,"On Thursday, US President Trump [signed](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/435183-trump-signs-executive-order-aimed-at-protecting-free-speech-on) an [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-improving-free-inquiry-transparency-accountability-colleges-universities/) about free speech on college campuses. The order will [“withhold federal funding from public and private colleges and universities that do not protect free speech on campuses”](https://www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-03-21/trump-to-sign-executive-order-protecting-campus-free-speech).

Many say that this is a move by conservatives to protect against the suppression of conservative views on college campuses—the existence of which is a separate question. However, one might consider how this executive order might actually protect against suppression of non-conservative, non-Christian, or non-heteronormative speech on conservative Christian colleges and universities—e.g., [Liberty University](http://www.liberty.edu/media/1312/hr_formsmanager_forms/Signoff%20for%20Doctrine,%20Ethics,%20&%20Harassment-full%20version%20(01-2015).pdf).

After all, some conservative Christian universities accept federal funds (, e.g., from tuition payments provided by federal [aid](https://www.christiancolleges.com/resources/financial-aid-for-christian-colleges/) or [grants](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111109/grove-city-college-v-bell/).

However, many of these universities regulate not only speech, but also beliefs: They explicitly require faculty and staff to sign faith statements (see “Employment Practices” [here](https://www.cccu.org/institutions/) or an example of a statement [here](http://www.liberty.edu/aboutliberty/index.cfm?PID=6907)). This clearly and systematically requires certain speech and prevents speaking opportunities from atheists, non-Christian religions, and people with certain sexual identities/preferences, etc.—a clear violation of the executive order's attempt to ""promote free and open debate on college and university campuses.""

And many Christian universities do not hide this attempt to regulate speech. They celebrate the fact that they privilege conservative and/or Christian views over others in their curricula/classrooms/events with statements like, [“we integrate a Christian perspective into everything we do”](https://www.biola.edu/student-life). Indeed that might be what conservative Christian students (and/or their parents) find so appealing about the universities: they like the idea of a [“safe environment”](https://www.liberty.edu/residential/students/spiritual-growth/) where young impressionable minds can be protected from atheist/non-Christian/secular speech.

The White House claims that [“private schools \[need only\] follow their own policies, and the executive order will not impact student tuition aid programs”](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-colleges-idUSKCN1R22G0). However, in the past, private Christian universities that seek to maintain their own policies have had to either forgo accepting public funding from students or else seek a religious exemption—e.g., from Title IX standards: see [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/the-controversial-reason-some-religious-colleges-forgo-federal-funding/490253/) and [here](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/591140811/christian-colleges-are-tangled-in-their-own-lgbt-policies). 

So, on the one hand, if the executive order truly ""ensure\[s\] institutions that receive Federal research or education grants promote free inquiry, **including through compliance with all applicable Federal laws, regulations, and policies**"" (such as Title IX), then the executive order creates an opportunity to challenge private Christian colleges' and universities' practice of privileging certain speech and inhibiting other speech (emphasis added; see Section 3 of the executive order).

But, on the other hand, if the order allows private campuses to regulate speech of certain people on the basis of religion or sexuality after all, then the executive order creates an opportunity to challenge private Christian colleges eligibility for certain federal, state, and local funding—e.g., due to Title IX.

Either way, this executive order creates challenges for some private Christian universities in the US. 

# Questions

1. How is this analysis mistaken, if at all?
2. What challenges to Christian universities' speech policies and practices are actually created by this executive order, if any?
3. How does the executive order open itself to challenges of its legitimacy, if at all?
4. How else does this executive order challenge private Christian university policies, practices, or funding, if at all?"
What are some policies that the Afghan government can implement than can affect the country positively in a socio-economic sense?,"To the extent that I know Taliban seem to be [growing in strength](https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-03-23/afghan-taliban-signal-growing-strength-with-capture-of-key-southern-district).

What are the pros and cons of making healthcare policy at the State rather than Federal level?,"Thanks to /u/bokan for the original version of this post.

----

[This paper](http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/jmantel/health-regulatory-process/StateandFederalRolesinHealthCare.pdf) (PDF) discusses the State and Federal roles in providing healthcare. The authors lay out some arguments for each:

* Federal: Some problems are inherently national concerns. Some problems require the fiscal power of the federal government. Some problems require wealth redistribution, which is best carried out by the federal government. Federal government has historically been seen as less prone to corruption and scandal.
* State: Federal government can be inefficient. Some problems are inherently local, including local values. Decentralizing government control promotes civic engagement. State level policies will have a better understanding of local organizations that are effected.


[Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_health_care_reform), [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirigo_Health), and [Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SustiNet_\(Connecticut\)) all have created state-level healthcare. The Massachusetts plan was widely [compared to the ACA](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/11/13/romneycare-vs-obamacare-key-similarities-differences/).


Have those systems been objectively shown to yield better or worse results than the ACA? When it comes to healthcare, what are the pros and cons of 'leaving it up to the states?'

What emergency powers could President Trump use to start construction of a border wall without Congressional approval and to what extent can they be challenged?,"[President Trump said today that this was an option:](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/democrats-trump-meeting-government-shutdown.html)

> At the same time, in response to a question from a reporter, the president held out the possibility that he could declare a national emergency and assume the unilateral power to build a wall without congressional approval.

> “I may do it,” he said, flanked by Mr. Pence, Ms. Nielsen and congressional Republican leaders. “We could call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That’s another way to do it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, that’s better.”

How would this work? From where does the US Executive get this power and are there any checks to prevent the Executive from using emergency powers for non-emergencies?"
Who presides over the senate and what does that entail?,"The United States Constitution provides that office of Vice President of the United States ""shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be evenly divided"" [Article I, Section 3.](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript)  In case of the absence of the Vice President it provides for the office of President Pro Tempore. 

In 1961 Lyndon Johnson, then serving as Vice President, moved his office from the Capitol to the White House and shifted his focus to executive branch functions and left the determination of who commonly presides over the Senate, for all intents and purposes save tie breaking votes, to the Senators, as they are responsible for electing the President Pro Tempore. (https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/President_Pro_Tempore.htm)

What, exactly, does presiding over the Senate entail?

That being said, is there potential for a president elect to be effectively immediately impeached?

Would blatant lying during the campaign be considered ""high crime"" enough?


Who decides when an impeachment is applicable, and investigations began? I know the House of Representatives calls it to action and the Senate does the trial, but does the house require any sort of push?

Is protecting America the same thing as protecting Americans?,"*[I'm going to preface this post by admitting that I have a definite position on this issue, and although I try not to let that get in the way of considering opposing views, I concede in advance that I have a bias.]*

In reading [this article,](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-22809541) where the US Director of National Intelligence justifies recently revealed government intrusions into private communications, I noticed him make a very common conflation of two concepts that sound similar, but I propose to be distinct: **protecting America versus protecting *Americans*.**

The programs the director is defending are presumably counter-terrorism efforts. But in order to accept that thwarting terrorism is equivalent to protecting America, you have to believe that terrorist plots represent an existential threat to the nation. That means the potential attacks would be a coordinated effort likely to kill many millions of citizens, cripple our infrastructure, defeat our military and compromise our government institutions all at once. [The evidence doesn't support that terrorism rises to this level.](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2013/04/statistics-you-are-not-going-to-be-killed-by-terrorists.html)

The Soviet Union, with its bellicose threats and thousands of nuclear-tipped ICBMs aimed at the US, represented an existential threat to the nation. Imperial Japan, having invaded dozens of lands in a steady, five-year march across the Pacific, culminating in a full-scale aerial assault on a US naval base, represented an existential threat to the nation. Nazi Germany, having conquered half of Europe in just two years, and with its submarines attacking US shipping within sight of the East coast, represented an existential threat to the US.

Instead, what I think the Director is saying — probably without recognizing a distinction — is that these terrorists are a threat to American *lives.* But that's not the same thing. The loss of American lives, tragic as it is, does not in itself represent a threat to the nation.

In fact, it could be argued that the best way to protect America — traditionally the land of freedom, liberty, and justice under the law — would be to eliminate all these domestic surveillance programs, targeted killings, indefinite detention and the other associated anti-terrorism measures, because they themselves are a bigger threat to the American way of life than anything a terrorist can muster. But if we accept that terrorism does represent *some* level of threat (albeit not existential), supporting a reduction in counter-terrorism efforts means we would accept higher risk to our personal safety in exchange.

So, the question then becomes, are you willing to slightly increase the risk to your life in order to protect what it means to be American, or do you believe that it's the responsibility of the military to protect American lives, potentially at the cost of the American *way* of life?

-----

I'd like to make two observational side notes here: 

1. Reddit's readership skews decidedly young. If you were born after roughly 1988, America has been on a war footing since you were a teenager. You probably have no personal memory of what American society felt like prior to the September 11, 2001 attacks. There was no TSA, no Patriot Act, no warrantless wiretaps, no Department of Homeland Security, no prison at Guantanamo Bay, no drones, no ""Homeland"" or ""24,"" and most importantly, terrorism was generally seen as something that happened far away. For you folks, defending ""the American way of life"" may seem like a foreign concept, because for your entire adult life, this is the way America has been. I'm making some broad assumptions here, and I'm sure not everyone falls into this category, but as an older redditor, I want to point out that a large portion of the population remembers what it felt like to live in a country where the recently revealed government intrusions would have been considered a shocking overreach, rather than part and parcel of an extensive security mindset.
2. The traditional job of the US military has been to protect the nation from *existential threats,* while it's the role of law enforcement agencies to protect *American lives.* One of the reasons we don't involve the military in law enforcement tasks is because they have the tendency to view everything, including the citizens, as a threat.

Is the monitoring of your cell phone legal? Does the Fourth Amendment (Search and Seizure) protect your right to privacy? When should your privacy rights be limited?,"[CELL PHONE PRIVACY Case description in **Carpenter v. U.S.**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/16-402)

[SCOTUS ON PHONE PRIVACY CASE](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/362450-overnight-tech-scotus-considers-phone-tracking-apples-new)

""Members of the Supreme Court appeared troubled Wednesday that police can search cellphone location histories without a warrant, but struggled with where the line should be drawn on privacy in the digital age… Carpenter says the FBI violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure by obtaining a history of his cellphone location data without a warrant from his wireless carriers, MetroPCS and Sprint. The government then used that information at trial to convict him…   The standard is higher to obtain a warrant, with law enforcement officers required to show there is probable cause to believe a crime has occurred.""

[The **Liberal-Conservative Alliance** on the Supreme Court Against Digital Surveillance](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/bipartisanship-supreme-court/547124/)

""On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard what could become the most important electronic-privacy case of the 21st century. The justices considered whether the government, without a warrant, can effectively trace our movements in public for months on end by demanding 127 days of the geolocational data—known as cell-site location information—that mobile phones beam out 24 hours a day. During the argument, it was encouraging to see two justices with very different perspectives—Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch—make passionate arguments for why allowing these kinds of mass searches of our digital effects would be as invasive and unreasonable as the hated general warrants that helped spark the American Revolution. It’s possible, therefore, that Carpenter v. United States may continue a welcome recent trend: Liberal and conservative justices on the Court, by broad bipartisan margins, are insisting on translating the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution into the digital age.

Justice Elena Kagan framed the stakes in the case by asking Michael Dreeben, the deputy solicitor general, how this case was different from United States v. Jones, a 2012 case where the government tracked a suspect for a month without a warrant by clamping a Global Positioning System device on the bottom of his car. Five justices, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, said that the police violated the suspect’s property rights by committing a physical trespass for the purpose of collecting information—they walked onto his driveway and physically seized his car… Dreeben responded that the Jones case involved government surveillance in public, while in this case, the government was seizing business records that individuals had voluntarily turned over to their third-party cellphone carriers, who stored them in the digital cloud. A 1979 case called Smith v. Maryland held that individuals have no expectation of privacy in the telephone numbers they voluntarily surrender to third parties, establishing what is now known as the third-party doctrine.""

[Would cell phone evidence be more likely to **prove your innocence** that to prove your guilt?]
(https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnvillasenor/2017/10/22/is-warrantless-access-to-cell-site-info-a-fourth-amendment-violation-a-primer-on-carpenter-v-u-s/#1bca6c48603c)

""Given these ambiguities, with respect to evidence in criminal investigations CSLI is often far more useful as an exculpatory mechanism than as a mechanism to establish guilt. After all, CSLI can help show that a suspect was dozens or hundreds of miles away from a crime scene. But it can’t generally establish that a suspect was actually at a crime scene. Even in the case where the suspect was actually in the building of interest when a crime occurred, CSLI can at best help show that the suspect, as well as perhaps thousands of other people, was within a few miles, or a half a mile, or a few hundred yards (the precision depends on the size of the area served by the base station in question) of the crime scene… CSLI provides only a very approximate estimate of the actual location of the phone. For example, it might be possible to know that the phone is within a mile or two of a particular base station, but that wouldn’t be enough to place the phone in a particular building, on a particular street, or even in a particular neighborhood. On the other hand, if the mobile phone happens to be connected to a base station that serves a much smaller area, that would provide correspondingly more accurate location information."""
[META] r/NeutralPolitics is going into lockdown mode and restructuring,"**This is not an April Fools joke!**

Dear users,

From 5:00 p.m. EST today until the morning of April 4th, /r/NeutralPolitics will be in ""lockdown"" mode for restructuring. This meta post, and the various other meta posts linked within, describes what we're doing and why.

(Again, not an April Fools joke.)

--------

**What the lockdown means:**

* Mods will approve no new submissions from now until Monday morning.
* All posts from the previous seven days will be locked until Monday morning. Mods will use the interim period to clean up discussions in those posts to make sure the comments comply with the rules.
* This series of meta posts will stay open so users and mods can interact.

----------

**Why we're doing what we're doing.**

r/NeutralPolitics has a long history of encouraging a certain type of discussion that's not found in many other places on the internet. If you're not familiar with that history, [reading about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) might help you understand our larger goals.

In the last few months, this subreddit has undergone an unprecedented period of subscriber growth and it has brought about a shift in the tone of discussion. That has prompted increasing complaints from the users, which fall roughly into two camps.

Users who are accustomed to the discussion environment we have built over the last four years (we'll call them 'Group A') have complained repeatedly to the mods about the:

* Decline in comment quality.
* Decline in vigilance of policing comments for citations.
* Increase in ""eloquent opinions parading themselves as facts."" (Thanks to a specific user for this apt description.)
* Comments that should be removed for rule violations are instead upvoted by a large number of readers.
* Diminished participation from users who used to contribute well-sourced insights that counter the common narratives.

Meanwhile, other participants (who we'll call 'Group B') complain the rules and enforcement are *too* strict to allow the kind of freeform discussions they find on other subreddits, websites, facebook, at dinner tables, etc. Some of the comments we've received from these users are:

* ""I think"" statements shouldn't require a source. It's just personal opinion.
* Concepts that are, or should be, common knowledge don't require a citation. Everyone knows what their definitions are.
* Speculation is useful, even if it can't be supported with evidence.
* These rules are stifling discussion.

Past waves of growth have been accompanied by similar adjustment and complaint periods, but in all those cases, the Group A folks have vastly outnumbered those from Group B. This time is different. The split of opinions is roughly even now, which means there's a sizable portion of our users who want a discussion environment with more relaxed rules.

This has put us at a crossroads. We have to decide what kind of subreddit we want to be.

After careful consideration, the mods have concluded that adjusting the sub to accommodate Group B would be throwing in the towel on creating the evidence-based environment outlined in our [mission statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_mission_statement), which we're not quite ready to do yet.

Instead, we've decided to launch an outlet specifically for those users. /r/NeutralTalk is a new subreddit based on the rules of /r/NeutralPolitics, but with a few key restrictions eliminated to allow more freeform and speculative discussions. [The official announcement is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvs8/meta_announcing_neutraltalk_a_companion_sub_to/) We encourage you to check it out.

In the meantime, /r/NeutralPolitics, will undergo a *tightening* of the rules, and especially enforcement, in an effort to bring quality back in line with what our long-time users expect and to entice quality contributors back to the discussions.

The following concepts are all outlined in the rules already, but we'll be focusing on more strict enforcement from here on: 

* Prefacing a comment with ""I think"" does not absolve you of the need to support your assertions with logic and evidence. If you're making a claim, you need to make a case for that claim. There are myriad sites on the internet (including /r/NeutralTalk) where you can state your personal opinion without the need for evidentiary support. This isn't one of them.
* ""Commenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith."" What may seem ""obvious"" or ""common sense"" to you is often not to others. In fact, the most obvious conclusions are often wrong and, as it's said, ""*common sense* is the least common of the senses."" So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to provide a source for your assertion of fact, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. The fact that you think your point is obvious, or common knowledge, or self-evident is irrelevant. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. Don't view them as an assault or a challenge. They're just an invitation to provide knowledge.
* As per [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/49fy8q/meta_rneutralpolitics_passing_60k_subscribers_new/) past announcement, posts that are requests for speculation are no longer be permitted on NeutralPolitics. The answers to speculative questions are inherently handicapped against the rules. Please take your requests for *informed* speculation to /r/NeutralTalk.

To some users, especially the folks firmly in Group B, this period of enforcement is going to seem especially brutal. So be it. Hopefully, you'll find a home in /r/NeutralTalk or elsewhere. For right now, the preservation of four years of work is the mod team's highest priority.

On the other hand, if you want to help us restore the tone of discussion that we set out to foster from the beginning, please review the guidelines, source your assertions, and report content that violates the rules. And if you're really committed, [become a mod!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxwm0/meta_neutralpolitics_needs_new_mods/) We need the help.

--------

**Other important notes and changes.**

* We have a new, stricter policy on banning users. Please [read the details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxs5o/meta_new_ban_policy/)

* Most posters don't read the [submission rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) which makes a lot of extra work for moderators. This problem has only increased as our traffic has increased. Fully 60% of submissions never see the light of day in the subreddit. See [here for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxwow/meta_neutralpolitics_traffic_and_submission/)

* We'd like to encourage proposals for additions to our [Comment Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/commenthalloffame). If you have a comment you think is deserving, please let us know in the comments! Additionally, the Hall of Fame will now be more prominently featured on our sidebar as a series of model comments. We hope that they will serve as examples for what we want to see on NeutralPolitics.

Iraqis have long stated protests occur due to [corruption within their government, unemployment, and a lack of access to utilities (electricity, water)](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-49960677) while state governments have been quick to put the blame on other parties, such as Iran's government blaming [western influencers](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iraq-protests-are-real-war-with-US-Khamenei-IRGC-representative-603990) and Iraq's government blaming ['malicious hands'](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/06/iraq-government-pledges-to-investigate-live-firing-on-protesters) outside of their military.

What are the limits of the right to bear arms?,"As we all know, the Second Amendment provides ""..., the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

What's the goal of H.R. 610 in general and what changes does it propose on a local level?,"Here's the summary: Choices in Education Act of 2017

This bill repeals the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and limits the authority of the Department of Education (ED) such that ED is authorized only to award block grants to qualified states.

The bill establishes an education voucher program, through which each state shall distribute block grant funds among local educational agencies (LEAs) based on the number of eligible children within each LEA's geographical area. From these amounts, each LEA shall: (1) distribute a portion of funds to parents who elect to enroll their child in a private school or to home-school their child, and (2) do so in a manner that ensures that such payments will be used for appropriate educational expenses.

To be eligible to receive a block grant, a state must: (1) comply with education voucher program requirements, and (2) make it lawful for parents of an eligible child to elect to enroll their child in any public or private elementary or secondary school in the state or to home-school their child.

No Hungry Kids Act

The bill repeals a specified rule that established certain nutrition standards for the national school lunch and breakfast programs. (In general, the rule requires schools to increase the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat or fat free milk in school meals; reduce the levels of sodium, saturated fat, and trans fat in school meals; and meet children's nutritional needs within their caloric requirements.)

"How dangerous is anti-biotic resistance, and what should the government's reaction be to it?","[The United Nations recently declared anti-biotic resistance as equivalent in danger to global warming in terms of public threat.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/09/antibiotic-resistance-bacteria-disease-united-nations-health/?linkId=29137110)

What are the pros and cons of Britain leaving the EU?,"On Thursday, the UK will hold a referendum on leaving the EU. The Leave camp argues that the EU economy has weakened considerably compared to the UK and that the EU weakens UK sovereignty. It might make sense for the UK to become more independent. 

http://www.businessinsider.com/eu-referendum-reasons-why-a-brexit-is-a-good-idea-2016-6?r=UK&IR=T

On the other hand, the Remain camp is arguing that the UK can still reap social and economic benefits if it stays in the EU. These include being able to negotiate trade with a more powerful entity behind them, access to higher education across Europe, and warning that exiting the EU puts all those benefits in jeopardy.

[Meta] COVID-19 Fact Checking Resources,"On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 [(aka novel coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) as a [pandemic](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020). As such, the moderation team felt compelled to provide some guidelines to assist all participants in developing their own fact-based understanding of the COVID-19 outbreak.

We acknowledge this post is not typical for /r/NeutralPolitics but the moderation team felt it necessary to push back against the [spread of misinformation](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-RESEARCH/0100B5ES3MG/index.html) in hopes of keeping everyone both well informed and safe. 


***What is COVID-19 and what symptoms does it cause?*** 

COVID-19 is a [viral infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) caused by a member of a family of large viruses known as coronavirus. Originally isolated to Wuhan,China, the illness has now been reported in [118 countries across all major continents](https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/c88e37cfc43b4ed3baf977d77e4a0667). 

Symptoms appear to occur within [2-14 days](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html) after initial exposure, with [one study](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported) suggesting an average incubation period of 5.1 days. It is possible to be infected with the COVID-19 virus but not show any symptoms of illness, a state known as asymptomatic infection. Asymptomatic infection is considered relatively rare and early data suggests that asymptomatic viral shedding [does not appear to be a driver of infection](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Most symptoms are generally mild and begin gradually but include fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. 

Currently the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) or R0 (pronounced R-naught or R-zero) is estimated to be anywhere from [2.0](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) to [3.11](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v2). The R0, which is not a fixed value, is thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. For context, the R0 for the seasonal flu is estimated at [1.28](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-14-480) while the 2009 H1N1 Influenza outbreak R0 was at 1.46 and 1.48.  While most cases are mild, [early reports from China](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032) indicated that 16% of COVID-19 cases were severe and as of March 11th COVID-19 mortality rates are 3.4% globally.

It's worth noting that early data is often [incomplete and can be misleading](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-deaths-from-coronavirus-are-so-high-in-italy/), with [many experts](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mortality/why-covid-19-death-rates-are-not-what-they-seem-idUSKBN20Z281) expressing [caution over](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/early-mortality-rates-covid-19-misleading-experts/story?id=69477312) over early reported data.


***COVID-19 Myths and Fact Checking***

As with any developing story, [myths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters) are common. Many health agencies and organizations [like the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html) or the [American Public Health Association](https://www.apha.org/topics-and-issues/communicable-disease/coronavirus) have published simple COVID-19 fact sheets that may be used to verify claims. 


As a general practice it's always good to consider the source, history, evidence, emotion, and pictures (or [SHEEP)](https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/5-tips-ways-we-can-all-covid19-check-coronavirus-information-online-fake-disinformation-misinformation/) of a source. Tools like Google's [Fact Checker Tool](https://toolbox.google.com/factcheck/explorer) and Poynter's [International Fact Checking Network](https://www.poynter.org/media-news/fact-checking/) may provide additional context. 

***Where can I find the current status of the outbreak?***

The WHO is currently publishing daily [situation reports](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). These reports include global morbidity (the state of having the disease) and mortality (death from the disease) counts.  

***How can I protect myself?***

While we are still learning about how COVID-19 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. Fortunately, there are [many basic protective measures](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) an individual can take to reduce their chance of COVID-19 infection.

* Frequent Hand Washing for at [least 20 seconds](https://ew.com/music/coronavirus-covid-19-hand-wash-songs/)
* Maintain a proper social distance of at least 1 meter or 3 feet between you and others
* Avoid touching your face
* Stay at home if you're not feeling well
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance to avoid unnecessarily overwhelming local health systems
* Follow the directions of your local health authority.

What are the implications of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy principles in Syria and their effect on the American-Russian relationship? How do they differ from Obama's?,"This is the transcript of Hillary Clinton's key comments in the debate about about Russia's actions in Syria, as reported by various news sources http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/us/politics/transcript-second-debate.html

>Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime.

>Russia hasn’t paid any attention to ISIS. They’re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground.

>But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it’s all in, in Syria. And they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it’s not me. I’ve stood up to Russia. I’ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president.

>I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that’s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.


>RADDATZ: I’m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy?

>I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy.

>I do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just…


There are various accusations against the Russians, such as not targeting ISIS, targeting civilians and a call for a no fly zone in Syria. 

The no fly zone is a particularly thorny issue since Hillary claims that there won't be ground troops. Additionally, previous precedent has USA seeking international approval in declaring a no fly zone through the UN security council. The UN has the authority to declare a no fly zone, as it did in Libya, and yet as Russia is a member of the security council with a veto, and the Russians are already in Syria, I am not sure how a no fly zone can be followed.

This article that talks from the perspective of what Russians are worried about and gives more the Russian perspective.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/the-kremlin-really-believes-that-hillary-clinton-will-start-a-war-with-russia-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/

It sees that no fly zone is euphemism for shooting Russian planes. Another way to see the no fly zone, as Hillary Clinton argues is that by following a more assertive pollicy, the USA will have more leverage, and force Russia in negotiations.

Julianne Smith who works for Hillary Clinton's working group for Russia and Europe argued that a no fly zone wouldn't necessarily be implemented by shooting at Russian planes but by forcibly grounding Syrian planes. http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/22/hillary-clintons-new-colder-cold-war-russia-putin-election/

In the last debate Hillary Clinton was asked about what would she do differently than Obama in Syria:
 
>RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing?

CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I — if I’m fortunate...

>CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn’t.

>There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation.

>I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders — and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones — made a difference. So I think that could help.

>I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.

Another source on information for the differences in Obama's and Hillary's approaches is this very long article about Obama's foreign pollicy in the Antlantic. The article, called Obama's doctrine is an invaluable source for getting some insight into Obama's perspective. http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/

Quoting from it,

>Hillary Clinton, when she was Obama’s secretary of state, argued for an early and assertive response to Assad’s violence. In 2014, after she left office, Clinton told me that “the failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad … left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.” When The Atlantic published this statement, and also published Clinton’s assessment that “great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” Obama became “rip-shit angry,” according to one of his senior advisers

Some have cited recent initiatives such as [county-wide voting to blame](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/houston/article/Sunrise-voters-set-the-pace-for-Super-Tuesday-in-15101191.php) for the lack of locations while allowing some locations to become packed while others have shorter lines.

Fact check Obama vs. NRA on gun control? (specific quotes included),"I came across the following statement from the NRA in [this article](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/15/482156355/donald-trump-teases-that-he-could-buck-the-nra-on-one-aspect-of-guns):

>""The NRA believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period. **Anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing**. If an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement, the government should be allowed to immediately go to court, block the sale, and arrest the terrorist. At the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed. That has been the position of Sen. John Cornyn (R.-Tex.) and a majority of the U.S. Senate. Sadly, President Obama and his allies would prefer to play politics with this issue.""

There was also [a video](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/obama-to-gun-owners-im-not-looking-to-disarm-you/) making rounds a few days back (before the Orlando shooting) in which Obama said:

>I just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I got people who we know have been on ISIL Web sites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we’re allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but **because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun**. This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much — as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing’s prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is.

Emphasis added in each quote. The statements appear contradictory. My best guess is that both sides are interested in passing legislation to prevent these situations, but both sides also want to package such bills with other more controversial legislation. Can someone give me the full story here? "

What are the pros and cons of implimenting rent controls at the state level?,"Recently, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced plans to support a bill in the state legislature to cap how much landlords can raise rent prices with the goal of limiting price increases, increasing housing availability, and lowering housing prices. The bill, AB 1482, would limit yearly rent increases to 5% (plus the rate of inflation) for the next decade and grant minor eviction protections to renters. Newsom and his allies in the state legislature argue that the bill will help end price gouging and improve the current state of the California rental market. Conversely, the Californian Assn. of Realtors argues that the rent cap will disinsentivize the construction and production of new rental housing units and exsaserbate the already scarce and pricey rental market.

What are the arguments both for and against state wide rent controls? Have such controls ever been implemented in other states, if so what were the outcomes of the controls in said states?

Final reminder:

**Automod will remove all top level comments not by mods.**"
Is Donald Trump's contribution to Pam Bondi bribery?,"The Associated Press has [a story out](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/e16a8223c24048d290883370dc6abe5b/florida-ag-asked-trump-donation-nixing-fraud-case) alleging that Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi solicited a donation to her campaign from Donald Trump while around the same time announcing she may join a New York probe into Trump University, and then closed the investigation shortly after receiving a large campaign contribution from Trump.

>Florida's attorney general personally solicited a political contribution from Donald Trump around the same time her office deliberated joining an investigation of alleged fraud at Trump University and its affiliates

>The new disclosure from Attorney General Pam Bondi's spokesman to The Associated Press on Monday provides additional details around the unusual circumstances of Trump's $25,000 donation to Bondi.

>The money came from a Trump family foundation in apparent violation of rules surrounding political activities by charities. A political group backing Bondi's re-election, called And Justice for All, reported receiving the check Sept. 17, 2013 — four days after Bondi's office publicly announced she was considering joining a New York state probe of Trump University's activities, according to a 2013 report in the Orlando Sentinel.

>After the check came in, Bondi's office nixed suing Trump, citing insufficient grounds to proceed.

Florida law [defines bribery](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0838/0838.html) as follows:

>(1) “Bribery” means corruptly to give, offer, or promise to any public servant, or, if a public servant, corruptly to request, solicit, accept, or agree to accept for himself or herself or another, any pecuniary or other benefit not authorized by law with an intent or purpose to influence the performance of any act or omission which the person believes to be, or the public servant represents as being, within the official discretion of a public servant, in violation of a public duty, or in performance of a public duty.

>(2) Prosecution under this section shall not require any allegation or proof that the public servant ultimately sought to be unlawfully influenced was qualified to act in the desired way, that the public servant had assumed office, that the matter was properly pending before him or her or might by law properly be brought before him or her, that the public servant possessed jurisdiction over the matter, or that his or her official action was necessary to achieve the person’s purpose.

Can a campaign contribution qualify under the above definition as a bribe?  If so, does the AP's reporting indicate that the contribution in question may constitute a bribe?"
Should developed nations like the US replace all poverty abatement programs with the guaranteed minimum income?,"[Switzerland is gearing up to vote on the guaranteed minimum income,](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/magazine/switzerlands-proposal-to-pay-people-for-being-alive.html?pagewanted=2&_r=3&alg=3L4WL&pagewanted=all&) a bold proposal to pay each citizen a small income each month to keep them out of poverty, with very minimal requirements and no means testing.

In the US, similar proposals have been floated as an idea to replace the huge Federal bureaucracies supporting food, housing and medical assistance to the poor. The idea is that you replace all those programs in one fell swoop by just sending money to every adult in the country each month, which [some economists believe would be more efficient \(PDF\).](http://www.usbig.net/pdf/efficiencyargumentforbig.pdf)

It sounds somewhat crazy, but [a five-year experiment in the Canadian province of Manitoba showed promising results \(PDF\).](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~erw/197/forget-cea%20%282%29.pdf) Specifically, the disincentive to work was smaller than expected, while graduation rates went up and hospital visits went down.

Forgetting for a moment about any barriers to implementation, could it work here, there, anywhere? Is there evidence to support the soundness or folly of the idea?"
"Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, are there any circumstances under which the Queen could dismiss the UK Prime Minister?","Boris Johnson, the newly appointed UK Prime Minister, is currently supported based on party breakdown [by a majority of exactly 1 MP](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/02/what-would-it-take-for-boris-johnson-to-lose-his-majority-of-one-tories-labour) in the House of Commons.  Given this precarious position, and the impending [Brexit deadline of October 31](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-47889404) there has been considerable discussion of the possibility that Johnson will face (and possibly lose) a no confidence vote from the House of Commons when Parliament returns in September.  Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn [has said he will bring such a motion.](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-fight-block-no-18836509)

Senior aide to Johnson Dominic Cummings [has been reported as saying](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-to-defy-any-vote-of-no-confidence-s28ksnhzm) that in the event of a no confidence vote, Johnson would refuse to resign.  

Under the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act of 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/14/section/2/enacted) when there is a vote ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty’s Government"" there are 14 days for the House to vote affirmative confidence in a new government, or else an early election happens.

The [Cabinet Manual](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/60641/cabinet-manual.pdf) (at p. 15, part 2.19) describes the process as follows:

>Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act
2011, if a government is defeated on a
motion that ‘this House has no confidence
in Her Majesty’s Government’, there is
then a 14-day period during which an
alternative government can be formed
from the House of Commons as presently
constituted, or the incumbent government
can seek to regain the confidence of the
House. If no government can secure the
confidence of the House of Commons
during that period, through the approval of
a motion that ‘this House has confidence
in Her Majesty’s Government’, a general
election will take place. Other decisions
of the House of Commons which have
previously been regarded as expressing ‘no
confidence’ in the government no longer
enable or require the Prime Minister to hold
a general election. **The Prime Minister is
expected to resign where it is clear that he
or she does not have the confidence of the
House of Commons and that an alternative
government does have the confidence.** 

If the Prime Minister does not resign as the Cabinet Manual expects, or there is a dispute as to whether an alternative government does have the confidence of the Commons, does the Queen retain the reserve power of dismissal?

The only modern example of the dismissal power being used I can find is the [1975 Australian constitutional crisis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis)  Are there any other examples in UK history especially that could be illuminating?"
"Does Building ""The Wall"" Require a Supermajority in Congress?","The question is whether building the remainder of [Mexico-US Border Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_barrier) requires a supermajority of votes in Congress?

As an initial matter, a [supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States) is the requirement that more than a simple over 50% majority of Congress vote in favor of legislation for it to pass.  Depending on what's attempting to be enacted this number can vary from [60% to 80%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#United_States).

Generally, [spending bills require a supermajority](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congress-set-to-delay-shutdown-setting-up-bigger-spending-fight-later/2017/12/07/6b6712fa-db51-11e7-b1a8-62589434a581_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7895a94a9e16):

>In the Senate, a 60-vote supermajority is required to pass most major legislation

However, its not that simple.  Apparently there is something referred to as budget reconciliation which [allows the Senate to bypass the supermajority requirement](https://qz.com/1110552/federal-budget-resolution-what-it-means-for-the-republican-tax-plan/) in some situations:

>Reconciliation is a procedural mechanism originally intended to quickly clean up minor differences in the spending plans proposed by the Senate and the House by setting aside rules [such as the supermajority requirement] that slow the process. 

Beyond reconciliation there is the possibility of building the wall through executive order. 
 An order to build the wall was made on [January 25, 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13767) by President Trump.  However, the funding for the order still apparently [must still come through Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13767#Funding).

Since the signing of that order, Congress has yet to pass adequate funding such that now there is discussion of [whether the executive branch can use existing funds for the border wall](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/12/24/donald-trump-shutdown-congress-approval-build-border-wall-spending-column/2402442002/):

>[T]he White House put out a call to federal agencies to look for “pots of money” in their existing budgets that could be cobbled together to pay for border wall construction. 

This opens a whole host of other questions:

1.  Are there existing funds that are appropriated to something that can legally be argued to be used on a border wall?  I suspect part of the executive branch calling the need for the border wall a national emergency might have something to do with opening the door for existing funds that are earmarked for ""emergencies"" to be made available for the wall;

2.  Is there some type of slush fund the executive branch can use to build the wall?

3.  Harkening back to the initial question, can Congress pass funding without a supermajority?"
What would need to be cut to achieve the rumored $10.5 trillion in cuts proposed by the Trump administration?,"[The Hill is reporting today](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts) that the Trump administration's first proposed budget will include $10.5 trillion in cuts over a 10 year period.

The article lists a few programs which are on the chopping block:

* $900 million from economic development programs

* $286 million from [community policing programs.](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/821491/download)

* A maximum of $489 million from [violence against women act programs.](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822296/download)

* [$385 million from legal aid programs](http://www.lsc.gov/media-center/publications/fy-2017-budget-request)

* [$147 million from the National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/nea-fy16-appropriations-request.pdf)

* [$445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.](http://www.cpb.org/files/appropriation/justification-FY17-and-FY19.pdf)

* [$3.28 billion](https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/01/f19/DOE%20FY%202016%20Budget%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf) from renewables programs at the Department of Energy.

* $33 million by reducing nuclear energy research to 2008 levels. [$875 million in 2008](https://energy.gov/articles/department-energy-requests-243-billion-fy-2008-budget) vs [$908 million in the most recent budget I could find](https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/01/f19/DOE%20FY%202016%20Budget%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf)





There are a couple of other cuts whose amounts I can't calculate, but they don't seem to be to large programs.

Adding up the above, it gets to about $5.5 billion in cuts.

To achieve $10500 billion in cuts over 10 years would arithmetically require about $1050 billion in cuts in the first year.  Maybe a bit less if we account for inflation.

The specified cuts are ~0.5% of the total necessary to achieve the stated target.  What would plausibly be the other 99.5% of the cuts?  Have specific proposals been made in the past which identify particular programs?  The article mentions a 2015 Republican Study Committee budget, but I can't find if that proposed specific cuts to specific programs, or if it was just a general level target."
I'm not strictly aligned with either U.S. political party. Why can't the Republicans put forth a candidate in recent years that appeals to voters like me?,"It seems there is something about the nature of Republican primaries and the party stances themselves that lend the Republican party in recent years to not put forth candidates which appeal to neutral voters like me.

To keep perspective, we just had a two-term Republican president leave office eight years ago—so it's not like Republican wins are rare unicorns in the 21st century. But the GOP's results in the three presidential elections since then are not good. In 2008, the election was marred from a centrist's perspective by [Sarah Palin's nomination for VP](http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/2008/11/five-reasons-th.html/), combined with [stronger unity within the Democratic party](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/us/politics/08dems.html?_r=0). In 2012, Romney and Ryan ran a [bizzarely poor campaign](https://shadowproof.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-ten-biggest-mistakes/). In 2016, we have only seen the Primaries drama and Trump so far, so centrist voters are naturally alienated—but there is no guarantee the Republican nominee will swing far enough back to the center to entice moderate voters this election.

Politically, I am divided almost 50-50 between Democratic platform and Republican platform. I vote more based on foreign policy than domestic policy matters. I would be happy to consider a viable Republican challenger to Hillary Clinton, if one appears. But the Republican Party still has been unable to produce an appealing candidate in recent years.

**Is there a concrete reason why this is? Perhaps it's just a case of bad luck in wooing swing votes? Or maybe the answer is simple, and I'm just not a representative centrist voter?** Thank you for your thoughts."
How does the UK Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011) impact a finding of contempt against a government minister?,"**Background**

There is presently [a controversy over alterations of reports given to the House of Commons related to Brexit by Brexit minister David Davis.](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/27/mps-attack-david-davis-for-handing-over-redacted-brexit-reports)  That controversy has included suggestions, including contempt of Parliament.  Such allegations [would be made to the Speaker, Mr. Bercow, who would then possibly refer it to a committee for adjudication if he found evidence of contempt.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42149793)

Under other Westminster systems, a finding of contempt has been the basis of a no-confidence measure against the government.  Notable recently was the 2011 [fall of the Harper government in Canada on issues of contempt similar to those alleged in the UK.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-government-falls-in-historic-commons-showdown/article4181393/)

Davis is not Prime Minister, but under principles of [collective responsibility of the Government to the Commons](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7755) his position could be attributed to the government as a whole.  It has been argued by Ian Brodie in the Canadian context that [individual impeachment has become depricated by collective responsibility and that if a single minister were found to have lost confidence, it would fell the entire government.](https://parliamentum.org/2017/01/04/on-collective-ministerial-responsibility-and-impeachment/)

However, in 2011 the UK changed electoral laws with the [Fixed Term Parliaments Act (2011).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011)  This law requires that early dissolution requires either a two-thirds vote for a measure that there should be an early election, or else a simple majority must adopt a resolution ""That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government.""

**Question**

How would a finding of contempt of Parliament against a government minister fit into that framework, if not accompanied by the requisite finding of no confidence in Her Majesty's Government to trigger the FTPA?"
Should laws regarding LLCs be changed for the purpose of reducing illegitimate activities?,"With the [recent news of Trump profiting significantly this past year from anonymous LLCs](http://www.newsweek.com/trump-real-estate-secret-buyers-777276), there is increased focus on the potential for illegitimate usage of LLCs. [LLCs have both legitimate and illegitimate uses] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/06/13/7-reasons-property-buyers-use-llcs-legit-not/102387054/). 


There has been some [recent legislation](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl0451.aspx) to address the abuse of the LLC system. Are there other proposals out there that could reduce the amount of corruption and money-laundering associated with LLCs? Have other countries had success with this issue, or is this a uniquely American issue?"
Does white privilege exist in the United States?,"What evidence is there that [white privilege](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/org/wsar/intro.htm) does or does not exist? When you look at [statistics](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p13.pdf) on their surface, it seems as though there is a racial bias, if nowhere else, in our court systems. An argument that I have heard is that it's an issue of [poverty](http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/) and not race, as black people are impoverished in higher proportions than white people. However, this seems to further the idea of white privilege since there is no reason that a black person would be inherently prone to poverty. Even with all of this considered, wouldn't there have to be some type of policy or law that would lend itself to these facts?

I must admit I think I am quite ignorant on this topic. So I don't know if the idea of ""white privilege"" is legitimate or not, or what the further facts on this subject are. I hear it mentioned quite frequently so I would like some unbiased and fact based opinions on this. I'm sure I am missing something."

"How feasible is it for Bernie Sanders to implement the substantially left leaning changes he promised as part of his election campaign, if elected president?","
I use ""substantially left leaning changes"" to mean left leaning relative to Hillary Clinton. Compare [Sanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Political_positions) and [Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Hillary_Clinton#As_described_by_others). (The assumption being that the more center leaning a President is, the easier it is to mostly agree to him/her for Congress, and by extension his/her proposed bills.)

I am looking at these promises he made in terms of feasibility of implementation:

*     He will break up big financial institutions. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/). He has also promised to remove private bank(er)s from the board of the federal reserve. [Read more](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/23/bernie-sanders-wall-street-federal-reserve-bankers).
*    Break up lobbying by regulating how campaigns receive funding, promoting small donations. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/money-in-politics/).
*    He has said he would tax the top 0.3% richest US citizens to give benefits to the rest, such as making public colleges tuition free. [Read more here](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/) and [here](https://berniesanders.com/issues/its-time-to-make-college-tuition-free-and-debt-free/).
*    He has said he would try to achieve peace in the middle east by diplomacy, and engage in military action only with support from allies and in limited scope. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/war-and-peace/).


To what extent will factors like scope of presidential authority, Congress, big financial institutions, allied countries etc. influence the feasibility of implementing these policies?

As an example while Barack Obama is the current President: 

* He  wanted to shutdown Guantanamo Bay and Congress said [nope](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30826649/ns/politics-capitol_hill/). 
* He campaigned for raise of minimum wage, but only a few states [agreed](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamas-2014-report-card). 
* Big Financial Institutions through lobbying Congress were able to [pressurize](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/wall-street-continues-to-spend-big-on-lobbying/) regulators against many reforms for financial responsibility post the 2008 bailout.
* [Obama Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) was met with resistance from multiple court cases, Congress, individual state implementations.


P.S- I am a first time submitter here, and new to US politics, so I welcome a chance to improve my understanding.

This Yale review holds the position that courts should consider that [Voting is speech](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1702&context=ylpr), and should be fully protected under the 1st amendment.

>[Congress shall make no law \[...\] abridging the freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text)

First Past the Post AKA Plurality AKA Single-Choice Voting: http://www.prsa.org.au/pluralit.htm

>A plurality electoral system is one where ballots are normally not valid unless they have been marked by the voter to indicate the candidate or candidates that the voter wishes to have elected, but no more candidates can be indicated in this way than the number of vacancies to be filled, without invalidating the ballot, so the information that voters are allowed to provide about their ranking of the candidates in their order of preference for them is deliberately and unnecessarily limited. Each candidate marked gets equal value from the vote, as voters cannot indicate their preferred priority among the candidates. Each mark is thus a first preference vote, but there is no provision for any later preferences of voters for candidates with more votes than they need - or of the candidates with the fewest votes - to be indicated, for transfer to remaining continuing candidates.

Is an electoral system that restricts the expressiveness of a vote (i.e. FPTP) in breach of the 1st amendment?

RCV has been challenged for being unconstitutional. Could FPTP be counter-challenged for being unconstitutional?"

Legal & Ethical Implications of Subpoenaing the Interpreter for the Trump/Putin Summit,"
Thanks to /u/tmster2 for the original version of this submission.

***

Following President Trump's [private meeting](https://apnews.com/afd7db4f7c024a678c696da68edd15ce) with Putin in Helsinki, [Senate Democrats expressed concerns](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/19/helsinki-summit-democrats-want-hear-trumps-interpreter/799733002/) about the meeting and requested the interpreter testify before them in a closed session so they could ascertain what, if anything, was agreed to.  

Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee also attempted to subpoena the interpreter, but were [blocked by the Republicans on the Committee.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-block-democrat-attempt-subpoena-trump-interpreter/story?id=56687970) 

Based on this, a few questions arise:

1. Is is legal to force an interpreter for the President to testify via subpoena?

2. Are there ethical complications in doing so?

3. Is there precedent for calling an interpreter to testify?

"In the US, who receives more public services and benefits: veterans or illegal immigrants?","At a Memorial Day biker rally in Washington DC last weekend Donald Trump said,

>""...in many cases, illegal immigrants [are taken much better care of] than veterans in this country."" [Source, quote in 2nd video](http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36410559)

Which got me thinking, who receives more public benefits, veterans or illegal immigrants?

&nbsp;

In 1996, ""welfare reform legislation specifically limited the eligibility of immigrant households to receive assistance."" [Source](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272702001883)

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, I am having trouble finding what federal programs are still available to undocumented immigrants, and many public assistance programs vary on a state-by-state basis. 

&nbsp;

Some benefits available to Veterans can be found on the US Department of Veterans Affairs website [here](http://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/). These benefits are exclusive to veterans of the US armed forces and their families.

&nbsp;

Some factors to consider, but are not limited to: 


* Housing
* Food assistance
* Long term healthcare
* Emergency healthcare
* Mental healthcare services

Is there risk involved when attempting to receive public benefits as an undocumented or illegal immigrant?

"The Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn NY faced widespread outcry after they suffered a long-term power outage that left prisoners with no light or heat. Who currently has oversight over Federal Detention Centers, and how would a 'Federal Monitor' change how oversight is conducted?","In late January of this year there was a [long-term power and heat outage](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/nyregion/brooklyn-jail-no-heat-inmates.html) at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn NY.

The outage took place during cold spike in NY and was widely disruptive to inmates, leaving them with no light, hot water, or heat.

It drew [crowds of protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/nyregion/brooklyn-federal-jail-heat.html) and the attention of [some lawmakers and elected officials](https://www.apnews.com/fdc41f64df494c0c94cd918e1da1757f):

> U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez says she visited the jail with other elected officials Saturday and the heat was uneven and sporadic. She said the inmates had no light in their cells and they “are very angry and complaining.”

The Metropolitan Detention Center has previously been embroiled in issues of mistreatment of prisoners (From the first link):

> After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the inspector general found that officers slammed Muslim inmates face-first against walls and told them they would die in secret. The inspector general also participated in an investigation into the beatings of two inmates by officers in 2002 and 2006.

> More recently, an investigation focused on officers who sexually assaulted female inmates who were on overnight cleaning duty between 2013 and 2016. Two former M.D.C. lieutenants and a correction officer were convicted, including one lieutenant who repeatedly raped a prisoner and threatened to send her to solitary confinement if she reported it.

> Last year, another inspector general report condemned conditions for women housed in an adjacent building. The women were confined to one floor with almost no natural light or time outside.  

This has sparked a request for an 'outside monitor' (From the 1st link):

> Lawyers with the federal defenders, which represents hundreds of inmates at the jail, filed a lawsuit on Monday asking a Brooklyn federal judge to appoint an outside monitor who would have unfettered access to the jail.

> “The I.G. previously has investigated M.D.C. and issued harshly critical reports,” said Ms. von Dornum, the federal defender. “But nothing has changed.”

An 'outside' or ['independent monitor'](https://nypost.com/2019/02/04/judge-orders-lawyers-be-allowed-to-visit-metropolitan-detention-center-inmates/), is probably making reference to a *court appointed monitor* that [has been used](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/new-jersey/articles/2019-01-18/federal-monitor-gives-newark-police-mixed-grades-in-report) in institutional [corruption cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/nyregion/nycha-federal-monitor-repairs.html) before.

What are the pros and cons of basing eligibility for social security on life expectancy?,"Current SS benefits eligibility starts at 62, with greater amounts if you don't take until later. In it's current form, many individuals may be getting the short end of the stick in social security by never reaping benefits or reaping it for much fewer years than average. Conversely, some people may get benefits for 40+ years. These discrepancies can be seen not just individually but also in demographics when broken down by race and gender:

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_03.pdf - White and hispanic women live about a decade longer than black men

http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/412943-Has-Social-Security-Redistributed-to-Whites-from-People-of-Color-.PDF - Money is being distributed from PoC to whites

https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v62n2/v62n2p59.pdf - ""Minorities and Social Security: An Analysis of Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Current Program""

These individual and demographic discrepancies could be mitigated by attributing life expectancy (as in years left to live, not as in expected age of death) as triggers for social security benefits, or taken into consideration along with age for social security eligibility. Here is a table of life expectancy for Americans based on age and sex, for an example of what I mean (much more than age and sex could be taken into consideration): https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html

Disregarding how life expectancy would be calculated, what are the pros and cons of basing eligibility for social security on life expectancy rather than age?

The [arguments](http://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/other-voices/article187144198.html) for these subsidies are that they are needed because abundant and cheap natural gas, combined with the expansion of renewable/green energy sector, make the energy market [uncompetitive](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-powergrid-perry/u-s-energy-head-seeks-help-for-coal-nuclear-power-plants-idUSKCN1C42G0) for coal and nuclear.

A few years later, following Kennedy's assassination, LBJ brokered the [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964) through congress, and followed up in 1965 with [Executive Order 11246](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11246), later amended with [Executive Order 11375](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11375), to include sex-based discrimination in the laws, and ""to correct the effects of past and present discrimination."" Since, there have been [many cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States#Legal_history) of expanded regulation and court rulings to expand on how these laws and Executive Orders effect our country.

However, if we look at the racial breakdown of our workforce, and compare it to the Census data, the representation appears to be very close to equal, despite the higher unemployment rates of certain minorities.

Can we say beyond a reasonable doubt that affirmative action has either worked or failed? Is race-based affirmative action an effective course of legislation for the United States, instead of something like class-based affirmative action? Or is there some alternative method that I haven't mentioned here?"

What is the evidence for and against China being a competitor and/or threat to U.S. power?,"I know very little of global politics and can only understand from the bits and pieces that I read from history about how China came into being as a superpower.

For multiple times, I was exposed to this idea that China [is slowly growing in power since the Cold War and is being seen as the replacement of the USSR](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330543467_Study_on_the_rise_of_China_as_a_dangerous_superpower) and as a threat against the U.S. - the superpower that wants [to compete against the U.S.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/us-china-allies-competition/606637/) or the Western world in general, whether it is

&#x200B;

Is there any substantial evidence to support the claim that China can be seen as a threat by the U.S. or even the Western world in general, or can be seen as a threat in the near future?

Or are there any evidence that does not support this claim despite the ongoing growth in China as a superpower?"

What are the pros and cons of ethanol subsidies and mandates?,"[Ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol) is a plant-derived alcohol that's used, among other things, as a biofuel.

In the United States, the government [subsidizes the production of ethanol and mandates its mixture with gasoline to varying degrees.](https://www.thoughtco.com/understanding-the-ethanol-subsidy-3321701)

Using ethanol in this way has its [pros and cons,](https://www.thebalance.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-ethanol-809300) both environmentally and economically.

I'm interested in knowing how those pros and cons play into the policy decision to subsidize ethanol production and mandate its use."
How does the Republican Party's enthusiasm for tax cuts compare to other right of center political parties among G20 countries?,"In the US the Republican Party is [famous for cutting taxes](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/us-parties-republican-democrat-taxes.asp), most recently with the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.](https://taxfoundation.org/the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-simplified-the-tax-filing-process-for-millions-of-americans/)

However prioritizing tax cuts appears to be a relatively recent development.

[George H.W. Bush raised taxes in 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_Budget_Reconciliation_Act_of_1990) and famous tax-cutter Reagan [raised taxes a few times in the 80's:](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2017-12-15/the-mostly-forgotten-tax-increases-of-1982-1993)

This led me to wonder: Do other right of center political parties among other G20 countries prioritize tax cuts in the same manner as the American Republican Party?

For example, should I expect the tax policies of right of center parties in Germany and India to be similar to that of the Republican Party in the US?"

What are legislative alternatives to the current practice of Gerrymandering in the US? What pros (if any) argue that no policy change is needed?,"**ger·ry·man·der**
verb *ˈjerēˌmandər* ***manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class.***


Here is an old CGP Grey video on it for those who aren't familiar.  This video helps get an intuitive grasp of simple forms of gerrymandering:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY


Gerrymandering is a common action in the US today and results in entrenched districts being created.  Groups like FairVote, and others have cited this is a cause for concern.

http://www.fairvote.org/gerrymandering#gerrymandering_key_facts

Some sources claim that gerrymandering does not reduce the effectiveness of local representation (in terms of obtaining local funding), although it can skew party representation:

https://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/research/gerrymandering.pdf

A summary of alternatives (as well as a discussion of the broad unpopularity of the current system) is discussed here:  https://news.virginia.edu/content/citizens-don-t-gerrymandering-study-offers-alternative-redistricting-methods

Should this be a legislative focus to fix, and if so, how should it be done?  Are the efforts in California and Iowa (described in the previous link) a good approach?

This may not be politically tenable, given that many reports claim that Republican majorities in the House stem directly from gerrymandering efforts over the last decades.

Can federal and state courts in the United States use legal arguments and tests from foreign courts in similar legal systems to inform the development of nascent legal doctrines?,"The Commonwealth countries (e.g Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom) developed public interest legal standing doctrines particularly suited for questions regarding environmental degradation and ecological destruction.^[1](http://www.columbiaenvironmentallaw.org/public-interest-standing-and-judicial-review-of-environmental-matters-a-comparative-approach/)  The United States so far lacks liberalized standing doctrine for environmental claims; Jeffery T.

when the claim raised a constitutional question, but it was
subsequently settled in Finlay that public interest standing is also
available in judicial review of administrative agencies.102 In Finlay,
the court combined the Standing Trilogy’s lessons into the
contemporary three-part test: 
**(1) Is there a justiciable and serious
issue to be tried?  (2) Does the applicant have a genuine interest in
the subject matter? and (3) Is there another reasonable and
effective manner for the case to be brought forward?** The third
prong was elaborated upon in a recent Canadian Supreme Court
case:
[T]he third factor in the public interest standing analysis should be
expressed as: whether the proposed suit is, in all of the
circumstances, a reasonable and effective means of bringing the
matter before the court. This factor, like the other two, must be
assessed in a flexible and purposive manner and weighed in light of
the other factors.

(1) - Does the Supreme Court have the authority to develop a public-interest legal standing doctrine?

How can we hope to build consensus when even mathematical facts are trumped by political bias?,"[This fascinating article](http://grist.org/politics/science-confirms-politics-wrecks-your-ability-to-do-math/) about a recent Yale study does not bode well for the potential to build political consensus between disparate groups.

I highly recommend reading the whole thing, but the gist of it is this: given a math problem relating to the efficacy of a skin cream, people got the answers right according to their individual mathematical ability (numeracy), but given *the same data* relating to the efficacy of gun control laws, people were more likely to answer according to their political beliefs. What's more, respondents with higher numeracy were actually *more* likely to be affected by their bias.

So, if facts don't trump bias, even in those people best equipped to analyze the facts, what hope do we have of producing effective policies? And to get meta, what is the point of this subreddit?"

Given that some high-level Trump administration officials are [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/private-email-trump-kushner-bannon.html) to use private email servers for official business, and given that [text messages](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/chairs-on-volker/index.html) have made up much of the documentary evidence in the impeachment investigation, I'm wondering whether Congress can bypass the ongoing fight over the administration's [refusal to comply with subpoenas](https://apnews.com/4bde10e62e204c50a014eef51f06361b) by subpoenaing some information from third-party internet and telecommunications companies that might hold relevant data, such as email, text messages, and Web search history.

A few specific questions:

* What is the precedent for a Congressional investigation to subpoena documents from an internet/telecom company that stores them rather than from the person they belong to?
* Can Congress issue a broad subpoena to a company asking for all data from a government official's personal accounts that might be relevant to their investigation? If so, is the company obligated to sort through all of the official's personal accounts and decide which documents are responsive to the request?
* If a company possesses confidential messages between members of the executive branch, is it obligated to protect executive privilege?
* What specific kinds of data from which specific people are relevant to the impeachment investigation?"

Evaluating the perceptions and realities of public housing,"Public housing has not enjoyed much support as a policy mechanism in recent decades under either Republic or Democratic administrations.

Public housing saw a 600% increase in units built between 1949 and 1979, and an 18.2% increase between 1979 and 1994, which almost [exactly kept pace with population growth](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/POPTOTUSA647NWDB). However, the period between 1994 and 2008 saw the demolition of nearly 270,000 units of public housing stock, a decrease of about 19% despite the U.S. population *increasing* 16% over the same period. [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=housing+policy+in+the+united+states&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3hsmfhenSAhWL8YMKHa0sA4wQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=housing%20policy%20in%20the%20united%20states&f=false)

Alex Schwartz states ""public housing evokes many, mostly negative images in the popular imagination: extreme poverty, grim architecture, neglected grounds, and, not least, crime."" [source](https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=housing+policy+in+the+united+states&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3hsmfhenSAhWL8YMKHa0sA4wQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=housing%20policy%20in%20the%20united%20states&f=false), pg. 163.

Is it true, as Howard Husock writes, that ""most policy experts agree these days that big public housing projects are noxious environments for their tenants"" and [the cities that surround them](https://www.city-journal.org/html/how-public-housing-harms-cities-12410.html)?

Perhaps these broad declarations of public housing failure go too far and it's merely the isolated, high-rise city projects that have failed, the perspective taken by advocates like [John Atlas, Peter Dreier](http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/77/pubhsg.html) and [Oscar Newman](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=39495).

Perhaps, as some others have argued, public housing has secretly been among the most [effective](http://www.businessinsider.com/5-myths-about-public-housing-2015-9) and [durable](https://books.google.com/books?id=3bDcAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=housing+policy+in+the+united+states&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi3hsmfhenSAhWL8YMKHa0sA4wQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=housing%20policy%20in%20the%20united%20states&f=false) programs of poverty alleviation in the country.

So, how effective has public housing been at alleviating poverty and housing burden in the U.S. and other developed nations? Is it a cost efficient program for accomplishing these goals? Does the general impression of public housing reflect the reality? If not, what has caused the disconnect between perception and reality?"

Further still, there's a narrative that the media has a [neoliberal bias](http://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/etd/622/). The case is made that this links to a [substantial media bias against Sanders](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/7/11378858/sanders-media-bias).

Further still, there's a trend towards a [""data journalism"" school, as practiced by the NYT Upshot, Vox, and FiveThirtyEight](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/22/upshot-vox-fivethirtyeight-data-journalism-golden-age), which seeks neutrality through data-backed arguments. Even this has been perjoratively labeled [""line chart liberalism""](https://jasonlefkowitz.net/2014/01/against-line-chart-liberalism/), given the bias inherent in curating the data that's presented to the reader.

* Does this journalistic objectivity matter, and if so, how much? 

* Does it matter more or less when voters are closer in time to being asked a ballot question? 

* Are there certain journalistic methods that are more objective than others? Are journalists suppressing legitimate dialogue by selecting those methods?

* Does overtly agenda-driven media get a pass?

* Are there ways that a government can regulate or deregulate media that could change the ethics of an organization's journalistic objectivity?"

Critics have described Trump's assertions as [""completely insane,""](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/trumps-fbi-russia-scandal-spy-theory-mueller-insane.html) and as Jonathan Chait argues:

>This does not explain why the FBI failed to announce either the results of its spying campaign, or even the existence of the investigation, in time to help Clinton win, rather than allowing the probe to remain secret until well after the election. 

Robert Mueller [was appointed](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/967231/download) by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ""to conduct the investigation confirmed by then-FBI
Director James B. Comey in testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence on March 20, 2017, including: any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals
associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.""

* What do we know about the conduct of Mr. Halper?

* Is there anything unlawful alleged in Mr. Halper's conduct directly, or in the FBI coordinating with him in respect to investigating the conduct of advisers to the Trump campaign, or their contacts with the Russian government?

Will there be a negative impact on doctors and other healthcare providers once Obamacare is repealed?,"If some 20 million people are now uninsured or in uninsured limbo until the GOP finds a new solution, and with healthcare in the US being ridiculously expensive out of pocket, will healthcare providers experience an abrupt halt in patients, especially those who are in specialized fields?

Stop and frisk: is it effective? Should it be legal?,"Stop and frisk, also known as a Terry Stop, was a policing strategy [famously expanded]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-and-frisk_in_New_York_City) by New York City in the mid-2000s by Mayor Bloomberg and [only recently reduced](http://www.nyclu.org/content/stop-and-frisk-data) by Mayor de Blasio. The strategy involves stopping and questioning pedestrians, followed by frisking the individual for contraband. The practice was [officially legalized]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_v._Ohio) in the Supreme Court case Terry v Ohio, as long as reasonable suspicion exists. 

The policy has been linked by some to lower crime rates in the city during the period, and some [have accused its decline]( http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/exclusive-big-fall-stop-and-frisk-criminals-bolder-article-1.2247406) as responsible for rising crime rates. However, some studies have found [little evidence]( http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07418825.2012.712152) that stop and frisk by itself has an effect on crime, though on the other hand, other cities [have seen]( http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/17/does-stop-and-frisk-reduce-crime/stop-and-frisk-has-lowered-crime-in-other-cities) similar declines in crime rates after the policy’s adoption.

The legality of the practice has been questioned as well, especially since “probable cause” can be quite difficult to define. Philadelphia [has seen legal struggles]( http://www.newsweek.com/2016/06/10/stop-and-frisk-philadelphia-crisis-reform-police-460951.html) over the issue, and a number of civil rights groups have advocated against it. 

**Is stop-and-frisk effective?**

"Free or reduced cost of college has been a major theme this election season, which some claim would actually devalue existing degrees. Is there any evidence for this view? And are the other benefits worth it?","A common criticism of expanded access to higher education, whether through government-funded college or other means, is that [a greater number of degrees may devalue existing degrees](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/patricia-mcguire/free-community-college-gi_b_6451562.html), hurting those already with higher education while reducing the benefits for the newly educated. 

There are a number of issues to consider here. First of all, **is there any evidence that expanding the number of graduates actually depresses wages?** While intuition suggests that rising supply would lower prices (i.e. wages), it has been [pointed out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy) that labor is far from being a homogenous good, and so the classic logic of supply and demand applies more weakly to it. Additionally, there is [some evidence](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157400800480018X) that a higher density of the highly educated leads to greater knowledge spillover between firms and industries, boosting productivity (and hopefully wages).

Secondly, **do the peripheral benefits of higher education outweigh the costs of lower wages?** The rhetoric around higher education frequently references the need to focus on high-earning majors such as STEM, leading to policy changes such as the [cutting of social science and humanities funding in Japan](http://time.com/4035819/japan-university-liberal-arts-humanities-social-sciences-cuts/).

"Is there a health insurance ""coverage gap""? If so, why are some people too poor for ACA/""Obamacare"" and too rich for Medicaid?","A common criticism against ACA/""Obamacare"" is that there still remains a significant health care coverage gap where people who have no other coverage and can't afford an ACA plan will be fined on their income taxes.

[healthcare.gov outlines the exemption rules as follows:](https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool/#/results/2016/details/marketplace-affordability)

> Coverage is considered to be unaffordable if the lowest cost Bronze-level plan available to you through the Marketplace in 2016 is more than 8.13% of your household income.

> The total cost to you must be more than 8.13%, accounting for any premium tax credit you would qualify for if you enrolled in that plan.

> If you qualify for this exemption, it may apply to everybody on your tax return.

This sounds completely reasonable and it would surprise me if there really are many people who will unavoidably incur the penalty.

Is there really a coverage gap? If so, how significant is this problem? What estimates have been published for the number of Americans that are uninsured because they do not have an employer that provides health insurance, cannot afford an ACA plan, do not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid, and are not merely refusing or neglecting to purchase a plan? Are there many people who have no other coverage and cannot reasonably afford ACA or do most of these people instead just not *want* to pay for coverage?

If the gap does exist and affects many people, why does it exist? Was it purely an oversight in the ACA itself or is it somehow the unforeseen consequence of a mix of factors?

Here's [an example](http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/21/news/economy/obamacare-medicaid-coverage-gap-texas/) of an article talking about the coverage gap.

Do the superdelegates in the democratic primary actually matter?,"Following the Wisconsin primaries, the current tally of ordinary delegates for Clinton is 1,274, while Sanders has 1,025.

A summary of the results can be seen [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/primary-calendar-and-results.html).

The sum of delegates plus superdelegates suggests that Clintons lead is significantly larger, then, than that of voted and caucused delegates alone. However there is no precedent for superdelegates to go against the aggregate public vote and the democratic party would likely lose considerable public goodwill should they be seen to be 'kingmaking' against the will of democratic public.

Although originally focused on killings of African-Americans by police across the nation, the movement's founder, Alicia Gray, has [since acknowledged](http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/) that the movement has evolved into a more widespread protest against societal and institutional violence that targets black individuals.

The movement has become so culturally pervasive that it has even been featured on a recent episode of *Law & Order: SVU*. 

However, the movement has faced criticism for both its goals and its tactics. The movement has [been accused of](http://nypost.com/2015/11/06/black-lives-matters-numbers-are-bogus/) fabricating death counts and other statistics, while [others worry](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/USA-Update/2015/0913/Can-Black-Lives-Matter-and-Police-Lives-Matter-coexist-video) that the movement promotes anti-white radicalism.

Supporters of the movement counter that such tactics are necessary to draw attention to the issues faced by the African-American community.

The Federal Reserve will soon be raising rates. Is this correct choice? Should it have happened sooner or later? What effects can we expect?,"Yesterday, Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve, [announced](http://fortune.com/2016/12/14/fed-interest-rates-6/) that for only the second time in nearly a decade, the Fed's [benchmark rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate) will be going up, citing a strengthening economy and a need to finally tighten access to credit. 

This announcement comes after years of anticipation of rates rising and [worries](http://www.theworldin.com/article/12774/back-future?fsrc=scn/fb/wi/bl/ed/) that given low rates, monetary policy may be becoming less and less effective. The rise in rates also exists in the context of [growing concerns](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-14/the-next-recession-is-coming-big-deal) that another recession is on the horizon.

"What specific crimes, misdeeds or improprieties are alleged to have been committed under the ""Obamagate"" moniker and what evidence is there to support or oppose those allegations?","Hello.

There have been various news articles recently about a supposed scandal referred to as ""Obamagate,"" which seems to have something to do with events that took place back in 2016. Here are some examples:

1) Example of a piece mostly putting this into the context of original Obama-Trump conflict, the birther episode: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/obamagate-birtherism-all-over-again/611692/

2) Another piece, which dismisses the proposed scandal immediately (paywall warning): https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-absurd-cynicism-of-obamagate/2020/05/15/03464e0a-96ea-11ea-9f5e-56d8239bf9ad_story.html

3) This piece makes Obamagate sound like a really serious scandal. While it does not conflict with the others on the main facts, it spins the same thing very differently. Essentially, the ""unmasking"" considered routine in the other sources is apparently not routine at all: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/fred-fleitz-obamagate-how-obama-administration-apparently-weaponized-intel-agencies-for-political-attacks

I would like to know:

i) What crime (official lawful infraction) is Obama alleged to have committed and what is the evidence supporting or opposing that allegation?

ii) Aside from legality/illegality, what is alleged to be improper about what Obama did?

iii) What statements have been made arguing that Obama's actions were or weren't immoral?

iv) Is this an issue that came out this week, or is it a new narrative based on publicly known information?

v) Aside from embarking on an ambitious research project to find truth every time something happens, is there any way to actually know what is happening during stories like this? Are there go-to sources that can be universally trusted when it comes to deciphering alleged political scandals?

[Last week,](https://www.scribd.com/document/388247581/Judge-s-ruling-on-Bill-5) a judge struck down the portions of the law relating to Toronto's city council as violating s.2(b) and s.2(d) of [the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html)

In response to this ruling, Premier Ford [said](https://globalnews.ca/news/4437313/toronto-council-legal-challenge-decision/) that he intended to pass the law again including an invocation of s. 33 of the Charter, known as the notwithstanding clause, which would override the court's ruling, and make the law take force notwithstanding violation of the charter for a maximum of 5 years.

The Toronto City Council subsequently voted to ask that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoke [the power of disallowance](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/toronto-asking-feds-to-stop-ontario-council-cutting-plan-1.4091993) to block the provincial law from taking force.

"The EU court of justice ruled that private employers can ban the wearing of visible religious symbols, can employers do this in the US, and if not, what would need to change for that to happen?","The court said

>
[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/mar/14/employers-can-ban-staff-from-wearing-headscarves-european-court-rules)

According to the EU website;
>As an EU employer you must:
>
>implement the principle of equal treatment irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief
>
[ec.europa.eu](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/discrimination/rights/index_en.htm) 

So (i believe) the court is making a clear distinction between discrimination based on a person's belief in general and religious expression outside of work, and religious expression while at work, and as long as it's applied equally it's ok, at least in regards to visible religious symbols. 

In the USA the [""free exercise clause""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Exercise_Clause) doesn't seem applicable to this situation and the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Freedom_Restoration_Act)  doesn't seem to apply either. 

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, requires an employer (with at least 15 employees, including private sector, state, and local government employers, as well as employment agencies, unions, and federal government agencies), once it is aware that a religious accommodation is needed, to accommodate an employee whose sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance conflicts with a work requirement. [eeoc.gov](https://www1.eeoc.gov//eeoc/publications/qa_religious_garb_grooming.cfm?renderforprint=1) 

I believe that would mean that currently those employers mentioned above would not be allowed to prohibit an employee from wearing visibile religious symbols. 

Can employers not mentioned, prohibit employees from wearing visible religious symbols? 

And what would it take to allow all employers to prohibit that?"
"Is the 9th Circuit really ""the most liberal and overturned circuit"" in the history of the USA?","After the recent decision by the 9th Circuit to continue barring Trump's immigration restrictions there has been some backlash on conservative leaning media, concerning the history and reputation of the 9th Circuit:

Fox News has recently written an article that says: 

>It routinely is the most overturned court in the U.S. In 2012, the Supreme Court reversed 86 percent of the rulings it reviewed from the ninth.

and that

>Critics deride the court, calling it the “Ninth Circus” and the “Nutty Ninth.”

http://nation.foxnews.com/2017/02/09/ninth-circuit-most-overturned-court-us

The LA Times also has an article about the 9th Circuit from September of last year on the subject of it's alleged left-leaning bias. To quote: 

>The court’s reputation for leftist judicial activism is so legendary that conservative groups mount perennial efforts to split up the 44-judge court, the largest in the nation. In 2011, Newt Gingrich called for abolishing the “anti-American” circuit outright.

The article discusses some of it's historical appointments and liberal biases but comes to the conclusion that it's overturn rate is due to the size of its region and the huge amount of cases it sees. 

On the other hand liberal-leaning news sources (in my opinion) such as ABC take the stance that the liberal reputation of the 9th Circuit is overblown. According to ABC the 9th Circuit appears very liberal because of the large influx of appointees in Carter's administration. ABC says that these ""Carter"" judges are too advanced in age to matter or are simply dead. 

http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/scholars-liberal-reputation-9th-circuit-overblown-45316853

>But some legal scholars say the 9th Circuit's liberal reputation is overblown and that the court has moved to the middle as some of President Jimmy Carter's appointees — who were considered extremely liberal — have taken semi-retired ""senior"" status or passed away.

Other organizations such as the American Bar Association have rated the 9th Circuit very poorly and has given it the second lowest grade of any federal circuit. 

http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/intelprop/magazine/LandslideJan2010_Hofer.authcheckdam.pdf

The 13 Circuits are graded by their performances with respect to Supreme Court decisions in the above .pdf link.  

I noticed that the 9th Circuit is actually the second most overturned court. I also noticed that the 6th and 10th Circuits are of, essentially, the same caliber in terms of being overturned by SCOTUS. 

Only 14/44 of the active and open seats (only 4 vacant seats at the moment) in the 9th Circuit have been appointed by conservative presidents ( Reagan, Bush Jr and Sr, and Nixon). The rest have been appointed by Carter, Clinton, and Obama. 

Is the 9th Circuit truly a liberal biased court, in the way certain media outlets are making them out to be? Do they suffer from overturns because they have the largest geographical spread of any Circuit? What historical context should we consider when discussing the reputation of the 9th Circuit? How much does the size of the 9th Circuit's region really affect the dispositions of this circuit? "
"Is there any evidence, in practice, which suggests that a tax on carbon will have wide-spread economic benefits?","This morning, CNN put out [an article](http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/30/investing/hillary-clinton-climate-change-joseph-stiglitz-advice/) quoting Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has previously worked as the Senior Vice President of the World Bank, [has spoken against the TPP](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/10/in-2016-better-trade-agreements-trans-pacific-partnership), and who wrote in 2007 an article for The Guardian entitled, [""Carbon-Taxing the Rich""](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/07/carbontaxingtherich), in which he laments the shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol -- affirming his belief that a cap-and-trade system is too soft on companies who pollute, and doesn't provide enough deterrent: 

>""...polluting industries like the cap-and-trade system. While it provides them an incentive not to pollute, emission allowances offset much of what they would have to pay under a tax system. Some firms can even make money off the deal. Moreover, Europe has grown used to the concept of cap-and-trade, and many are loathe to try an alternative. Yet, no one has proposed an acceptable set of principles for assigning emission rights.""

What both this article and the CNN article seem to miss is the specific economic analysis of such a system. Europe, as Stiglitz mentioned, has become used to a Cap-and-Trade system, although some countries in Northern Europe had already begun to tax carbon at the time of the article, and some (such as [Ireland](http://www.nesc.ie/assets/files/downloads/project_climate%20change/ucd_workshop/ericgargan.pdf)) have since implemented a system which places a price on emissions. So while there has been hesitation in [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax#Implementation) to introduce such a tax, there ought to be enough of a sample that economic benefits can be seen and analyzed. David Suzuki, [on his website](http://www.davidsuzuki.org/issues/climate-change/science/climate-solutions/carbon-tax-or-cap-and-trade/), mentions that Sweden's economy has more than doubled since they brought in a carbon tax -- though this was in 1991, and the growth might be due to other factors. 

Stiglitz, however, believes the evidence is clear: ""I think a carbon tax would stimulate the economy.""

Is there any evidence to suggest this is true?"
Why did youths vote for remain on Brexit referendum when their unemployment rate is so high?,"[This FT article includes the graph that shows the turnout rate of youth populations](http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2016/06/24/brexit-demographic-divide-eu-referendum-results/). ~~Overwhelming majority of them voted for remain.~~ EDIT: [it appears that actual numbers of youths who voted were very few](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2016/06/brexit-vote-one-chart).

[Youth unemployment rate in the UK has been worsened off](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/22/youth-unemployment-jobless-figure) however. [In 2010 it marked the highest in past 17 years; 19.6%](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/young-unemployed-george-osborne-cuts). Currently it stands at [13.4%](http://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/), seems much more lowered in this five years but nevertheless, double the amount of Germany (6.9%) or [Japan (5.8%)](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/young-unemployed-george-osborne-cuts), and I assume it is still in the higher bracket.

The reason I came up with this question is because of the strong correlation between unemployment, lesser education, low income and the Brexit vote (as shown in the FT article I posted above). If we assume job dissatisfaction was the core issue of Brexit vote, how come youths voted for remain instead of leave?

I acknowledge that youths are generally liberal, and they benefit a lot from free movement and ability to get educations or meet different people in different places of Europe. Nevertheless, if their job condition is not satisfactory, I still wonder why it almost didn't have any noticeable impact.

Just want to point out I'm only an undergrad interested in this issue so a lot of my presumptions may be wrong, and I'm all happy and open to acknowledge and fix my errors. Thanks in advance.

---**EDIT**---

Thanks for many responses. There one point that I want to make it clear:

* I made a debatable premise that people with difficult economic circumstances voted for Brexit. Indeed it doesn't make any sense at a glance as Brexit will hurt the national economy more. But then again, a lot of people speculate that they didn't vote rationally. Also, statistics from the FT article shows strong correlation between lower income / unemployment and Brexit support. Finally, many of their arguments such as about £350 million to be taken back or immigrants taking their jobs, are in my opinion, manifesting that their Brexit vote were stemming from their economic dissatisfaction *they perceived* as resulted from joining the EU."

Some background about myself: I was born in Schenectady, New York and grew up mostly in Vancouver, Canada. I was a reporter for much of my career, and worked for a decade for a British newspaper, the Financial Times, where I was most recently the Washington bureau chief. I came to CFR almost 10 years ago now and wrote a book on U.S. immigration policy after 9/11, called [The Closing of the American Border](http://www.amazon.com/Closing-American-Border-Terrorism-Immigration/dp/0061558400/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1256826006&sr=8-2). I have continued to work on immigration and border security issues, which of course have become no less controversial than when I joined CFR. I also covered U.S. trade policy as a reporter dating back to the negotiations on NAFTA and the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). My recent work at CFR has been heavily focused on U.S. trade policy and American economic competitiveness. 

We have just released a new book called [How America Stacks Up](http://www.cfr.org/competitiveness/america-stacks-up/p37438?cid=soc-Reddit-in-Alden_AMA-How_America_Stacks_Up), which looks at how the United States compares with other advanced economies on a range of policies that are critical for success in global economic competition – such as education, infrastructure, tax policy, worker retraining and innovation. We told the story in part through the use of infographics that distill the big conclusions in graphic form, and I encourage you to have a look. 

All of my publications can be found [here](http://www.cfr.org/experts/economics-immigration-trade-competitiveness/edward-alden/b2472#publications), so feel free to browse beforehand if you have the time.

I’ll be on starting at 12:00 p.m. EST and answering questions through 2:00 p.m. EST. I’ll try my best to get to all of your questions. 

To stay connected, you can read our blog and our publications at: [http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/](http://blogs.cfr.org/renewing-america/).

What exactly can Obama do against Russia during his last few weeks in office?,As a reprisal against the [Russian influencing of the 2016 election](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/us/obama-russia-election-hack.html)?
Why is the two party system in the US so persistent?,"In the history of the US, there have pretty much always been exactly two major parties.  A few parties have risen and fallen over the history of the US, but the two-party balance has been remarkably consistent.  For instance, [there are very few periods where any substantial number of third party members hold seats in the House](http://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/) and third party movements such as the [Know-Nothing party,](http://www.britannica.com/topic/Know-Nothing-party) and the [Bull Moose party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_\(United_States,_1912\)) have been remarkably short lived.

Other countries which use first past the post legislative elections such as Canada and the UK have had persistent third parties at the national level, with the [Liberal Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats) in the UK and [New Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party) in Canada both having substantial enough electoral success even in countries where there are two more dominant national parties.

What are the constitutional or cultural forces which have led to the persistence of only two major national parties existing at a time?"
Is what Rep. Tom Price did by buying stocks and introducing legislation shortly afterwards illegal/unethical?,"By now most of you have read or heard of this article from CNN:

http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/tom-price-bill-aiding-company/

> Rep. Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Price bought between $1,001 to $15,000 worth of shares last March in Zimmer Biomet, according to House records reviewed by CNN. Less than a week after the transaction, the Georgia Republican congressman introduced the HIP Act, legislation that would have delayed until 2018 a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation that industry analysts warned would significantly hurt Zimmer Biomet financially once fully implemented. After Price offered his bill to provide Zimmer Biomet and other companies relief from the CMS regulation, the company's political action committee donated to the congressman's reelection campaign, records show.

------------------------------

So this article establishes that Tom Price bought shares of stock in Zimmer Biomet in March, introduced legislation particularly shielding it from CMS regulations less than a week later, AND Zimmer Biomet contributed to Price's campaign re-election bid.

**COUNTER ARGUMENT**

Yesterday I read a twitter thread from one of Price's former staffers, and her claims are the following:

http://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2017/01/17/journalistic-malpractice-ellen-carmichael-debunks-cnn-story-on-rep-tom-price-stock-purchase/

> @RepTomPrice has a Morgan Stanley brokered-directed stock portfolio. He is not personally engaged in trades made on his behalf.

> In March 2016, his broker rebalanced his portfolio and included the purchase of $2,697.74 Zimmer Biomet stock, among others

> Price was unaware of March 17 stock purchase until April 4. He immediately disclosed his financials on April 15, 2016, 11 days later.

> CNN says that @RepTomPrice introduced legislation after purchasing stock. This is demonstrably false. Work on this began in 2015!

---------------------

Essentially her claim is that Tom Price's portfolio isn't managed by him, and he has no knowledge of stocks he purchases. She claims his broker purchased the stock on March 17, made aware of it on April 4, and disclosed his financials on April 15. Furthermore, she claims that since work began on the legislation in September of 2015, there can be no conflict of interest because he hadn't purchased stocks yet.

This, for me, raises a few questions:

* Could Tom Price have struck his name from the legislation to completely remove himself once he learned he had bought stocks in their company?

* Is there any way to verify that Tom Price truly has no knowledge of what his broker does with his stock portfolio? What's stopping Price from just calling up his broker and saying ""Hey buy these stocks I'm about to pass this legislation""?

* Can people still be held ethically liable if they have a broker making stock purchases on their behalf?

* And lastly, with the evidence provided here, does anyone have enough legal expertise to conclude that what Tom Price did was illegal/unethical?

-----------------------

**UPDATE**

Tom Price admitted under oath during his confirmation hearing that he personally chose to buy stocks in an Australian biotech firm, directly contradicting the counter-argument above and the statement from Trump's transition team.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-price-stock-trades_us_587f9ec5e4b0cf0ae8813191?hjoaa6emrnai1nstt9

> WASHINGTON ― Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Health and Human Services, admitted on Wednesday that he decided to buy stock in an Australian biotech firm after receiving information from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), a board member of that company.

> Price’s answer about when he decided to buy stock in Innate Immunotherapeutics came in response to a back-and-forth in which Murray recounted a private conversation she had had with the congressman.
>“You made the decision to purchase that stock, not a broker. Yes or no?” Murray asked at Price’s confirmation hearing.
>“That was a decision that I made, yes,” Price said.
>“You were offered an opportunity to purchase stock at a lower price than was available to the general public,” Murray said. “Yes or no?”
>“I don’t know that it was,” Price responded. “It was the same price that everybody paid for the private placement offering.”"
Did the Clinton Campaign Break Campaign Finance Law?,"The Sanders Campaign has posted a [public letter](https://berniesanders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Bernie-2016-Letter-to-DNC-1.pdf) to DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz citing their belief that the Hillary Victory Fund violated the FEC.

> The Hillary Victory Fund has reported receiving several individual contributions in amounts as high as $354,400 or more, which is over 130 times the $2,700 limit that applies for contributions to Secretary Clinton's campaign. Bernie 2016 is particularly concerned that these extremely large-dollar individual contributions have been used by the Hillary Victory Fund to pay for more than $7.8 million in direct mail efforts and over $8.6 million in online advertising, both of which appear to benefit only HFA by generating low-dollar contributions that flow only to HFA, rather than to the DNC or any of the participating state party committees.

Here is a [Financial Summary of the Hillary Victory Fund] (http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=C00586537&tabIndex=1) via the FEC. 

**Is the Sanders Campaign's allegations that the Clinton Campaign broke Campaign Finance Law true?**"
I am interested in a general discussion about Merrick Garland's nomination to SCOTUS.,"As many of you likely saw, Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the supreme court today.

Newsweek has an exhaustive resume here:

http://www.newsweek.com/who-merrick-garland-complete-legal-resume-437479

General consensus on the other political subreddits is that Garland is a centrist, with one exception being a more liberal stance on gun rights.  The NY Times, however, puts him squarely in the liberal camp:

http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/16/us/politics/garland-supreme-court-nomination.html

His nomination obviously has a lot of implications for the court (should he be confirmed), for the election, and for the potential of affecting the future makeup of the senate (should congress continue down their current strategic path).  I am interested in hearing the community's thoughts on his nomination.
