Is it me or getting a job is really hard getting a job,"Graduated last year in Computer Science and GIS from a good college. Applying heaps of jobs from January till today and all I got is a ""Thank you for applying, unfortunately.."" response of rejection letter.

Even in January it is already difficult to even get a job, now with the coronavirus and recession I felt like this is like playing life on hard mode. Sorry If you gotta read this, I just gotta rent on my thoughts for being unemployed for way too long. For anyone who is on the same boat as me, let's hope the best will come.

Edit: thank you for so many kind words and tips, also I should've mention that I live in a small city in New Zealand and job itself is already quite limited. So now in the meantime, I'm improving my portfolio and thinking of doing some sort of freelancing."
"I feel traumatized after my ""first"" job after college","Okay, I graduated in 2018 so this happened nearly two years ago but it's something that has stayed with me since, and I don't know how to seek past it. First off, I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this, if anyone could direct me to where this would be more appropriate, please do so!

&#x200B;

In 2018, I graduated with a degree in supply chain, job search was extremely hard but somehow I landed an inventory planner role at a small-mid food/trading company. Now this job was a disaster for me. There wasn't any kind of onboarding that allowed me to be acquainted with the operations of the company, I was given so much information and responsibilities that I could not retain everything, and it seemed like I was asking very stupid questions. My excel skills was very subpar at the time too, I never learned more beyond the excel I used at school. I had to google to learn how to do things on Excel on the job and the manager was very frustrated at me and he told me point blank that ""I thought you graduated from a good business school, what happened? Did you lie about your credentials?"" I was flabbergasted. He handed me a supply chain for dummies book and told me to study it, and it hurt my self worth a lot. I WAS passionate about supply chain and still retained a lot of things I learned at school, however I thought it was okay to not remember/know everything and that you would learn on the job?

&#x200B;

Anyway, after a week, I knew that place couldn't be for me and we mutually decided to part ways as I knew he'd let me go sooner or less. Job search after that became even harder than it was before, I felt worthless and unconfident to start a career in supply chain, I went on so many interviews and failed to secure a position in the field. I am now working in an unrelated career path. It's a humble career, but I feel like I could do more with myself and get paid a lot more, especially since I have a double major in supply chain and information systems. But the thing is, that ""first"" job greatly traumatizes me to this day and I feel like I could never be good to work in an analyst or planner role within supply chain. COVID 19 has really set me back this year as well, I wanted it to be the year where I'd leave my current job and seek a job in supply chain, but right now I care a lot about job security. I don't want to land a job in supply chain and have it end up like my first job, with me having to leave or be let go because I am unqualified.

&#x200B;

Did anyone ever have this problem or feeling when you had you first job after college, where you wholly unprepared and unqualified?

&#x200B;

EDIT: First off -- wow, thank you everyone for your incredible support. I wrote this post not knowing I'd get this many responses. It's hard for me to formulate my thoughts and reply to each post, but I have read all of your responses and will take your advice to heart. I'm glad to know that I wasn't the only one going through this (I actually shouldn't say glad, it's sad that it's happened to so many people as well). It really just seems like I was very unlucky in my first job and what happened was not at all my fault. I just need to muster up the courage to start applying everywhere again and realize that any good company will have proper onboarding process and will offer me the support I need to adjust and fit well in the company."
Lost a great job offer and it was my fault. Could use advice or encouragement going forward.,"Hi guys, this is my first post here. I (28f) wanted to get some advice or encouragement from you guys because I'm sure a lot of you are all in the same job hunting boat right now. Well end of May I got a job offer after being let go from my last company. It was the perfect position. It was work from home, it matched my Salary, full benefits, great pto, you get the idea. I impressed in the interview and they loved that I had my series 6 and 63 licenses. So I go through the drug test and background check. Well the HR person emailed me saying she couldn't  verify my education. I told her no worries, id contact my school and get it sorted. I talked to an advisor  and it turns out...I never finished my general associates degree. I was off by a few credits. 

I was 19 at the time, I thought I had finished all the credits, and I was getting married that same month. With all that on my plate I thought well when I want a copy of my degree I'll just call. I feel so stupid now. No jobs that I had between then and up til now ever questioned my degree, so I didn't  think to check myself. That is my own fault and I completely  understand. I'm going back to finish the last few classes. However, now as far as job hunting...I screwed myself. I can't have that on my resume or application  anymore. I have all the certifications and licenses that I did obtian through my previous employer, which looks great to potential jobs, but I'm afraid my lack of even just a 2 year degree is going to ruin any chance I have. 

Well needless to say, the company rescinded their offer, even after I gave an explanation. I'm crushed. I was perfect for the job. It was such a step up from my previous job and i felt like i was finally moving up in my career. Normally I'd just be disappointed and think well there's plenty of big companies I can apply to. Now that I know I don't have my degree I have no confidence that I even stand a chance. I can't even talk to anyone in my family about it, they all think I have my associates and I'm just too embarrassed to tell them. I feel absolutely awful and worthless. 

I'm making a plan to finish my courses and I'm still sending out my resume. I just am so disappointed with myself. Anyone else ever been through this?"
Resubmitting resume after denial to show perseverance,"I see a lot of LinkedIn influencers going viral with posts like “we hired this person for their perseverance” or “if I gave you a million dollars, could you find the team leads email? The hiring managers?” Etc. 

Has anybody actually successfully pulled something like that off? Like, LinkedIn stalking their profile and sending a personal email? 

I’m thinking about resubmitting my resume to this job and this time reaching out to the hiring manager. Think I can pull it off as some display of “perseverance” with the right approach?"
Any advice on how to not take rejections personally?,"
“We regret to inform you that..” or just outright getting ghosted. Feels like I’m on tinder only being rejected means I don’t have money."
I got rejected for a job and now being reconsidered,"Hi everyone

As the title says, I applied for a job internally and before the interview stage I got rejected on Wednesday and then yesterday (Thursday) I got an email saying that my application is being reconsidered. Does this mean I am going to get an interview or could I still be rejected again before interviewing?"
Asking reasons as to why I got rejected,"Hi Reddit. I need advices, guys. Basically what the title says. A little backstory. I had a Zoom interview one month ago, then one week ago I got called in for a face-to-face interview, in which the interviewers told me they were very interested in my profile, skillset and experience, leading me to believe it almost was a done deal. Yesterday I got an email (at 11.41 pm on a Friday night) saying they decided not to offer me the position. To say I am disappointed it’s un understatement. The way they talked to me and praised my working profile, really led me to believe I was the guy they were looking for. Maybe I misread the situation, I do not know. Anyhow, I was very interested in the position. I would like to call the interviewer and simply ask him what were the main reasons why I got rejected. Was my long period of notice at my current job (2 months), so they went for someone who was going to be available earlier than me? Was the money I asked too much for their budget? My mind is spiraling right now. I would like to call just to understand what I don’t have to do/say the next time I got lucky to get a recruiting opportunity.
Thank you very much for your advice."
"Hiring manager ""accidentally"" offered me the position—they meant to hire another candidate","Hi all,

I interviewed for a job this past Tuesday. Shortly after, I emailed my interviewers, including the hiring manager, to thank them for their time. On Wednesday, I received an email (directed to me) from the hiring manager that said I was being offered the position—I was so excited! I emailed back immediately to let them know I accepted their offer and I even received a response saying they were ""happy"" to have me ""on board."" 

However, today I got a voicemail/email saying that I was offered the position by accident, that it was an email/working-from-home ""glitch."" I'm absolutely stunned and devasted. 

Here is the email I received:

""Hi \_\_\_\_,

I am back in the office today and just left you a message.  I made a huge error in saying we've offered you the position. Working from home, I had computer glitches and made an error. Given that I do want to let you know you're high on our list, but still waiting to hear back from everyone on the team about ranking.  I am deeply sorry for this mistake and hope you understand. Please call me if you have any questions.""

Like I said, I'm stunned and so, so sad about this. Any tips for how I should respond? I can't think clearly right now and I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm a grad student (graduating in May) and was so stoked to know what my next steps are. Is this worth complaining to their HR manager about?

Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: I was accidentally emailed the job offer; it was meant for someone else."
"I was unemployed for 3 years, and it's wrecking my chances of now getting a job. Any advice is helpful","I have a useless BA in political science from the UC system. I worked at a home improvement company for 2ish years after college, and then I was laid off.

Since being laid off, which has now been 3 years, I've been day trading stocks, mostly options, and I've been living off of that. I'm not rich, but day trading was paying rent and the bills.

When the market heavily went down back in march, I put my cash into VOO and BRK.B. My plan is to just leave it there for a long time. I do not want to day trade anymore. I want a ""real job.""

I have applied to a lot of jobs, and I've gotten phone interviews. But every time I bring up my liberal arts degree, the interview immediately goes south.

Every single time I'm asked the dreaded question of: what have you been doing the past 3 years? It immediately goes south when I tell them I was buying and selling stocks / reading quarterly reports. When I tell them I've now put my money into a safe tech ETF / berk, and I'm looking for a 9-5 job, I always get an awkward weird silence then never hear back from them.

I applied for a book keeping position that laughed when I said I was a former day trader.  The ironic thing was the job only paid 14 an hour.  I was averaging 200 a day with stocks (minus tax).

So what in the heck do I do? I had a phone screen at the job agency and the lady flat out told me they don't place people who've been unemployed for longer than 6 months.

Am I just destined to be an unemployable loser this life? I have assets, but I'm now cash poor so I need a job.

Any thoughts would be lovely. Feel free to be brutal.  I hear it all the time from my family."
"Got rejected from a job I told everyone I was going to get, Feel like an idiot","I’ve spent the last 3 years of my life working an entry level clerical accounts receivable job where I’m pretty much just a glorified collections specialist. I’ve tried applying for internal promotions, but my lack of seniority and inability to reference my current job as relevant experience prevents me from moving up. My boss refuses to give me any kind of stretch assignments with other teams to pad my experience. I get paid hourly and make $35K/year; I live paycheck to paycheck. My company is run so bureaucratically and I hate clocking in and out every day like a common wage slave. I’m so miserable here.

A job for a company in a different state opened up about 2 months ago, and I applied for it. I actually know a lot of the people at that company and have some very good relationships with the employees, even the hiring manager. The interview went extremely well overall. I did poorly on the Excel test I was given, but they seemed to care a lot more about the interview itself, and the hiring manager said that a lot of applicants tend not to do well on the test. I was so confident I was going to get it that as soon as I got back I couldn’t stop talking to my coworkers about it. My supervisor was also positive I was going to get it that she actually had me train a potential replacement for my current job.

Well, my coworker has similarly good relations with this company as well and applied to the same job, unbeknownst to me. He’s a few years younger than me and has only worked here for less than a year, so he has much less experience than me. Apparently he scored perfectly on the Excel test and rocked the interview. We interviewed 3 weeks ago, and last week when I got my rejection email he got an offer letter. This job was the biggest opportunity of my life, and I feel like such an idiot after bragging about it for the past several weeks to all my friends and coworkers. I think I was probably the runner up and would have for sure gotten it if my coworker hadn’t applied. I don’t even know what to do now because my current job is so bad with such an uninteresting title that I have no chance of getting a better job somewhere else other than where I applied. I feel like my best bet now is to keep waiting around here until something opens up internally for me to apply to, but I’ll probably get rejected from that too.

How can I improve my job prospects in the situation that I’m in? Everything I’ve tried has just been a dead end, and I cannot imagine working this horrible dead end job past my twenties."
Rejected within 3 Minutes ??,"I applied for an entry level job. Not my words, the job description said it is an entry level job, for this BIG social media company and according to me I was alright candidate (enough for contesting in interviews atleast) if not good. After applying, I checked my email to star the notification so that i can keep the record of the emails but I see the company has already sent me a rejection email.   


I found it so weird.   


The application had no question which would have an ""automated rejection"" just my CV. I applied for higher positions in the same company (twice) before also and they rejected me.   


My question is Did they read my CV in 3 mins. and reject me (If yes then is being ""Overqualified"" a thing) or big companies have the policy of rejecting applicants if they reject them once."
"I didn't get the job, but one of the interviewer's wants to talk to me again to give advice and discuss the sector. How do I prepare for this?","*repost to make the title more specific*

TD;LR at the bottom.

Hello! 

Background:

I am very soon to be a graduate with a BA Hons in sociology and social policy. In February I applied for a job within my local council to be an admin officer in the housing department which I was super excited about. I didn't hear back and thought I just hadn't gotten it but they phoned me in May for a video interview!

Present:

On Monday, I did the interview with a panel of three and it went quite well, I showed my enthusiasm and knowledge around housing and they seemed to respond. However, I had a feeling I wasn't quite the right candidate.

My gut feeling was confirmed yesterday when I got a phone call to say I was unfortunately, unsuccessful. Yet, the interviewer was impressed with my enthusiasm and stated they didn't want to lose a talented individual, so they wanted to set up a casual video discussion.

This, this caught me by surprise and I wasn't quite sure what to say apart from, yes, please! They asked me if I had any questions already, but I sort of choked as I really wasn't expecting it so I am a bit afraid I came off a bit unwilling, if that makes sense? However, I am so grateful as I was dissapointed not to get the position but to be recognised was immense.


The point:

Basically, how do I not mess this opportunity up and really make the best of it?

Have any of you been in this position before?

TL;DR - I didn't get the job but I have a casual meeting set up with one of the interviewers to talk about the sector and to get advice as well as feedback. How do I make the most of this?"

Is it possible to be over qualified for a internship,"So I’m a university student entering my last year. I need to hunt down an internship. 

I have devoted the last 3 years to building my resumes. Over the last 3 years I have acquired work experience through a medical school, oil companies, political parties and lobby groups. 

After my experience I have had all top ranking people from these organizations advocate for me and say that I am a darn good employee. 

I also have my name published in a university journal for research. Three times actually. 

That information is on my resume. 

This sounds great and all but it most certainly is not. Someone entering their second year of my program is also hunting for a job. She told everyone she applied for it and I happened to apply for it as well. She has 0 prior work or volunteer experience. Well I guess she worked at foot locker for 3 months. Well long story short I didn’t even hear an email back and she was hired without an interview. 

What???? Is it possible to be over qualified

Like I have worked my butt off for the last 3 years. I have skipped personal events, stopped playing sports, and have cut off relationships. All of this just to build my resume into the beast it is today. Now I can’t even hear back from a entry level internship position"
I'm a male and I want to work as a secretary. Am I blackballed?," 

I am a male college graduate who was never able to break into the area I majored in, and six years later, I'm ready to try a different route. While I can do physical labor (I currently do), I would prefer to work in an office type environment in a secretarial type position. I know full well that this is not normal for men, but this would be much easier for an introvert such as myself. From what I have read, men tend to get screened out of such positions. This is technically illegal according to my understanding but impossible to prove. Is there any way I can break through this barrier?

Edit: I'm technology proficient and can type 80-85+ WPM. There's really no reason I shouldn't at least be getting a shot."
I didn't make past the personality test and I don't understand the results,"So I was required to give a personality test for role that I applied for. The results were available to be immediately when I gave the test and they were really disappointing. I got 4 (out of 10) on focus and persistence, which I believe is too less. And I got 1 in teamwork. The test result stated that 'Mr. X would create more problems in a team than solving them'. I am not saying that I am a 10 in team work, maybe a 6 or 7. but a 1 ?! The results were really disappointing and I didn't get called for an interview. But I want to understand why did I get these results? What should I do for next time? Are these results a true reflection of me?"
Do you think I’m going to hear from them back?,"Hello Fellow Redditor,

      I’m about to graduate with an A.A in chemistry and I applied to be a lab technician at a fish farm. I got emailed the basic questions. “Why do you want to work here?”, “What are your strengths?”, “What do you expect for compensation?” I answered all these questions and this was on June 15 and now it’s the 19th. This job is perfect. It’s what I love. It’s super close to home. It’s in the field I want to be in. Do you think I’ll hear from them back? Everyday I wake up expecting an email and I get nothing. I don’t get a phone call either. I have applied to other jobs but this one is my favorite. Should I just stop worrying about it? Has anyone gone through a similar situation?

My manager hasn’t given me any shifts despite making myself available?,Feels bad man because I made myself available June and July month. Just checked to see if I got any hours around June and there  wasn’t any.  I also haven’t worked in like 2-3 months due to a lot of school work which my manager knows about.  I always work a lot in the summertime so I really wanted shifts.  My manager has hired lots of new employees as well. What can I do?
"Got rejected after being led on, encouraged me to apply again in the future and that they would even reach out with opportunities. How likely is this?","About a month after my second interview (with a small state office within a larger division) I got rejected. Before they rejected me they send me 3 emails telling me to wait a little longer hr was taking long (this was unprompted). They called me personally to tell me they loved me but they went with another candidate. The hiring manager said if her spot opens up (she’s going for a promotion) she would love if I applied and that she would send me opportunities. 

I may be just be feeling defeated with what’s going on. I was told something similar at my current job when interviewing for a different division. Then I rode in the elevator with the man who interviewed me, pressed the button for his floor and he asked how I knew....and I said “I interviewed in your office a week and a half ago....” I work for a big federal agency and have been told by employees that changing divisions is practically impossible (management has told me the opposite). So I’m interested to hear if positive rejections ever amount to anything, obviously am still looking but sick of hearing this."
Do previous rejected applications effect new applications when applying online?,"Just wondering if I apply online and get rejected for position A, will there be like a note that may be taken into consideration 2 months later when I apply for Position B with the same company.

Feedback questions after rejection when you work alongside the interviewers,"Hello all,

I recently applied for a position at the company I currently work for, it was for a position that is directly related to the degree I am working on. The experience from the position would have impacted the time frame for professional licensing in the career field. I was recently notified that I did not get the position, but was told that I was the runner up and really impressed those I was interviewed by. Since I work in the department already and somewhat close to those I was interviewed by, I am finding it difficult to come to terms with the decision that was made, I suppose it is the norm of rejection. I am taking it a bit personal since once this pandemic is over and we return to the office I will see those I was interviewed by again. It’ll be a while before that happens and I think I’ll be fine and over it by then. For now I come to ask for some advice from you all, I have asked for interview feedback and was asked to set up a meeting by one of the interviewers, scheduled a couple weeks from now. What questions should I be asking? I am going to stay professional no matter what. I just don’t really know what I should be asking. All I can think of is “why not me?” I’ve gotten good feedback from the other interviewers through e-mail and from superiors who were privy to some direct information so I really don’t know what to expect. Thank you all for your time."
How do I get around the issue of lack of experience?,"I recently quit my 2 and a 1/2 yr job as a Sales Consultant due to the company I worked for changing ownership, and the new contract offering reduced hours and pay rate. I have qualifications in IT and Financial Services, but none of the Administration or Sales positions I have applied for have lead to interviews or even a simple 'get to know you' phone call. I feel it may be my lack of experience, but I am the type of person who learns very fast and have an IQ of 132. How do I convey my determination to succeed and finally get to the interview stage? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)"
"Phone interview two weeks ago; said they’d call in a week, didn’t call me so I called and left a voicemail. Still haven’t heard back. Should I suspect I didn’t get it?","Two weeks ago (a Wednesday) I had my second phone interview for a company. At the end of the interview they said they’d call next Wednesday. 

So I stayed glued to my phone all day when Wednesday rolled around and didn’t hear anything from them. 

I ended up waiting until Friday to call for an update about the candidacy but received the voicemail box so I left a message. 

It’s now coming up on a week after they said they’d call me. Should I suspect that I didn’t get the position or should I be patient?"

[UK] Question about GCSEs/Work Gaps and your CV,"If I gave full details this would honestly turn into an essay, as the last few years have been a bit complicated for me, but my question is fairly simple:

I have three large gaps of unemployment (Some time in 1999-2001, Jan 2013-Sept 2014, and Oct 2017-Present Day, I travelled from Sept 2019-May 2020), and I have bad GCSEs (mostly Cs, some Ds, and an E in Maths cos I'm dyscalculate).

I know how to word my job descriptions and skill-sets to sound impressive, don't need advice with that - but those gaps and that bad education just screws me over. How do I make THEM sound impressive, or at least less bad?

Despite having 10 years experience as a Legal Sec, and 2 years as a Support Worker in a hospital, I can't get a job because they want *recent* experience and all these certificates and quals that I just don't have and can't afford to get.

I get nothing but rejections. 300+ jobs since 2017, two interviews that lasted like 5 minutes each, and about 50 rejections. The rest were ignored entirely.

Thoughts, please?"
Got rejected from the only job i was qualified for,"Hi,

I am currently about to become a new grad graduating from computer science and last summer i did my internship as a janitor. I really enjoyed it and learned about cs stuff. I was thinking about going full time as a janitor after I graduate so when I knew I was graduating, I asked my boss if I could go full time but it turns out that they arent hiring and laid off all their interns cus of the pandemic . This absolutely sucked because a janitor was the only software position I qualified for and now I dont know what to do. Im thinking about getting a job at McDonalds but I will need beg in front of the manager to get the job. Any thoughts as to what I should do?"
Has anyone else been rejected by the Google hiring committee without any feedback?,"I applied at Google for an entry level software engineering role for which I studied my bum off and I went through 3 stages of interviews. 

I recently received an email from my recruiter telling me that the hiring committee decided not to move forward with my candidacy. 

I emailed my recruiter back to thank her and ask if I could receive any feedback on how I could improve but, her response was that she doesn't get any feedback from the hiring committee, only that she gets a recommendation on next steps from the hiring team and that is all. 

I'm left with questions..

1) is it good that I made it all the way to the hiring committee? 

2) Does the fact that I made it to the hiring committee mean that I was recommended by all 3 of my interviewers? I mean I could've simply been rejected at any prior interview..

Has anyone else been through something similar?"
“We do not provide interview feedback.”,"I got a rejection after a first round interview at a company I really wanted. When I asked for feedback, they just told me “we do not provide interview feedback.” Is there a good reason why they won’t? I feel like if I took the time to interview, the least you could do is let me know what happened that turned you off."
Was rejected for not having enough experience in a particular area,"I had two interviews with an organization since quarantine started. I knew one of the interviewers and he had encouraged me to apply for the communications manager position, he had told me I would be suited for the position, etc. So I did. I had an interview with him and then an interview with a higher up.

He has kept me updated throughout the process and gave me some tips to focus on for the second interview and today I learned I won't be moving onto the third because I lack experience in one particular area - an area which, to my understanding, is pretty easy to learn. A quick google search tells me I provided all the right information about the subject in my second interview. He also didn't warn me that the second interview would focus so much on this particular area. Of course, he doesn't owe me any information but given what he had told me before I obviously assumed he knew tip me off.

I'm just feeling a lot of things, mostly anxiety as I enter the job market at 26 with my MA in the middle of this crazy pandemic. He said he hoped I wasn't holding out for the position, and I wasn't, it's just all the other places put a hold on hiring so...

I didn't have any questions at the time he told me, but now I do. I'm holding off a couple days to blow off steam before texting him with some questions. He used to be a recruiter so I trust him with info. 

I want to know how one gains experience in a particular area when everything else was good? I know it wasn't a guaranteed job but I still think I expected me. He says he wants to hang out and stuff, he's new to the city, blah blah blah. Idk, I just have so many feelings.

Any advice when it comes to this? I'm sorry if this is vague, I needed somewhere to get some of this out there."
"Received a rejection email, with potential for another position? How should I reply?","Hi guys,   


For context, I applied for a position at an international company and after three rounds and some amount of time, I received a rejection email. The email was from one of the person who interviewed me, and below are just some of the things mentioned, quote on quote:  


*""Unfortunately, although you were in our final three candidates, we have had to make the difficult decision to offer the role to the candidate who had more relevant experience. However you really were an exceptional candidate and I do hope you will consider other openings at \[COMPANY\] in the future.""*  


This I understood, as I was a fresh graduate with only internships under my belt. The people who interviewed me were exceptionally nice and honest, which I deeply appreciated. So I wasn't too sad when I received the rejection email. However, the email ends with:

*""On a personal note, if you'd ever like to speak to me about any other roles that we post then I'm always happy to chat. I'm aware you've also applied for the \[XXX SPECIFIC ROLE I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN\] role so I will look forward to reviewing that application.""*  


On another occasion (on the phone) prior to the rejection email, he also mentioned that he is aware and has noted I've applied for this specific \[XXX\] role. I am also more interested in this role than the previous one I got rejected for, actually. My question is, how should I reply and indicate my interest? Also, how should one graciously and genuinely thank the interviewers for their time and honesty? I thoroughly enjoyed all three interview rounds I had with the people who interviewed me.  


Any advice is appreciated!"
Am I at a disadvantage?,"So I'm 18 now, but I haven't gotten a job yet. I tried applying to several part-time entry-level positions in my city, but I got nothing for it, no interviews or anything. While I tried to remain positive about my chances, I decided to focus more on my extracurriculars in school, as well as my grades so I could get into my desired discipline in university. Even throughout my first year, I applied to several entry-level positions, and yet I received nothing again, which began to really worry me, as most of my friends by then had a job, or had previously worked part-time. I am feeling really stressed out and increasingly frustrated by this, not only because I'm not getting hired, but also because several people I know are still getting hired, so what exactly am I doing wrong? And am I at a disadvantage because of this?"
Why Am I Not Getting Interviews or Offers?,"I’ve been trying to leave my current retail job for a few months now and the whole virus thing has made things worse. I’ve been applying like crazy to places and I’m not getting interviews or responses back. I’ve been working in retail for 2 years. I have experience has a COS (check-out supervisor), cashier, stocker and I work trucks at my current job. I have an Associate’s degree and am currently going for my bachelor. My availability is 100% open and I’m more than willing to work all weekends/holidays. What am I doing wrong?

I do have a gap in my resume for about a year. I broke my foot at work and was essentially fired for it. I was unable to find work for the 6 months after and I didn’t include that job on my resume because I left in a horrible way. Could this be it?"
Having a astoundingly hard time leaving retail,"To begin with...

A year ago I had a job working in an office and I LOVED IT and was good at it. Got laid off. Over the last 7 years I have worked in retail on top of that and since that lay off had to go back to full time retail. I just absolutely need a career change.

I am going back to school for Paralegal Studies after nursing school didn't work out, but I can't even seem to find an entry level position in the legal field in my area. I have work ethic, I'm motivated, I show up and do my darn best everyday. I take feedback and try to improve everyday.

I've taught myself to use intermediate excel, word, and outlook functions. I'm fantastic with customer service and building connections and have been recognized by my company several times and by  customers.

I've had just rejection after rejection lately, or I am getting an interview right away, going through several interviews, then being rejected.

I have limited income to spend money on getting certified in Microsoft products, etc.

Beyond building a portfolio I'm so unsure of what to do. I've been trying since mid December to find work."
Feedback from Rejected Internal Position,"So I finally received feedback after asking a month ago about why I wasn’t selected for an internal position and I am more annoyed and bitter then before.  The position in question was the next higher up position in our department and I was the only one who was internal.  At first my boss said it would just need to be posted three days as an internal posting but then no action was taken to interview for it for months.  I finally get my interview scheduled directly after multiple meetings by my boss so that I wasn’t even able to prepare.  On top of this, the interview committee is made up only of my boss and coworker.  I thought the interview went as well as could be, but turns out I didn’t have the skills she was looking for based on her vision for the position which wasn’t even how the job description read.

Anyways after asking for feedback when I was rejected and receiving no acknowledgement on the matter, suddenly I get my answer when it is now time to train people.  My boss’ answers felt like excuses to me.  She claimed her committee was neutral, but I don’t know how that was possible when the two that interviewed me were my bosses and she even stated she would have liked to hear more of my examples from my current role even though I provided examples from all of my previous positions.  What really got me was the statement that she felt I did not offer to help out enough and learn new areas of the office.  This was like a slap in the face as I have frequently asked to learn new things with no reply from either of them.  Additionally, apparently she claims she knows I do a great job and she doesn’t need to question my work but feels I don’t communicate to her.  When I started and anytime I take on a project she has always said I don’t need to keep her informed of every step, yet now she claims she wants project check in emails all of the time.  I feel I always either tell one or the other how projects are and what is complete, so I feel the communication problem is on her side.  

I’m just frustrated because even though I stated my feelings on everything and my place in our hierarchy I still feel like she doesn’t get it.  It apparently is an unreasonable request that either of my two bosses take on any lower duties that are outside their job responsibilities but since I’m apparently just a great hand at my current job, I get to do my duties and the training duties of the job I didn’t get without getting paid more.

Frustrated."
"Job Offer Withdrawn, devastated.","I feel so lost and so down. I just need advice or someone to listen to my story.

I'm in an awful job run by a bully. I wanted to move into a new industry Digital PR which is a side step from what I currently do, Digital Marketing. Got in touch with a company who already knew me and very kindly offered me a casual interview. That went pretty well and then I completed a task they  had asked for, to which they replied very quickly saying 'i'd made it really easy for them, that was a great project and you've got the job.' I was ecstatic, I can't tell you how happy I was, I had my whole new life there set in my head.

Unfortunately, here's where I went wrong. I always thought this was a time to negotiate. I currently earn £26k, and I know if I was going on to another digital marketing job I could easily now earn £30k. However, I had expressed to them in my interview before that I understand that 30k might not be possible as I was moving into a slightly different industy without the direct experience, so I said I just didn't want to go below my current salary. 

In their offer, they offered me £26k with it going up to £27k after 6 month probation. I expressed my joy and keeness but asked if there was any way for a 27k start with it going up to 28k. Yes, I got greedy, I hate myself for it now. Also the job they had advertised for was 'digital pr exec' but when they offered me it they said 'junior digital pr exec' and I asked if we could keep it to the original title I had applied for as I didn't want it to appear like a step back in my career.

They retracted their offer. They explained why and I get it. To them they were already taking a bit of a risk on me as it was a different industry that I didn't have direct experience in and they believed they were being very generous to match my currently salary for what they consider a junior role. They said they worried I wasn't thinking of it as a long term job because of my salary expectations.

The thing is, if they had just said we can't go above our offer, I would have said no problem I'd like to take it anyway. I even replied to their rejection after telling them this, in case there was any saving it, but they still said sorry but no.

I'm devastated, I'm kicking myself and I just feel so lost now to be back to my awful job when it was right there in my hand."
Rejected from dream company twice :(,"Five months ago, I applied to a position at the dream company I want to work at. Didnt get the job but was one of the top 6 candidates.
A few weeks ago I interviewed with a different team but same company. I just found out I didnt make the cut again.

Crazy thing is, I still have an interview at this same company again next week. Same position different team. I really hope I get it but Im worried.
Is it a good sign they are keeping me to interview? If I dont make it will I get black listed? 

Ive gotten great feedback both times the recruiter said its competitive but I did very well. It seems like I dont have enough experience compared to others. Its really frustrating.


-Edit: thank you everyone for your kind comments and helpful advice!"
Need help - New grad almost no interviews,"I’ve reached a point where I’m very disheartened and confused about my job search. I’ve applied to 100 positions but only had 3 interviews (from prior connections) that resulted in stating they wanted someone to start immediately.

I will be graduating in May with a business undergrad degree from a top 20 US business school with a 3.5+ GPA. I’ve had 4 internships, two of which were at top tech companies and two others at high growth startups. I have decent leadership, several merit scholarships, and won case competitions. I thought there might have been problems with my resume, but I’ve had it looked over by two tech recruiters, my previous boss, and a university counselor and they couldn’t find anything wrong with it/ all seemed to be impressed. Yet I can’t get interviews, even where I’ve contacted recruiters over LinkedIn directly, met the company at networking events, or had a referral. 

People I ask for advice sometimes say you have great experience you’ll do fine and that’s really not helpful because I’m not doing fine in my job search. I’m tailoring my cover letter to each job and am a US citizen. What else am I not doing?

At this point I’m at my wits end. I don’t want to be making the same mistakes over and over again. Does anyone have advice on getting the interview? Also now that most new grad programs are closed what can I even apply to if I’m interested in tech."
College physics student denied from fast food,"Explanatory story: 
I’m a college student, who worked for a year after high school due to not having the financial ability to pay for college. (I refused to go into too much debt, I’m financially educated, and won’t dig myself a pit)

After being accepted to university, and willing myself back into school, I had to quit my job (full time day job) so I could attend classes. 

I’m now in a position where I have to rent an apartment, and pay other expenses, on top of school. And need to get another job as money is running out.

I’m majoring in Physics, and Music Education (I know I know, I’m debating between physicist or band director, whichever makes me happier) 

And I have 2 previous jobs who would give good recommendations, one being a physical labor full time job. 

So, back on track. I’m being denied from FAST FOOD restaurants with this resume. An unnamed drink place better hire Albert Einstein to make their smoothies, because idk who else is more qualified.

How is a college student supposed to support themselves if fast food won’t even hire them?? Am I just immensely unlucky in this situation and patience is in order?


TLDR: Hardworking college student with lots of good job experience being denied from fast food restaurants, and simple entry level jobs for some reason."
Can a company blacklist you in an entire industry?,"I understand if it's a small industry it is possible, but I am talking about a big industry such as construction in a major city. Is there like a website or document shared by all companies that may have blacklisted employee names?"
Feeling very discouraged after first job interview rejection?,"
Hey guys, 

I’m graduating this spring with a bachelor’s degree in health sciences. I have 4 years sales experience at Nordstrom as a top seller, along healthcare experience as a primary care intern. I recently had an interview with a genetic testing company (prenatal testing), for an associate sales rep position. I truly felt like the interview went really well. I was very enthusiastic about the position, and I felt like I connected well with the person I was interviewing with. Our convo was upbeat, I asked a lot of questions, and there was no awkward silence during the 45 minutes we spoke.
Today I got a call and was told they are no longer going to consider me a candidate for this position, primarily due to my lack of experience as a recent college grad. The recruiter then told me that the only feedback they could give me is to have “a little bit more energy”, which completely caught me off guard. Although I would describe myself as outgoing and a people-person, I definitely have a calm demeanor. I don’t have a super hyper personality all the time, but I can’t change that. I feel very discouraged and like I’m not cut out for a career in medical sales because of this. I know this was my very first interview, but Im finding myself questioning my abilities. Does anyone have any advice out there? Or similar stories to share?"
Has anyone ever received a strange job rejection email?,"I applied to a position at a local business weeks ago and since they never responded I figured I didnt get the job and I moved on. Today I received a rejection email from the company and I figured it was just the normal rejection email until I opened it. 

The email started like a basic rejection email, but then they went on to describe how great the person they ended up hiring was. They literally described their career background, how much more experience they have, and even the type of degree they have! Instead of being annoyed I started laughing at how ridiculous the email was. It was sent by the owner and I wonder if they realize how unprofessional they sound. That was definitely the weirdest rejection email I have ever received. I'm glad I didn't end up working there."
Did I get rejected? If not should I wait?,"I went through 4 rounds of interviews with this Japanese IT firm for a sales role. During my last round of interview last week, the managing director told me that he is making a trip to japan to confirm with the HQ before he can confirm my hire.

Today he tells my recruiter, because of the caronavirus situation in Japan, the HQ in Japan is freezing the hiring process until June. My recruiter says, if i am still available and interested in June, she will push my profile to this company again.

I have a job now but I absolutely hate my job. I asked the recruiter, if they liked me as a candidate... she said that I was the only candidate to make it all the way to the last round and they were very serious about hiring me.

I really wanted this job but i am not sure to make of this scenario. I am very disappointed."
College age son having trouble getting jobs at college.

Responding to job application rejection letters is worth it!!!,"I'm literally over-the-moon right now!

My wife and I recently relocated, and finding a steady job in this area's market has been scarce. I've got plenty of experience in my field but I only got accepted for two job offers that paid really low and the commute was far away. One company that's much closer and pays much better posted a job and to my surprise, I didn't get it. I received a very generic email saying:

""Dear applicant, unfortunately, we've decided to hire another candidate to fill our position for JOB at ABC company. We've greatly appreciated your time and cooperation during the interview process and we will keep you in mind for future considerations.""

When I opened this email, my heart sank to the floor. Against my better judgment, I sent an email reply stating how great the experience was and I asked what I could've improved upon during the process. I also thanked them for future considerations. Crickets. No response by email. Nothing. Almost a week later, my phone rings and it's the recruiting manager who I interviewed with. One of their employees was going on mat leave and they were willing to have me work alongside her before she left for a year. The best part is that they're hiring me permanent full-time... no contract, baby! Signed my offer letter and I start next week. Always take the high road and never give up!!

Social Media Admin Job (sad),"i joined an online school startup as a language partner. I have been talking with the owner via fb messenger too regarding improvements and suggestions. One time he asked me via pm if I want to become an admin of the startup's Social Media acct. Basically all you have to do is answer questions, post announcements, maybe curate some graphics. He asked me for my hourly charge. 

I have never done this sort of freelance job before. I have a full time job as a Social Media Team Lead for an airline though. It's different but somehow related. I was hesitant to really state a specific amount and told him it's up to him. He insisted so i said 1000JPY. 

He also did not mention the number of hours yet. I asked him if it's too much and told him I can charge less the longer the hours. Was it a bad amount? Was it too much?

After that he said he'll think about it. The next morning I saw that one of my fellow language partners now works as an admin for him. I feel sort of sad and disappointed with myself. 

I didnt know how to negotiate. Or perhaps she had a better skill. Idk. Can you please honestly tell me if the amount I mentioned was too much? Thank you."
Tips on staying motivated after getting turned down from interviews.,"Hello, about a month ago i was layed off from my job. its been a struggle these past few weeks during the job search. I have worked for the past 5+ years without being unemployed this is my first month in 5 years being unemployed so its very tough at the moment. The past few weeks i have had some big interviews for some really good jobs. I work in Information Technology and i consider my field to be very competitive i live in a decently populated area of about 100,000 people however it is not the same as being a big city Atlanta, Washington, California where there is more opportunity in the field. I had 3 final interviews the past week 1 job was actually a referral from a friend that works for the company i had really high hopes at getting that job they even had me come in before the final interview to shadow to get used to the systems. Today i received three emails ""thanks for applying but we have decided to move on"" kind of thing from all three jobs today "" today has crushed me which is why i cannot sleep and looking for advice. I guess its back to the drawing board tomorrow."
Mental health and the job search,"I graduated from an Ivy back in June 2019. Since then, I've had a couple internships (paid, thankfully) but no real job yet. Honestly, the pressure and shame of being an intern who's still looking for a job is getting to me and I'm finding it hard to get out of bed in the morning. Do any of you have any tips for keeping up with your mental health while hunting for a job? Thanks."
How do you find the motivation to keep applying?,"Hi there, 23 year old and graduated last May. After recently moving to a new city back in with my parents I have been on the hunt for a job for the past 4 months. I have applied to maybe 50 jobs and have only recieved 2 interviews (1 Starbucks and another because my friend worked for the company) and have received only rejections. I am starting to feel a little hopeless and depressed. What can I do to drive these feelings away and keep applying? Like I said new city so I don't have any friends and I spend most of my time at home to babysit. I try and spend my free time outside exercising to escape the SADs but it is getting tough and just had a mini breakdown. Any personal experiences or advice is welcome.

Edit: Thanks everybody its hard but I will keep on pushing. And I guess look for new hobbies that don't cost money."
Failed a job interview and feel down,"Hello,

I had an interview recently at a company that pays very well. I made it to the third round but I got nervous and it affected my results on the assessments. How can I calm my nerves next time? I feel very  discouraged  losing such a good opportunity how can I move past it?"
"Accepted offer letter and got hired, but just received email they’re looking for other candidates?","I’m quite stressed at the moment because I received an email from a recent job I was hired at that they’re looking for different candidates. I’ve already did the face to face interview (not to toot my own horn, but I think I did fabulous), passed the drug test, accepted the job offer and filled out an I-9 form.

 I don’t understand why they would email me that I don’t have the job anymore after they LITERALLY hired me and had me fill out all of the paperwork. Has anybody had this experience before? 

I’m so worried that I’m sweating and can’t think straight. This is the best paying job/ career I’ve ever been offered and now it’s been ripped right out of my hands."
Can't get over being rejected for job?,"I found out a few days ago that after 3 interview rounds I came in 2nd place for a job with over 200 applicants. It was absolutely a dream job and I nailed all three interviews so really thought I had it in the bag. All my friends and family also kept saying ""oh I have a feeling you're going to get it"" as well as my husband who said these things too. 

Long story short, after researching homes to rent/buy in the amazing new city for almost every day (2.5 weeks ago) since the first great interview, looking up the route to the new office from where we want to live, and envisioning my new life with this dream job, they offered it to someone else and I came in 2nd place. Now I'm back at the job I have now and I feel completely devastated and unmotivated since I don't like this job at all and find it boring and draining. I truly thought I would get the new job and be putting in a 2 weeks notice and now...nothing. 

I thought I was over it this weekend after having a good cry but being back at my job now with no end in sight is almost unbearable. How do I get over it and stop feeling very depressed about all this? I am worried an opportunity this good will not come up for us again, as that city is the only other  place where we can both do our jobs and not have to do 2 week rotations, so opportunities are few and far in between.  Thanks in advance!"
Hurts Not Getting Chosen,"I am currently employed but am at a job where people are leaving and we aren’t hiring to fill those positions. I was was so close to landing a job that seemed perfect for me, only to get called today that they were going with another candidate after being told my interview impressed the hiring manager but there was a late interview scheduled who they ended up going with.

I feel like I am on a sinking ship watching my co-workers leave this miserable company and I am stuck with my foot being caught and can’t get out until I get laid off from our company being purchased and being in a dying industry.

Sorry just in a poor state of mind and trying to just talk to people to get it off my chest."
3+ years unemployed Digital Media major/Journalism & Professional Writing minor. Can't even find unpaid internships.,"As the title suggests, I am now entering my fourth and hopefully final year of unemployment since graduation. I currently do work a casual job at a local cinema, and have come VERY close to three different full-time job positions (lost to just one candidate in all three occasions).

On the side I create film content that has premiered at festivals and produced many contacts, but ultimately none of them have led anywhere.

After another run of about 10 rejected applications in the last batch, numerous resume updates, and otherwise complete radio silence in my job search, I'm starting to lose hope. Graduates who studied the exact same degree as myself, have left university immediately into positions, even the years behind me, and none of my other friends in my degree seemed to have the trouble I do.

Recently I even began reaching out to companies to offer myself as an intern, and those have been met with either complete silence or ""no's"", suggesting I can't even work for free.

I feel lost, stuck and increasingly useless as my very relevant and practical skills, seem to be going to complete waste and being overlooked.

How do I project myself more into employer's radars? How do I stand out?"
Can I reach out about a rejection email?,"I received a rejection email from a company today that was just from their careers system. This email didn't come from my main contact at the company. Everything for this position was going very smoothly until the coronavirus happened. The last time I reached out to my main contact was March 19. She told me that the position had been put on hold until after Covid-19. 

I feel like I would have been great in that position. I am just a lost right now. 

Please and thank you on any advice."
How do you keep from getting broken down by the job hunting process?,"I've been looking for/applying for jobs for the last year and not having much success. 

So far, out of everything, I only had two interviews. One job went to someone else, the other I'm in limbo about whether or not I made the cut to the second round of interviews. 

I'm having problems with depression and my self-worth due to being constantly rejected or ignored. I feel like I'm an attractive/qualified candidate for most of what I apply for, but obviously not if I'm struggling this much.

How do I keep myself from getting upset over this? It's hard to keep trying when nothing has worked."
Is it worth it to contact HR admin if I believe resumes are not being reviewed properly?,"
This may sound silly. I’ve been applying to internships after graduating, especially in government. One I applied for was just perfect for me. And even for a lab partner I’m friends with. I let them know about it and we both applied. There’s two spots available and I’d be happy for them if they got it. It’s the only internship in the exact stuff I worked on in college. I can check off everything. They want biology or environmental science degree current students. I have biology undergrad and working on env science grad. They want gis, I have a cert. it goes on. 

Unfortunately we both got, due to our supplemental question’s answers, we do not meet the minimum qualifications. We both think that’s weird. All of the questions were stuff like Can you lift 30 pounds? Can you work on uneven terrain? Yes. Yes yes yes. Only question one was Tell us what you know about environmental policy in the state. I love the state the internship is in and want to move there eventually. I did projects on areas in the state  on a topic in they desire. Unless I didn’t put EXACTLY what they wanted in this one question, I see no problem. 

Friend wants to send emails to the hradmin email regarding the individual who denied both based on that. I requested what was the problem as I don’t see it, without reply from the person. I don’t see any good that will come from going above them now. There’s just no way, even if we are right."
Why did a potential employer open a position after waiting to talk with me?,"What are some reasons an employer posted a position after they said they waited to speak with me first? I'm trying to figure out what happened and how I can move forward to hopefully avoid another situation like this. 

Here's the background:

Back in Nov. I applied for an open position with a nonprofit's national office. Their team is less than 10 people, but they have chapters all across the US and have a proper BoD. I moved forward with two interviews (with the executive director and the president) by January and ultimately found out that I did not get the position, but they stressed multiple times that they wanted me to keep them in mind in case any potential positions opened up. I thanked them and told them that I would definitely keep them in mind, because they're an organization that I've long wanted to be the start of my professional career. I have multiple friends and connections who have both worked and currently work there, so I felt that I knew the organization well. 

A week after I sent my thanks and notice that I'd keep them in consideration, the executive director reached out and said that a position had opened up in a different department and before they opened it up for applications, they wanted to see if I'd be interested. I immediately replied and that same day I had a fairly informal conversation over video with the exec director and the president again. The convo was essentially them describing the job and its requirements and I was even more excited because this was a position I had the most experience in and felt I would do well in. At the end of the talk, they said they'll get together and ""see if we can make you that job offer"" and would let me know. This was on February 5 and then on the 14th, after hearing nothing from them, I saw that they posted the job and were looking for applications. This past Monday I sent an email to the executive director and asked for a follow up and haven't received anything since. I'm mostly upset that they're not being communicative because they've always touted that they're the type of organization to communicate with applicants if they got the job or not, and I'm not even getting any updates or an explanation. I'm pretty confused at what to do at this point and I don't want to be pushy and send out another email next week. But if there are typical or common reasons an employer will do this, then I'd like to know so I can see if there's anything I can change when I interview at other places. I would hate to get my hopes up again and another employer does the same as that one. 

tldr; an employer wanted to see if I was interested in a position before they posted it online to accept applications and after a week of no updates, they posted the job opening online. I'd like advice or even anecdotes on similar situations and how it can be avoided."
"I'm a recent economics graduate, and can't land an entry level position anywhere. What am I doing wrong? Help with my resume please!","I recently graduated with a B.A. in economics on September 2019 from a pretty good school, and have been applying for digital marketing and analyst jobs all over Linkedin and directly on company websites. Since I wasn't able to find any success after a month of doing that, I spent my entire November learning applicable tools that a digital marketer might need (Google Analytics, HTML, etc.) and got some certifications.


I'm still not getting any replies back, and am starting to feel a little depressed from all the ghosting and rejections. I even personalize my cover letter for the companies that require them. Right now, I feel like a huge burden and a failure to my parents since it's been 3 months after I started my job hunt, with nothing to show for it. I'm not sure if it's because my resume is bad or not, so I was hoping to get some input for it to be sure.


[My resume is right here.](https://i.imgur.com/pzWnySh.png) Anyway, thank you for reading my post, and I appreciate any advice and help I can get here!"
Had 1st interview today and was told by senior recruiter she would schedule me for the 2nd round but just received automated rejection in email?,"Do you think I got rejected for the second interview or was there a mistake? I just sent the recruiter a thank you email and tried to call but got voicemail. The recruiter said she would be reaching out either Monday or Tuesday to schedule me for the second round interview.

The email is pretty standard and says that the ""leadership team"" reviewed my background and found it didn't align."
"Figured out why I don't get callbacks/interviews - violent felon with same name as me, How to mitigate?","I've been wondering why I almost never get interviews or even calls on jobs I apply for, no matter how good of a match it is. So I googled my (fairly uncommon, almost unique) name.

There were a few results for me, and a zillion for some other guy with the same name - mugshots and criminal histories (violent felonies). This is not me, and we don't look the same. Different middle initial, but that doesn't always appear, and I don't use my middle anyway.

So I imagine a potential employer googles my name, sees all those results, assumes he is me, and my resume goes right into the reject pile. Is there anything I can do to mitigate this? I suppose I could put something in my resume like ""If you google me, you'll find a ton of results for a violent felon, but that's not me."" But that's pretty unprofessional, not to mention it would make sure that in case someone forgot to, they'll be sure to google me and see all that stuff.

Anybody else ever have this problem? Any ideas? It seems that barring personal contacts or recommendations, I'm pretty much destined for automatic instant rejection for any decent legitimate job just because a convicted violent felon shares my name. Is any potential employer even going to try to figure out if that's me or not? nobody's ever asked me about it. I either get crickets or a generic rejection to any application I submit.

\[edit to add\] Also, this person has a different birthdate, so it isn't a problem during a legitimate background check, which I can and have successfully passed. But if they reject me on a simple google search, I'll never make it to a real BG check."
I didn’t get the job,"I have been applying for jobs since August last year. 

Recently I had an interview for a luxury brand. Today the manager informed me that I didn’t get the job. I did a floor trial and I actually enjoyed it and I liked the other employees too. 

I finally thought this would work. But nope.

I don’t know if it’s me but I have the skills. I’m starting to lose hope of actually getting a job and it’s starting to feel crap. 
I know people who apply and get a job straight away but with me it’s different. 
They reject my application despite all the skills I have and it just sucks."

I am a sales and distribution rep with 10 years experience.  I work in the wholesale world for stores, bakeries, restaurants, that sort of thing.  Recently, I applied for a job as a sales development specialist at a tech company.   I got to the first interview, and then a week later, I received an email saying I didn't make the cut.  I emailed back and asked why, and they said they liked everything about me, but we require candidates to have experience in strategic selling that includes working towards monthly targets and goals and developing campaigns.    


They provide on site training, and continued training through out your career, and seems like this would be something they could train, if they felt I wasn't up to par.  The reason I am posting this, is because they re-posted the job yesterday, meaning they didn't find anyone.   So, should I write an email to try and convince them to give me a shot, or would that leave a sour note?     


I have a couple of friends who work for this company, and they said they do keep your resume on file, so I don't want to annoy them, and have my name blacklisted or scratched off of future opportunities."
"Am I taking this rejection too personally, or does this seem really rude?","Hi all! 

Spent the last month job hunting as my contract was coming to an end. Have happily picked up a new gig, but found an email in my junk folder which kind of caught me off guard. 

There was a receptionist position for a local vet's office, and I thought I'd give it a go as I had experience. Their interview process was via answering machine- you'd call it, it'd give you questions, and then you had to answer all of those questions by the end of the beep. I passed that, and they sent me a text message instead of calling a week later asking for: 

1. Resume 
2. Motivation Letter (not a cover letter?) 
3. Results of a Gretchen Rubin personality quiz.
4. A list of five good points about me, and five negatives. 
5. A situation where I'd handled conflict (standard face to face interview question) 
6. My ""Life Values"" (5 minimum) 

The whole thing clocked in at more than 6 pages, and at that point I was starting to think it was a little much for a receptionist position which they kept plugging in the ad had to be a ""great superstar"" at their job. But I thought maybe they were just super busy and didnt have time to interview applicants through the usual process. In my motivation letter I explained offhandedly I'd someday love to become a vet nurse, and that I'd love to study while working there. 

Their response?   


Dear ,

Thank you for your email and attachments.Unfortunately, your resume hasn't been retained.

We are searching for a great, committed full time Receptionist and the position is NOT a stepping stone towards further animal studies. These are very different jobs.

We wish you all the very best for the future.

Thank you again for your time and efforts pertaining to your application.

Regards,  


That took six pages of my time, and I was very confused as I have had friends start out in reception and eventually moved up. It just felt incredibly cold for what I thought would show more interest in the role. Am I taking it too personally, or was that rude on their behalf? I've not really had anything other than the stock-standard rejection email before, I guess!"
How to Work for a Major Domestic/International Airline,"Hello all,

&#x200B;

Working in the aviation industry, in particular cabin crew, has been a dream of mine ever since I could remember. I think I'm definitely an outlier when I say I actually like working in customer service positions and have an innate nature for helping people. Providing exceptional customer service is very important to me and I've been recognized at my current and past positions for my ability to deliver such customer service while thinking on my feet. 

&#x200B;

I feel very stuck (and have been for years before COVID-19 hit) and honestly sad. I've applied for SO many cabin crew positions only to have them turn me down yet I see people with no experience land a cabin crew position for a major U.S. carrier. I'm only 23 years old, have my bachelors degree, have experience working in the travel industry (3rd party booking website, cringy, I know). 

&#x200B;

My question is: despite always applying, is this industry just not meant for me? I hate my current job but I'm thankful I have a job. It's call center work, and being verbally abused/dehumanized on a daily basis has made my life hell. I have no friends anymore because all I do is work. I've turned to substance abuse via prescription painkillers.  I experience anhedonia 24/7. How do I escape? I wish I could quit or something right now, but I need the money because I recently filed for bankruptcy. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; My life is a mess and I've tried applying to my dream job on multiple occasions to no success. I hate my job and it's taken a toll on my mental and physical health. What do I do?"
I cannot get a job (engineering student) and I’m starting to panic about my future.,"I’m an international student about to complete a B.S in Chemical Engineering from one of the top programs in the US. I’ve been here since early high school thanks to extended family and this place has become my home. My grades are excellent and I’ll be graduating with honors. I’ve worked where I could while studying (internship at tech company, customer service at school, 4 semesters of paid research at school and we’re getting published). Got my resume reviewed over and over again at school provided career and success events, I’ve also gone to advising in my department and career centers, gone to every career fair, applied to so many jobs and talked to so many recruiters. All I get are automated rejection emails. One after another. Week after week. I have one semester left to graduate and try to stay with OPT. Before I came to the US I lived in a place I did not fit in, with people who rejected me. My family is very traditional and I do not want to return to the confines of their life. I’ve been working so hard, but I can’t make it. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. My friends, my love, my real family is now in the US, where I struggle to anchor myself. I’m desperate and so afraid I’ll fail. Please help me if you have any insight. Thanks guys. 

I’m sorry for the lack of detail on many parts as I’m trying to preserve some anonymity."
"Rejected by McDonalds, do I still keep trying to apply to the same one?","Hey,

As of right now, I’m 17, and I applied to McDonald’s a month ago trying to get a job as a maintenance worker. I didn’t call until a few days ago. The reason why I called late was because I was so scared to call them a week later after I applied that I didn’t know what to say or what they’ll tell me. Anyways, they told me that I didn’t get the job and that I had to try again in 30 days. I was fine with that since it’s already been a month. So I applied for the same position, but got rejected the next day. I was disappointed and embarrassed that I got rejected. The cashier told me that I had a 100% of getting in. I guess he was referring to working in the kitchen since it’s so hectic there. 

Either way, I’m disappointed. I need a job since I’m going to college soon, but they don’t know that. The application never asked for my age or if I was in school. It only asked for my number, email, and time I was able to work. I live in a really quiet neighborhood, but I’m guessing the high school in front McDonald’s has students trying to work there too. 

The McDonald’s Im trying to apply to is the only closest one, it’s only a 15 minute walk. I’m sorry for this rant, but this is discouraging. I just want to know if I should keep applying, but for different positions, or not. I’m embarrassed that they probably know that I’m just desperate to try and get a job. 

Sorry for it being long. Do I apply as a crew member instead?"
What keeps you motivated?,"I quit my full time call center job back in November after 2 months of being there for two reasons. One, I was miserable and two, I had gotten offered a promotion at my old part time retail job that I hadn't officially left so I went back there and now 3 months later, that promotion is unlikely. I was originally told I would start two weeks after I had quit my full time job back in November. I'm still receiving close to 40 hours per week but I don't have benefits and the pay is abysmal. I realize I've made the mistake of staying in retail too long and now I'm paying the price. I have a bachelors in communication with a concentration in new media and communication technology that I got a year and a half ago and an associate of science degree from 2015. 

 I started applying for other full time jobs about a month ago and my question to everyone in this subreddit is how do you stay motivated after receiving rejection after rejection??"
Seven internal interviews and am burnt out.,"I work at a fortune 500 company and came in as an analyst. I felt I was ready to come in at a senior analyst level, but I thought since I was new to the industry (but not new to analytics) I would come in as an analyst and learn first before taking a leap to senior analyst. Now after a year and a quarter of experience and multiple good reviews, I started applying aggressively for a total of 6 senior analyst positions through out the company. It's a big company with many different departments so it is common for an employee to bounce around within.

Anyways, I've now done 5 interviews of which all 5 had case studies that required me to put in a full Saturday each to complete and have been rejected from 3 of them now. I have 2 more interviews scheduled and am thinking about pulling out now. There was a role that I really wanted and the hiring manager scheduled a follow up meeting with me just to reject me. That was wild. 

Does anybody have any experience with getting multiple interviews within the same company, but never landing a position? Why am I getting these interviews if they feel I'm not ready for the position?

TLDR: Applied to multiple internal, promotion positions and am getting the interviews, but not the job. Need advice on how to improve"
Should I reply to this rejection letter?,"I just received this rejection letter for my dream job:

"" Thank you for applying for the role of \*\*\*\* at \*\*\*\*. I’m sorry it has taken us so long to get back to you but we had over 700 applicants for the position and it took us some time to go through each one. We’ve interviewed a selection of applicants who looked to have the very specific experience we need at this stage and have now hired for this role. We will no doubt be looking to bring more people on board over the next few months and we’d like to keep your details on file if that’s ok with you?

We will be updating our twitter, Instagram and newsletter subscribers with other vacancies as they arise, though we can also let you know via email if you’d prefer.

We can see that you spent some time on your application, though given the large number of applicants we cannot provide feedback on each response.  (....)""

I really want to work for this company, so I'm now wondering if I should message them back to try to stand out a bit from the 700(!!!!) others if they really have other openings in the near future.

I know this is a standard response, but should I reply to this anyway? - And if so, what do I write?"

Trying to curb hopelessness,"Greetings /r/jobs, 

This is my first post here. I come to you seeking some advice. I suffer from depression, anxiety, all that... and, unfortunately for me, applying for jobs is not an exercise in positive mental health. I hate my current job; it keeps the lights on, but I am suffering from a lack of projects and severely limited potential. I just applied for one new position online, but, it just feels so hopeless. In 2019, I have received so many rejections - too numerous to mention. The self-doubt keeps creeping back no matter what I try to do. This is day 1 in what feels like an eternal struggle.

Thank you for reading my post. What else should I be doing?

Edit: I'm realizing that I'm trying to curb hopelessness assuming I will get rejected from the opportunity I applied for. This is the mindset I'm in. I would appreciate a discussion on this topic, as I am not the first person to suffer from these issues."
Applying to a place more than once. Would you do it?,"Have you/would you ever consider reapplying to a job you didn't get hired for the first time around? I've applied to a few companies/positions I've interviewed for already but didn't make the final cut, and am thinking of reapplying when the position reopens. What do you think is the likelihood you'd get the job a second time around?"
Getting rejected....but why,"So my work history is primarily with non profit and children. My roles have primarily been executive and administrative mixed with some event coordinating. 

I’m currently GA certified and I’m also working on getting certified in SQL, but I’m trying to break out of the non profit/working with children world to something with growth both professionally and financially. 

Are there some things I should be considering?"
Should I be discouraged?,I've been thinking about moving to a bigger city. How ever I feel discouraged that jobs wont hire me due to a class b theft  misdemeanor when I was 17 due to disciplinary actions by my parents. After 9 years it still comes up.

55 year-old translator looking for a job,"Hello,

My mother is a 55 year-old English/French translator working in France. I am coming here for help, because even though she has 20 years of experience in the field of translation, she also just went through her second bankruptcy - mostly because she couldn't manage the French tax system very well both times - and can't seem to find a new job to get back on her feet. 

Indeed, even though we worked together on making her a brand new CV showing her project coordination an translation skills, she has been struggling to find a job for a year now. So I have two questions about her situation:

1. What kind of job could she get as a translator with her age and experience (especially in France, but elsewhere in Europe or in any English speaking country is fine as well)?
2. How do you help someone who has lived through two bankruptcies become confident again about their professional skills?"
How many of you got the job after doing the homework?,"To all the people who had to do take home homework pre or post interview, how many times have you or someone you know actually gotten the job? Because I'm starting to think it's all a scam.

Maybe I'm just bitter, but after spending a whole Saturday re-editing a blog post and creating a content calendar for an actual month long campaign in November, I felt like my time was wasted when I got the call today that I didn't get the position, and not ""we're going with another candidate"", but ""you will not be moving forward in the process"". To add insult to injury, they didn't even respond to my email requesting feedback.

It seems these homework assignments are getting very common in my field (marketing/pr), but I find it to be very predatory, especially for recent graduates like myself who have new ideas but no experience in implementing them. The reason I think this might be what they do because in the interview she let it slip that people usually do the 1 hour post interview assignment in office, meaning they've interviewed others and still haven't filled the position, and when I asked when they were looking to fill the position she hit me with the ""whenever we find the right person, could be tomorrow, could be a month from now"".

Should I just start refusing to do these homework assignments? Because I've had my work stolen before and it really annoys me, especially since this is the organization I had my internship with. I don't mind doing the 1 hour assignment, but the homework was sketchy. Not saying that this nonprofit will steal my ideas for sure, but let's just say I set a reminder in my phone for November..."
How to overcome gap in employment,"I just can’t seem to catch a break.  

I have had steady employment since I was legally allowed to work.  I decided to have a child and of course it was just financially better for the family to stay home rather than paying for daycare.  At about year 3 my child entered preschool and I couldn’t wait to go back to work.  Finally adult interaction!  With the help of a friend, I was able to secure a position.  About a year and a half later I was forced to resign due to a family medical emergency.  I did not want to leave but there was just no way around it.  Here we are a year later and medical emergency has been well taken care of, child is in elementary school, and I REALLY NEED to work.  Problem now is my gap in employment.  I am sending out my resume (professionally revised) and applications with no return.  I am starting to feel down on myself and fear I will never find something.  Is there any advise out there on how to overcome this?  Anyone go through something similar?"
How to move on after being rejected from your dream job?,"I applied for what would basically be my dream job a couple of months ago. I had phone interview, and have been waiting to hear if I made it to the in-person round of interviews. 

I received an email today letting me know they are going forward with someone else. 

It’s just another heartbreak in a year of trying to find a job. This one just hurts more than the others since the job meant a lot and I felt I had a really good chance. 

How do I move on? How do I stop getting attached or hopeful about any position?"
Internal Interviews but Hiring Externally,"Hello!

My company is currently hiring for an entry-level position and was wondering how to handle possible results of it. It is opened to both internal and external applicants. 3 people we are interviewing are ""internal""; 1 current employee (different department) and 2 are fiances of 2 current employees. 

My question is, if neither of the 3 applicants works out, what is the best way of handling this, especially for the employee that works here. 

I want to leave this open-ended to see what you all have to say but can provide more details if it helps.

Thanks!"
Getting Accounting Gigs,"My wife has finally gotten her work permit after a pretty lengthy visa process after getting married and moving to the country about a year ago. Since December when she got her visa she has been applying to different entry level business roles in Accounting, Analyst, or even basic book keeping. She hasn’t even gotten any opportunities to interview over the phone yet. 

She started branching out to more basic office admin jobs as she would like to work soon and begin to save some money but no real luck yet. I tell her that it’s a numbers game and to keep applying but she thinks the problem may be that her degree in Accounting is from Vietnam.
I was wondering if anybody here in a hiring role or who works with any immigrants that got on with work visas have any tips for her to get hired. I don’t need the money from her working even if the income would be nice so we can take our time and be selective with roles. 

As far as her English is concerned she has enough fluency to hold conversations with people with some difficulty when it comes to nuanced language or metaphors she isn’t used to. But if people talk slow and are direct she gets it and her reading comprehension is really good so I don’t think it’s only a language issue even though that could be at play. But again she hasn’t even gotten to the phone interview part so that would be a preconceived prejudice against her."
"How to follow up on “I can’t hire you now, but want to next quarter.”","Hey guys, I’ll try to keep it short. Looking for quick advice. I was very close towards a new job back in October but was rejected after the decision came down between me and another guy. During the call, the manager (who would be my boss, not HR) explained he is looking to hire again Q1 2020, really liked me with a role in mind, and has “my resume pinned near his desk to remind him.” He seems genuine but I understand this could also be BS. 

Regardless, I wanted to follow up post-Christmas to show continued interest, reliability, and solid business  communication. I also fear as coming off too pushy. Do I send this email and more specifically, how do I phrase it? Make it a simple holiday message or focus on bringing up the job again (the positioning he is hiring in Q1 has not been posted for applications)?

Thanks for the future help!"
Has anyone ever been turned down by a company then ended up working for them down the road?,"I don't mean like a big company where you applied years later and got hired.

So I have to ask... has this ever worked out? And ESPECIALLY has it ever worked out where they reached out to you first?"
Running in circles due to lack of work experience," 

Hi everyone,

My main account is elsewhere, but I don't like this conversation to be tied to that name-specific account. Here goes nothing, in bullet points:

* I studied journalism, finished about five years ago.
* Very focused person. Usually i'd like to get on with my job, don't care about talking too much.
* Went through hell in the lower educations. Always worked hard, but was on my own a lot. Liked reading and making assignments a lot. Definitely not stupid, but courses like math and physics eluded me. Sometimes my logical mind hicks up, and it's hard to follow and draw the same conclusions everybody else does. In Dutch it's called ''omdenken'', thinking the other way around.
* Motivation came from good grades, but that suffered with higher-performing friends. This ended in a gaming and computer addiction for me, and I know basically everything there is to know about motorsports. Not liking yourself and not accomplishing dates and the usual stuff made me run into these hobbies.
* Extremely generalist with some specialist topics, since I'd like to read a lot I know heaps of info in for example (pop)science, psychology, now going more towards politics. Usually my contribution in conversations is asking questions about topic or person, and popping (fun)facts like Dr House did with Vicodin.
* Getting along with people my age is ok-ish nowadays, but before i couldn't really. only focussed on performing and my mental health suffered, thought I could out-work it. Much younger and much older people is what I click with usually.
* Since half a year getting some treatments with psychological help, and a course about vision. That is starting to kick in, which I'm happy about.
* Motivation is really hard to maintain. I don't know what to do. Trying to clear my clauset first, also with parents, they have a hard life with chronic disease and other private things. Getting things done can be a pain too, and new things usually translate to pressure for me. I have troubles relaxing into things, hanging up a bin by drilling holes can take a long time.

Why I'm posting here, and not elsewhere, is that since graduation it's been a struggle. That was five years ago, early thirties now. The problem is that only in the last year of my studies the bells started ringing, and I started performing. After that I couldn't land a job, since basically the schools flooded the market here with graduates. Then they had a better portfolio, now they are younger too. There is so much work you can do here, but usually unpaid or really poorly paid.

I tried to get some experience in volunteering and doing social media for some parties, did manual labor in the other time (but since it doesn't motivate me at all, I tried to keep that to a minimum) but every time they are interested, someone else comes along and lands the actual job. ''We have found someone who fits our profile better.'' Not sure what to do now, I have a parttime editorial job at a racing website, the first who pay me and decently. Now I am thinking about digging into SEO and marketing/communication, and also I would like to explore the world a little bit (because of culture and what I can learn from that).

How I help people is on a personal level, but at times projects faltered because of my demotivation and self image and I didn't finish them, because I let it go. Only slowly discovering that I can actually write, I'd want to help people and spread positive messages or explain things about problems to prevent or damage control for others. But the way to that point is really unclear to me. What can help me on my path? What should be my priorities? And this is an international subreddit ofc, are there differences from your countries compared to mine?

TLDR: Unsure guy, quite long after certification in journalism, can't get a job in his field since lacking work experience. What now? Vague wish to travel. Also: marketing/communication/SEO certificate?"
"How do I react on ""wrong"" feedback in a job rejection?","I recently received a rejection for a job at a company that I'd love to work. As I dropped out without getting an interview, I don't think too much about my chances to work there. Their response bothers me a bit though.

They told me the reason I dropped out was the lack of ""story telling"" in my CV. 

I appreciate the fact they even wrote a reason, but its not true. My portfolio and CV is full of projects that base on the execution and conception of stories. Its basically my top skill. 

How do I react to this mail? Should I just be quiet and say thank you or is it possible tell them what I think. I don't want to waste my chances for upcoming positions in this company, but I feel like I dropped out for the wrong reasons."
"I got a job offer I want to turn down, but I have no idea what to say","They offered 7 grand less than the lowest in the range I asked for ($45-55k), there's no health insurance even though the company focuses on health insurance affordability, my commute would be 2-3 hours a day, and I would work 50 hours a week.

 It just doesn't feel right so I want to decline... Unless it's maybe remote. I don't think this job would make me happy... They didn't even bother to call about the offer, just went straight to email. 

How do I answer??"
Recent college graduate having difficulty landing a job due to lack of experience,"I graduated college in May with a Bachelor's degree in public relations and a minor in social work (which was my first major until I switched). I changed my major to PR junior year because I realized social work just wasn't working for me. In that time I was so busy cramming classes together, working as a waitress 4-5 days a week to pay my bills, and dealing with a toxic relationship that I didn't even have time to consider an internship which is highly encouraged in college. I was taking classes consecutively that were technically supposed to be pre-requsite classes. Everyone in my classes had already or were working in a job or internship in our field and I just remember sitting in class having major anxiety having no idea what I was doing because it was all so new to me. I made all A's and did really well in my class work, but now I'm graduated with no job experience other than restaurant and retail so I feel like I'm dropping my resume for jobs and cover letters highlighting my skills within my field and it's not even being considered. It got to a point where I didn't even apply for jobs for about 3 months because I kept getting so discouraged. I've had a couple of interviews that ended in rejection and I feel like it's because I let my anxiety and self-doubt interfere in the process and wasn't able to seem confident. I've tried to make an online portfolio to showcase work I did within my classes (media advisories, press releases, campaign and event plans, etc). but I can't find a website that I find easy to maneuver because I'm low-key not very tech savvy haha. Idk, I just don't know what to do anymore and I guess I'm just looking for advice or someone going through the same issues. I know I can do the work but I feel like no one is giving me a chance. I'm becoming very depressed about it. I'm just ready to start working and stop worrying about money all the time ."
I was almost hired by a government agency. I didn't pass the suitablility but they may still be interested?,"I had a phone interview with a government agency. It went well. In a few days, I heard from their HR department that I was tentatively offered a position. I just needed a background check.

This is in a major city. I took time off work, went down to their office. I paid for parking and Uber's to get around to the different buildings to get the necessary paperwork done. I was given a tour of their office by my future supervisor and met my future co-workers.

Two days later I get a call from HR saying that I didn't pass the background check and that they are rescinding their offer. Shocked, I asked why and she said that the agency that performs their background check doesn't give details and gives them a pass/fail report. They sent me the number for someone to call so I could get more information. But their decision to rescind the offer was final.

I called the number they gave me. They told me it was because I haven't been off probation for 3 years since my DWI almost 5 years ago. In 3 months I would have passed the background check. Nowhere on the job posting did it ask about criminal history and when I filled out the preliminary employment paperwork I was honest about my DWI when they asked about probation. The paperwork did not state that this was a non-negotiable condition of employment. I felt bad that I had wasted everyone's time.

I emailed who would have been my future supervisor explaining the situation, including the DWI. I thanked him for his time and told him I hoped to apply in the future.

Almost three weeks passed. I received a response from him thanking me for sharing the details of not passing the background check. That the agency they use doesn't share their reason and just gives a pass/fail. He said that he's going to hold on to my resume in case a future position opens up. And while he can't hold the position I was applying for, he believes that I, ""would be a great fit for the team and would be willing to consider you for a future opportunity.""

I find it strange that he waited 3 weeks to respond to my email. I thought he has simply moved on. My other emails to him were responded to very quickly.

What do you all think? How should I respond, if at all?"
Received rejection letter for a job that was opened for me?,"Hello

I received a rejection letter for a job that the hiring manager and team opened up for me to fill. I was once employed there with a different department, and when I left the hiring manager of the current opening has been trying to get me back. 

I was told by an existing employee that HR is preventing the hiring manager from viewing candidates until they refine their list. When I received the rejection letter, my counterpart and reference for the job notified the director.

Can HR still interview me despite being initially “rejected”?"
When Does HR Send Rejection Letters?,"I know that not all jobs are legally required to send rejection letters and they certainly don’t send rejections to all 100+ applicants that they get for each job. But what about those that they have interviewed 3+ times? The ones that have been interviewing for quite some time? Does HR generally send them rejection letters? 

I was told last Thursday that I would hear back from a job I spent hours interviewing with in person - still nothing from them and today is technically the last day of “early week”. I thought I had a really great shot at getting the job with how well I was connected with people there, but seems they might not agree with me. Just wondering if I may get a rejection letter for some closure at the very least."
How am I supposed to improve as a candidate if no one will give feedback?,"I have been searching for full-time employment in my field of work for months. I've had several interviews, but no luck. I hear good things about my experience and that I'll be considered for other roles, but still no offers or further contact. I do ask for feedback, but often don't hear anything back.

How am I supposed to improve as I candidate? Is it my experience? Did they not like my personality? Is it something else? It's really annoying that so many places are afraid of litigation, so they're afraid to provide any sort of feedback on why a candidate isn't selected. It's frustrating not knowing on what I can do to improve, perhaps gain more work experience, learn more skills, learn how to interview better. I don't know."
asked for status yesterday. got rejection email today. is it bad to respond I'm available for temp r/o,"work while they continue search? the job has been posted for weeks and they don't seem to be in a hurry to fill it yet when I spoke with hiring managers they were expressed how desperate they were for help with scheduling/going through emails etc. my guess is that wanted someone more junior than me and more Admin focused.

so should I offer my services as a contractor or would that be pathetic and inappropriate?"
Am I being ghosted or am I just impatient?,"On January 31 a hiring manager offered to fly me out for an interview because one of the interviewers was going on vacation and they could not reschedule the interview. I accepted but I still had to dedicate a lot of time and resources as I woke up at 3:30 am (to get there for 9 am), spent $150 for the taxi’s in addition to preparing for the interview which I found out two days before was-not a traditional interview but-a power presentation on why was a great fit for the position. 

It went well and when I sent my follow up email I got a response asking if they could contact my references, which they did as one contacted me soon after.

On February 7th around 8 pm I found out I didn’t get the position but in the same email they stated that they were impressed with my profile and offered to put me in contact with another director in the company looking to hire for a similar role. In the email they asked that I follow up ASAP so, on February 8th around 12 pm I followed up by email stating that I would be thrilled to discuss the role in more detail and would like to hear any feedback they had regarding my application but I haven’t heard back from them since my last email. 

On February 10th, I noticed they removed the job listing for the position with the other director. I really don’t understand why because it was posted February 5th, less than a week.

I haven’t heard anything which is odd because prior to February 7th we exchanged 20+ emails and the hiring manager always got back to me the same day sometimes almost immediately. 

I don’t know what to do. This hiring manager knows everything about my education and experience since I have already been interviewed. I don’t have any skills left to demonstrate. However, I think a simple reply stating their intentions would be nice since I interviewed and also met the hiring manager and other staff in person.

I’ve gotten mixed feedback so far from family and friends. Some say I should wait one more week and then follow up but one of my coworkers said I should follow up on Monday. Should I follow up or should just move on?"
Rejected from dream job -_- My rejection rate is in the triple digits. How am I suppose to keep going when I am falling further into a depression? How did you find the motivation to keep going?,"Feeling exhausted and emotionally depleted. I am trying everything I can to get an offer and have made it to 3 final rounds with rejections. Applied to 300+ jobs. My bills are adding up and I've never felt like a bigger loser. I'm tired of hoping that someday some job will magically want me. This process is so freaking demoralizing. How the heck do you not give up?

Even worse my dream job replied with this: 

""Unfortunately, we have hired another candidate for the position that had more applicable experience to the role.  That being said, I do think you have a lot of awesome strengths and qualities.  I plan to keep you in mind for future opportunities and would like to reach out to you when something else comes open.  I think you would be a great fit with the \*\*\* culture and hope that we can bring you on board at some point in the future.""

\-\_- I'm doubtful I will be reached back out to "
Is it just me or is it unusually difficult to get a job?,"I am a recent university grad in the US and I majored in Political Science (I know a lot of people say that there aren't ba while lot of job opportunities in Political Science anyway blah blah blah but it still seems just as difficult for people with other degrees. Plus I feel like your degree doesn't necessarily mean you can't get a particular job considering people have jobs in fields they didn't major in all the time) but anyway, I just graduated in August and almost every day I've been sending out apps. I know I just graduated but I find it a little worrying that I haven't gotten ANYTHING yet. Nothing but getting ghosted and rejections. At first I thought it was my degree, but tbh I don't think the degree plays much of a factor here outside of just having it to show that you completed University. It just seems like it's hard for a lot of people to get jobs these days regardless of the degree especially right out of school, unless you're lucky. Is that just me? Are millennials really ruining the job market (lol)? Maybe I'm just not spending enough time plugging apps. I don't know. In any case, it's a bit depressing."
Question on getting referrals,"So I'm doing my BA degree and I really want to get into SAS for an internship(I live near their headquarters). It hasn't been going great so far(getting interviews but getting rejected afterwards). One of my professors worked with SAS for about 30 years with their leadership team. So I'm thinking of maybe asking her in an indirect way of maybe putting in a good word for me? Something like, ""Do you know whether SAS hires a lot of people from the university(the university I'm at)."" Would it be okay to do this?

Thanks for any input!"
Rejected for a job due to personality test results?,"I was elated to have an interview with a company for, what seemed to be, the perfect position. A recruiter actually found me on LinkedIn and said I would be perfect for the job and they would be silly not to hire me. I send in my resume and score an interview! The company asked before we interviewed if I would take a personality assessment. I know some large companies do this to get a sense of the person before they commit to hiring. I do the assessment, still good for the interview. I had probably one of the smoothest interviews ever! I was so confident this was going to work out. The interviewer was thrilled with my experience and excited for me to join the team. I even sent a follow-up thank you email.

A couple days go by and I finally hear from my recruiter: It was a no! I was stunned! My recruiter said the person who interviewed me loved me, she fought for me to be accepted. But, apparently, the owner of the company is basing hires on these personality tests, and I just didn't fit the mold!?

I have had some time to think and reflect: it's like it wasn't me, but, it was me? Idk, I am still confused.. If. Company was basing hiring on those tests- why conduct interviews of those who don't ""make the cut""?

Has anyone had this happen? Are you familiar with these tests?

The ones they used were from PI- my result was a collaborator. The job I was interviewing for was project management. Literally, the same job I was doing at my last job- just a different company.

The recruiter also stated they wouldn't tell her what parameters they are really looking for..."
Should I leave my degree off applications and resume when applying to minimum wage jobs?,"I have a BA in biology- job search is not going well so I’m think about taking a certification class to enhance my resume and skills.

In the meantime, I’m trying to get a third shift job so I can go to class in the day but still make some money at night. I currently work fast food but hate it and need to leave.

I was thinking about trying to get a job at a gas station or convenience store on overnight shifts. Should I take my BA degree off my resume and applications? I’ve heard that when places think you’re “overqualified” they’ll be less likely to hire you."
Employer cancelled hiring process,"Hi all. In a bit of a pickle here. I recently applied and was interviewed for a position. References were called and the day when I was informed a decision was to be made, I was told the employer decided to end the search and repost the job, and was told that I should feel free to apply again. I've never come across this situation before, so I wanted to hear from fellow job-seekers what the proper etiquette is. Is it worth reapplying? Do I send in the exact same materials I sent in the first time? TIA!"
Rejection or Awaiting Decision?,"

I’m a high-student seeking part-time for the first time ever, please bear with me if I say something amateur-ish. 

After talking to the hiring manager for fifteen minutes and “really connecting”, I decided to apply for a position at my local ice rink. The general window for applications was a span of one month, but I applied pretty early. It’s been 3.5 weeks and the application window closed a week ago. I haven’t gotten a response and tried to get in contact with him in person, then in email. It’s been 1.5 weeks, I still don’t have a reply. I asked a bunch of people who worked there and somebody said “You should a response in a week...” and somebody else said “Yeah he does that, I had to contact him a lot to get this job”.

Did I get rejected? Is it possible that they’re reviewing applications after the application window closes? I only really want to apply here since it pays well and I’ll enjoy it, but I’m just so anxious. I know I’d only know what’s going on once I can actually get in contact with the hiring manager, but maybe I can get a little insight from Reddit while I’m waiting. 

All help appreciated, thanks."
Asked for an interview only to get a rejection letter?,"So the time line was basically that I missed their first email (went to spam) so I asked if I could get another time slot and they didn't get back to me until 7 days later. They apologized for it and asked me to fill available times for this week. I did that and sent follow up emails and they just never responded. And this morning I get a ""we regret to inform you"" email. Has this ever happened to anyone else?"
"I added my photo my cover letter, did I mess up?","I used one of the templates from word and added my photo. It’s me in a suit dressed professionally. I applied for a job yesterday, would my application be rejected because I added a photo to my CV?"
Not being kept after seasonal,"So, I worked a job for over three months on contract. They hired twenty six seasonals and the two people who got hired on the same time as me got their contracts extended, but I did not and I can't help but not take it personally. I am truly appreciative for the opportunity I was given but I feel like I was snuffed out of getting to become a permanent. In my past I have had conflicts with other coworkers because our personalities clashed. Most of the time I was told I was not a good fit and I had to go. I keep having horrible flashbacks of those times and am taking this really personal. Over these three months, I have worked well with a majority of the people. There were a few who just don't like me, and thats fine, but I don't see why that should stop me from working there. There are over two hundred employees!!! I brought good numbers and sales, was very professional, and got great reviews. I am trying to move on, but afraid this will happen to me wherever I go."
Email to a recruiter,"Hi, 

I interviewed extensively for a job then got rejected on the final round. I got the automated rejection email first, then a recruiter emailed yesterday saying she was sorry and that I did really well but they overestimated their spots to candidates and therefore did not have space. She said there might be more spots in a few months and she will let me know. 

&#x200B;

I want to send her a reply saying I was bummed out for the rejection but being positive about the interviewing experience and the company in general. I also want to state specifically what I am interested in and say to keep in touch with updates. 

&#x200B;

Please help me craft the email if you can. 

Thanks"
"I left a stable, stagnant job a year ago for career growth, then got let go from that position after 8 months. Now I fear I will never work in my field again. RANT","As the title said I had a stable job in as a pharmaceutical manufacturing engineer at a smaller pharmaceutical company in MA for 4.5 years. The pay was below market rate and not much opportunity for growth, but had great job security. However, I got antzy and wanted better career growth. I found a role that promised that with a $20k pay increase, so I left my comfortable but stagnant role and took a chance with a new role.

This new role did not work out. The role was different than advertised and I could not adjust well to it. I was let go in June. I wasn't really distraught over it, because I felt I could pick myself up quickly. Plus the job market was ""hot"" according to recruiters.

I have not been able to find an equivalent job since. I have had multiple interviews with companies large and small. However, none have yielded a suitable offer. Now I'm approaching 6 months of unemployment and I fear I am being shut out of the job market because I made one mistake one year ago to leave a comfortable job to ""find my market value"".

Sometimes I miss working in retail where you don't have to deal with ""cultural fit"" bullshit and recruiting agencies who just farm you for contacts and throw you to the curb and tell you your experience is worthless."
What is the weirdest or most BS explanation you've been given for not getting a job?,"I just got a rejection email after an interview stating that the primary reason they didn't offer was because they wanted a local candidate. I live 2 blocks away from their office, my home is closer to their office than their company parking lot is. 

This is probably the only time I would've actually preferred a vague rejection from a do-not-reply account. I'm not even upset, just confused about whether they got me mixed up with a different candidate, or just wrote the first excuse they could think of."
How do you keep going,"I lost my job when my country's automotive sector tanked. That was January, after about 84 interviews and thousands of resumes sent out I'm running out of steam and becoming bitter. Anyone out there gone through similar and if so how did you keep going."
How do you get past the job app screenings?!,"A bit of a rant mix with a question.

I've been working on a job application for a finance position that required ""Some College"" experience at a university.  I'm a current grad student (4.0 GPA) there and this particular position was inside my school so I was pretty excited for the opportunity and put a few hours and had several consultations with our career planning department before I submitted an official application.  I finish the process Saturday morning and at 8:30 Monday morning I got a general rejection letter.  I'm assuming that no one stayed over the weekend to go through applications so I know it has to do with the screening process.

I included a large chunk of their job description descriptors and included my past 5-6 years of experience in the finance department at my current job.  I was told to include that I was a current grad student because they love hiring students but after all of this I still couldn't get past the screening.  I'm somewhat devastated.  I couldn't pass a simple computer screening even with all of this consultations and hours of work in perfecting my resume and cover letter.

How do you get a foot in the door?  I just don't understand the formula to beat the screening and have an actual set of human eyes go over my resume."
Is it wrong to not respond to a rejection email?,"I recently applied for a position and completed rounds of interviews for the position. I received an email from a recruiter with the company stating that I was not selected for the position.  Most rejections that I've received from companies were automated responses and weren't attached to a direct person, always signed ""Company A HR"". In this case, I interviewed with the recruiter and the same recruiter stuck with me throughout the entire process. FWIW, the email had the common speech given when rejecting a candidate, but it was signed by the recruiter. I'm really not sure if I should reply to the email. I honestly don't see a point in responding since my time with them is done, but I don't want to seem like an entitled brat for ghosting them after a rejection. I also don't see myself applying to the company in the future, if that has anything to do with it. What should I do?"
Really beginning to feel scared today. Yet another rejection for a position I’m more than qualified for.,"I am a very qualified candidate with a clean record, performed highly in my last role, and look good on paper for the jobs I’m applying for. Today marks three months since I quit a job that was destroying me inside. In this time, I’ve applied to at least like 50-75 jobs, resulting in 7 final round interviews. Ive left most of them feeling like it went well. The answers I gave during these interviews were for the most part clear concise and applicable, following the STAR format to a tee. I’m confident of that because of how few probing questions my answers seem to provoke. This morning I opened my email to see that, yet again, I have not been selected to fill the role I most recently interviewed for. I genuinely do not know why I’m not getting offers. Based on past experience, I know the difference between when an interview went well and when it went poorly. But now, I am just so confused about what I’m not providing. For the first time today, I’m really feeling scared that I won’t get a job with the salary and benefits I need.

Edit: Also, I wanted to run this past anyone who reads this post. Obviously, when you quit a job it’s going to be the elephant in the room when you begin interviewing for a new one. When asked why I left my old company, I reply with a brief history of my time spent there that basically culminates with “My ambition was to learn a new part of the business after performing well in the same department/same role for 2.5 years. However, it became apparent this was not going to happen in a manner that aligned with my own personal and professional goals, and I did not believe I was going to make much more progress in my current role. Therefore, I decided to explore opportunities outside of the company.” This is an honest accurate answer, but I have suspicion that it is not being received well. Does anyone have any feedback on this?

Edit: This is an unbelievably supportive sub! I am first time poster, but your well measured advice and encouragement has completely snapped me out of my pity party today. Thank you so much everyone."
How to keep going after so many rejection letters?,"Sorry if this seems rambly, ranty and stream of conscious, but I just need to get this off my chest.

Since the end of February I have had 10 job interviews, however each time I keep getting the standard:

*""It is clear that you have some fantastic skills and experience. Unfortunately, at this stage, we will not be proceeding with your application as there were candidates that more closely matched what we are looking for at this particular time.""*

I am young and enthusiastic and willing to get my hands dirty to get the job done right, I can think on my feet and work well on my own or with others.

I honestly wish I knew what I was doing wrong. What are they looking for? Is it experience? I have that in droves. I've done classes, I've done work experience and I've done unpaid work. Is it confidence? I admit new situations throw me for a loop but I bounce back pretty quickly.

I am at a loss and just seeing the same things in my inbox over and over and over again is really making me question myself as not only an adult but as an individual.

Thank you for reading.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow, I go to bed and come back with over 30 inbox messages, thank you, everyone! I have read all of your advice it's so helpful and uplifting, I can't thank you all enough, I'd bake you all a cake if I could. I wish all of you luck in your own job searching. :) :D"
Turned down because of too high salary expectation. No discussion to be had at all. Is this normal?,"So a potential employer had strung me along for months. They seemed interested in my application but were very sparse shall we say with their communication. They would respond in 2-3 week intervals and always no more than two sentences and there was talk of an interview at some point which never came to light. So yeah not good signs obviously. Finally they ask what my salary expectations are and I respond with what I thought was a very reasonable amount. A week later they respond and quite bluntly turn me down because my salary expectation was too high. This was for a company in a far away country so the standards might be different - fair enough. I expressed that I did not know what the salary standards are over there and what amount they would be comfortable with then. They do not seem to want to talk about it whatsoever.

I am really irked by this because I find it such a trivial reason (and not a smart business practice) to turn someone down. Now mind you If they had said we're willing you pay you this much instead and I had then tried to negotiate further then sure I would understand it. But to not even hear what the expectations were on their side I find just unfair.

Admittedly I partially write this here as a means to vent but also I would like to know if this is normal practice within the hiring process and perhaps what is, if there is one, the deeper reasoning for it?"
Career Change,"I've been alifestyle journalist for over 10 years, I managed English-language magazines, websites etc. That is untill I relocated from Thailand to the UK six month ago. I haven't been able to find employment since. 

At first I aimed for marketing and communications jobs, but after months of rejections, I'm very much in doubt over what to do next. I actually ended up riding a bicycle for uber eats just to get out of the house and earn a little money. An while no work is shameful, I still feel sort of embarrassed working as a delivery guy, considering my previous jobs and experience. 

My question would be, has anyone here undergone a  career change? Can you share your stories? I'm 38 and the idea of starting at the very bottom again is not appealing at all... Looking for inspiration and a morale boost."
Advice on Recovering from 2 Years of Underemployment,"Hello everyone,

I have a Bachelor's in Environmental Science and Master's in Climate Science and Solutions. I graduated in December 2017. Since then, I've had two internships in the environmental field since August 2018. An internship with the local government until just a week ago, and an internship with a private company that started this Monday. I've applied to hundreds of jobs in my city in Southern California.  Due to my wife's career, I've only been able to apply for jobs here. My internship hosts in the local government wanted to hire me but were unable to. I've gone to networking events, taken extra classes, and cold called several companies in addition to applications. Can anyone please offer advice? I need serious help and I'm worried it might already be too late to get a full time job. My current internship ends in July and I might have to go back to retail if I don't get something before then."
"I keep getting invited and have a positive interview, then I'm rejected for having too little experience","I just had an interview yesterday that seemed to go really well. I had an answer to all questions and they actually didn't really ask me much technical stuff. It went for 90 minutes and towards the end they kinda acted like it was already fact that I'd be starting soon.

Today I get the rejection for being 'too junior' (Junior software dev) and having too little experience. I mean my experience is right there in my CV. Did they think I'd suddenly pull something new from my sleeve?

This has happened several times, I get interviews or at least a first phone interview and people keep mentioning how positive their impression is, how pleasant the talk was etc but then the rejection comes for not having enough experience. Can they truly not figure that out before inviting me? Or do you think they are really using it as an excuse? I am a junior dev applying to junior dev offers so idk what they expect."
How to not take rejections personally?,"I get it, it takes over 100 resumes and applications to even come close to getting a job these days. But how do you not take it personally when you make it all the way to the final round of interviews for 4-5 jobs and every single time you get rejected. I don’t care about the companies I never hear from or who I’ve never spoken to, it’s the companies who I’ve met with in person and had multiple hour long conversations with who ultimately reject and then ghost me that are starting to sting. I’ve asked for feedback of every single final interview rejection that I’ve gotten and then I never hear from those companies again. How do you stop feeling like it’s your fault and you’re doing something wrong?"
Rejection due to lack of experience,"I’ve just been rejected from my dream job after making it to the second round of interviews. I received really positive feedback where they told me I should be proud of my conduct in the interview, I answered the questions well and asked excellent questions, but they would be going for someone with more experience. This is disappointing as the job did not specify experience and they knew from the start that I didn’t have any experience. It’s a really competitive industry and it’s so hard to get the experience, I thought this would be my chance to get some experience! 

Any guidance or reassurance would be grateful!

Edit: I’ve asked the company if they do internships or have any other opportunities for me to gain experience."
Sick of job searching,"I have been unemployed for the last 3 months after being made redundant from my last job, which I was at for about 18 months. I was also made redundant from my job before that and was unemployed for 7 months.

I have been interviewing for the last few months and have received countless rejections for jobs I am definitely qualified to do. Even some jobs that I was overqualified for.

I recently contacted a recruiter who put me up for a position I thought I was perfect for. I spent all last week going in for 3 interviews and completing a personality test to see if I fit in with the company culture (I passed this test). I’m supposed to hear back from the recruiter sometime today, but in my daily job searching I just saw that the position was readvertised this morning. So it looks like I’m not getting the job, even after 3 promising interviews.

I think I’ve reached my limit with job searching. Fortunately I have savings, so I’m okay financially. But mentally I’m just so bored and feeling drained. All I want is for someone to take a chance on me and let me get into a role and show them what I can do.

It seems that being a hard worker isn’t enough these days. The recruitment process seems to be just a series of mind games, with employers having unrealistic expectations of job candidates.

I’m really not sure where to go from here? I feel like I need to do something different, because what I’m doing right now isn’t working."
Curious about a recruiter's response,"Hi, so I applied for a job and honestly I just did it because 'why not?' I think I would love working for this company but I wouldn't think they would hire me since I don't have much experience yet.

The thing is mainly just curiousity since I just want to know what should I think of their response, they said this to me in an email:

>'Dear (my  name),  
>  
>Thank you very much for your application and interest in working with  us here at (company name). While our team appreciated your application for the position of (position) and has  reviewed it carefully, we have decided to move forward with another candidate at this time.  
>  
>While we didn’t select your application this time, we are very  interested by your profile and may reach out to you regarding future opportunities.    
>  
>In the meantime, please visit regularly the Careers website for new postings and to keep your profile up to date. Also, you could consider following our new career Twitter account for the latest openings.   
>  
>Thanks again for your time and your interest in us,

>The Recruitment Team'

&#x200B;

I honestly don't mind and understand their decision, I will keep working hard to try to improve, I'm just curious to know the opinion of people who know more about this, when the recruitment says this kind of things, do they mean what they said in this email and are truly interested in the profile or it's just sugar-coating a 'We don't truly want you'."
How do you stay motivated to continue to search?,I’ve been searching for a better job for the better part of two years now and I’m so burnt out on rejection. Any suggestions for staving away suicidal thoughts as a result?
"Expecting an offer... ""we've chosen another candidate"". I'm so confused.","I interviewed for a company on Tuesday and it went really well to the point that they were trying to sell me the company/position. I didn't really have to work that hard in talking about myself.

That evening I got a phone call asking me to come back for an ""informal interview"" the following day. I drove 2 hours to get to this interview. Again, everything went well to the point that they told me about the other candidates, said me I'd fit in well, and ""give me a day to put an offer together"".

I receive an email saying I'd hear back from them early next week as the timeline was originally by the end of the week.

Today I got an email thanking me for my time but they have decided to go with another candidate.

I'm so confused and pissed. I was expecting an offer and delayed another company because of this. Should I ask what happened? Or just ignore it. My instinct is to ignore it as it won't change anything, but I also want to find out what the hell went wrong."
I'm pretty sure I should just give up finding a job in chemistry,"&#x200B;

I've graduated with a Bsc in chemistry, couldn't find a job in chemistry until I pretty much got pity hired out of a receptionist job to be a self employed consultant to an engineering firm, since then I've moved out of the UK to Holland for personal reasons but still have small bits of work to do with them for cash whilst I'm looking for new work, but it is barely liveable wages.

My main issues just come with getting experience. Last job interview I got the feeling that my experience working with instruments at university was null and void because it wasn't paid work. Paid work without experience seems impossible to come by and I can hardly purchase or get my hands on any of the instrumentation personally. Ever job offering has different instrumentation they want experience with.

This is the only topic I enjoy learning things about that I could use as a career, but it just feels like playing a shitty lottery. I get turned down for work that is simple I'm over qualified for, and because I don't have a phd the other half of job postings seem unattainable with my experience.

Feels like I should just cut my loses and go become a chef or something."
HR called me to interview me for a job they didn't know I already interviewed for then the next day I was told I didn't get the job.,"So I interviewed at a company which I know went extremely well. The interviewer told me that he loved me but the only thing is that somebody from within the company is applying for my position and he might get priority. Aside from that, he said he will try to get me to come in to replace the spot of the employee from within the company. I was told I'd hear back in a few weeks and I really felt confident in hearing some good news. Fast forward a few weeks and I get a call from the company. The HR recruiter told me she'd like to bring me in for an interview and I awkwardly told her that I already interviewed for the job she's calling me about. She felt really embarrassed and just said ""really? I'm sorry who did you interview with?"" I told her who and she told me she will talk to him and get back to me. I'm sitting here thinking okay this isn't very organized but I must have a good shot if two different people called me to interview. 

A few days later I got an email saying that under really careful consideration, I did not get the job. 

Wtf?"
I keep getting rejected from jobs and I have no idea why.,"I've been stuck being underemployed for a while now. I keep applying to jobs and I keep failing to get them. I've had interviews who always just ghost on me. I try to reach out to see how to improve and they never respond or promise to call me right back. One of them I have no idea why I wouldn't of gotten as I thought my experience, interview, and interactions with staff were perfect. I've tried the go getter approach for interviews, which people seem either annoyed or befuddled with, and I have tried the passive which of course results in nothing. It feels like everything I do is a failure and it's really putting me in a bad place. I can't even get a basic customer service job, so I am stuck with my part time gig.

 It is especially hard when I hear comments from other people. People who know me I don't think believe I am trying hard enough because of my background. It's also been difficult because a few jobs have said they are looking for a more diverse candidate, which I understand for some positions but is such punch in the gut. At this point the only thing available for me seems to be working as a field organizer in the upcoming elections, which is the last thing I want to do. It's just long hours with little pay and little to no career advancement. I am the biggest failure right now, being unable to get a career started. I want to think things are getting better, but I am well aware they are not and am ready to throw in the towel. Thanks for listening I just needed to type this out after the most recent rejection, appreciate it and good luck all."
Interview got cancelled because the job was filled.,"I need to vent. I have been looking for jobs in the area I’m planning on moving to for a few months now and it really hasn’t panned out at all. I keep getting ghosted or rejected by potential employers and it’s pushing back mine and my SO’s moving timeline. I finally scored an interview (or so I thought) but I didn’t get a call at the scheduled time. I waited half an hour, was just about to email the person back to reschedule when I saw they sent me a generic “Thank you for your time” email letting me know the position got filled. I’m beyond frustrated and distraught with this round of job searching, no one values your time whatsoever. I was always prompt with my email responses, while they sometimes took over two days to respond causing me to miss en earlier interview window where MAYBE I would have had a chance to present myself. 

I might edit this post later, but I’m not sure what else to add. Thanks for reading."
Getting rejected for my first job,"So i found a job opening for a copy shop near me on some job site, they pay well and they dont require work experience. This was amazing for me because i filled everything they wanted, im 19 and a student with no work experience, they are also open to employing students. I've sent my CV(which isnt very indepth by the way because there isnt much to write about) 5 days ago and i still havent heard of them. The deadline on the site ends in 3 days, should i go to the actual store and ask around or should i keep searching? I've been searching for weeks and this is one of the few jobs that seem decent."
Not being hired because I'm unemployed,"I interviewed for a job on Thursday.  I've been unemployed since August, and have been holding out for a role that I'm interested in and is aligned with my career aspirations and goals. I have a great resume, references from my previous employer, and a work sample that proves I am capable of building complex financial models. I offered all of these documents to the hiring manager and the recruiter emailed me Thursday evening saying the hiring manager really liked me and that they will let me know about next steps.

&#x200B;

Today, the recruiter got back to me and said the company was not moving forward with me because the CFO can't get over the fact that I am unemployed.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have recommendations of how I can try and get around this or a similar story? Offer to work unpaid for a month or two to prove myself? Get a temp job and keep in contact with the company to see if they would reconsider once my temp job ends so I would have another reference?

&#x200B;

Anything would help, thanks."
Why is it everyone is so much more qualified than me?,"First: A disclaimer. I have Aspergers so I am not human, and that has caused me a lot of trouble in the job search.

Main post: Why is everyone so qualified? I see postings for Environmental Scientist and similar jobs that are entry-level and require 3-5 years of experience. How did you humans become so qualified? I'm aware that almost everyone applying to these jobs has that experience by graduation from college. How? How did you do it? I'm disgusted that I don't have the qualifications you humans have but I want to learn how to act like one of you so I have a small chance of getting a job. For reference, 85% of my type of vermin are unemployed, so it's clearly our fault. I just want to know how you do it. How do you humans become so qualified so quickly? How do almost all of you humans have jobs? Why can't I be like you?"
"I’ve been volunteering with the same non-profit for 3 years, when I finally apply for a paid position I’m rejected. Do I keep volunteering?","I’ve been helping out at a non-profit in my community since 2016. It’s primarily a women’s shelter but they also offer other services to the community including a girls day camp in the summer. I have helped sort and organize clothing donations, hosted an art club for residents, helped set up their annual Women’s Award Luncheon, and even helped residents with the job search. 

Last summer I also volunteered at the girls day camp. I had a lot of fun and the two women supervising me said I was an incredible help. So this year when the camp coach position opened up I jumped at it.

I interviewed with the hiring executive for the camp and I thought it went quite well. Today I received an email saying essentially this:

“Thank you for all you’ve done for the organization. Thank you for your interest in the paid position. When are you available to volunteer again?”

Now I’m starting to question if I should keep doing free work for the organization I love and believe in when I really need a paid position and I’d like to join their ranks as an actual employee.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for their feedback. This afternoon I contacted the camp directors requesting feedback on my resume and interview. Camp starts next week...we’ll see what they say. If they never respond I’ve decided I’ll only lead three yoga classes because I already offered to do this but no more daily volunteering.

FINAL UPDATE: I received a form denial letter via email after inquiring about improvements I could make in order to occupy the role in the future."
Is it wrong to apply to a part-time movie theater job again after not hearing back from the initial interview? I have met two managers there and I thought I left a relatively good impression on each.,"I am aware of a few mistakes I made during the interview. I really need to get my first proper job soon since university is only nine months away and it would be quite beneficial to have some experience and reference prior to moving away for a bit of work security. I thought I gave rather academic answers for some of the interview questions, but in the end you never know if another candidate knew one of the managers. Now that you know my story, is it wrong to apply a second time if another position comes up soon?"
Dealing with rejection after an interview that I thought went really well.,"As the post title suggests, I just got rejected from a job that I both *really* wanted, and *really* thought I had in the bag. I've been refreshing my email incessantly since my interview on Monday, after genuinely feeling like I had put on my best performance in an interview ever. I felt like I connected very strongly with the recruiter, was able to demonstrate every aspect of my personality/experience that I hoped to, and I even received positive feedback from her at the end that she was ""really impressed by my capability to learn new things.""

Dealing with this rejection is harder than the rest, because it makes me question whether or not I'm good enough. When I've done my *absolute* best and **still** come up short, am I really a good, qualified candidate at all? 

It's been eating me up since I got that phone call, and I really need some advice on how to move forward, what may have contributed to the decision that was made against me, and how to focus on improving."
2 months and 3 interviews later and I get turned down for a job offer.,"Small private company in oil and gas, first I had a phone interview, was then flown out by them to Houston for a face to face, and finally a video conference interview.  10 days after the video interview (today) I was notified that unfortunately they were going to continue their search.  

The thing that really burns my ass is that I had called and spoke to their hr person yesterday and she voluntarily told me how much everyone had liked me in my final interview, “no one had anything bad to say and enjoyed how personable you were.”  Needless to say finding out today that I was turned down for the position really caught me off guard, especially after such positive reinforcement from one of the employees that was involved in the final interview. 

Guess it just goes to show you it doesn’t matter how much the position seems “in the bag” you never truly know until you get the offer letter.  Anyone else ever gone through something similar?  Guess it’s time to dust myself off and try to find another opportunity, job hunting shouldn’t be this difficult."
Job-Seeking friend faking Bachelors Degree & Unofficial shortened name,"Hi all,
We have a friend interviewing with startups and well funded companies all around US that has the background and experience to do well and this is generally the idea they get when talking with recruiters and interviewers. This is for sales executive jobs btw so we all agree they have references to previous employers that gladly recommend them for sales roles. This is someone who has done a few million $ in sales at minimum over a decade plus.
Speaking with this friend, if they said they have a Bachelors in Business, no one would question it because they can back it up with their knowledge and experience. Here’s two facts that is always a point of discussion why they can’t land a job with this recent run:
-They didn’t actually finish college but dropped out just a couple semesters shy, but their resume will state they have a Bachelors in the school. I’ll note they do have an Associates. It’s now almost a decade since they dropped out and continuing their degree would mean starting from scratch.
-Imagine their real name was Penelope Goldsmith, due to their name always being a topic and being misspelled they unofficially shortened their name throughout all social and professional sites and resumes to Pene Gold (just a random example!) In this case, thousands of people only know them as Pene Gold and only close friends/family know their full name.

So our friend group has a rising suspicion that their interviews are going really well, most go to final steps, but they hit a wall so we’re curious if HR people could chime in:
-In this case you only know Pene Gold, would you be doing research on Pene Gold? Clearly the name brings up official social media’s, LinkedIn with heavy references and all that so the person is real but do you run a background name check and see it’s not a real name and cut the process there?
-Would you be running their name in some sort of college database? Obviously their name is not real and even if you get their real name, I guess in this case it pop up with nothing or that they only have an associates?

We’ve been clashing heads on this discussion for years now and we want to ultimately know:
-Should they go back to using their real name? Pene Gold has no govt/papertrail besides what’s been built online.
-Should they ultimately just remove the college degree from their resume and LinkedIn? Or should they keep the Associates? 

TL;DR:
-Friend unofficially shortened name years back on LinkedIn and social media so now everyone knows them as that unofficially shortened name
-Friend puts they have a Bachelors but in reality dropped out two semesters early and only have an associates. Obviously tied to their real name which no one publicly knows.
-Friend is getting to final stage interviews for $100k+ Sales Exec jobs around US with a lot of interest but they all keep dropping off magically.

We all really appreciate any input especially from HR and Founders that hire for these sort of roles."
What’s with that other candidate? (Rant inside),"TLDR: how come they always pick the other candidate who isn’t necessarily better? Why am I never that other candidate? I either get rejected right away because I suck or am underqualified or I don’t suck but they pick the other underqualified candidate. 

I’ve been working for a huge telecom company for the past 5 years as a contractor and I have great relations with a lot of people who I work with. I even know the HR guys because I interviewed thrice for three different positions since June. So I just got my third rejection call. 

Nobody, not even once, told me I wasn’t qualified for the job I was interviewing for. Nobody told me I sucked at the interview or didn’t answer the questions well or didn’t ask smart questions. Not even because of my salary expectations. Even all my references who actually work there gave amazing feedback and recommended me. 

It has been a very tough decision to make but unfortunately after 3 long days and too much head scratching, the hiring manager decided to go with the other candidate who isn’t as good as you. I mean are you kidding me?!!! 

This time the dude went on and told me that there has been a lot of discussions and the people don’t want a great talent (me) to slip away and in the next 1 to 2 weeks they will create a vacancy just for me to put me in it. Like why don’t you just put me in one of the vacancies that you already have?! 

Sorry for the rant but honestly I was shocked and my legs couldn’t carry me that I had to rush to the nearest chair when the dude told the other candidate was picked. 

Should I expect them to open a vacancy for me or was this just some cheap consolation bs?"
Put in my notice for a company I have been with for 11 years because I found a new job. My current company is trying to keep me by offering me more money.,"I told my current company what I would want to make in order to remain where I am. After a few days they came back with a number that was a good bit under my asking. Therefore I have decided to remain on track for resigning.

Young male looking for help with following-up and finding mental stability,"I’m 17, my parents split when I was young and I recently had to move away from my moms due to lack on money and other personal issues. I’ve been at a very low point for a long time and I really need a full time job that works with school so I can save for my future. I had an interview at a place that was full time 5-11pm and I went for the interview and wasn’t interviewed by the owner, but his under who said he was away.

6 months of applying and almost zero interviews,"I got laid off from corporate job. My side hustle actually became a success (though not enough to live off of completely) and taught me many additional sills and gave me all the experience that comes from growing a business. I think I'm pretty good at showing how both my corporate and entrepreneurial experience would make me a good fit, but I'm getting NO love, whatsoever. Am I applying almost exclusively to remote positions. Mostly junior-level and part-time. Is that the problem? Am I overqualified for the jobs I'm applying for?"
What am I doing wrong?,"I need advice badly as I feel so defeated right now. I have 14 years of automotive experience. From dealer level to on site OEM support. I have Customer support and sales experience. I dealt with high profile Customers and cases in the past as an escalations manager in a well known American automakers Customer Relations Center. For the past 9 years I have been assisting their dealer network in all markets globally with parts catalog related queries and also have a lot of training experience under my belt.

In spite of all this knowledge it would appear I am completely and utterly unemployable. And its getting to the point where Just ending it all seems like a good option. I apply for parts sales jobs and then get told they will be pursuing candidates who's skill set more closely matches the job spec???? I'm literally the guy your parts guy calls when they cant identify a part! How am I not the perfect candidate? I have applied for parts manager jobs, I have applied for the same job I am doing now but at other OEMS. No takers...

Everywhere I apply I get blocked, what am i doing wrong???? I cant find another job, I cant move up and I have been in the same job for the Last 9 years and I am so hungry for a new challenge, but it appears i am completely unemployable..."
"After months of searching, I found my dream job. 17 days later I was let go.","I’m so gutted. I was let go because I was “trying to change everything”. I don’t understand, they listed off all these tasks that needed revamping, and my boss told me she wanted me to get her approval every time. So I would write up drafts of new letters to show her, and she told me she heard things from others (wouldn’t tell me what) and that I was changing too much. For the first time in my life I found a job I really loved and somehow I flushed it. Sorry, just need to get it out. Back to the unemployment board."
Didn't get the job after two rounds of interviews. Thought they went well. Any advice?,"After interviewing for a position I was really excited about last week, I got the news today that I wasn’t selected to move forward. Disappointed, I have spent most of the day trying to figure out what went wrong, if anything, and how I can improve myself as a candidate going forward.

The position was an entry-to-mid level technical support position at a SaaS start-up. This matched my experience really well.

I worked at a voice communication SaaS company for five years. It was very much still a “start-up” when I got hired. Me and three others were the first in-house hires on the customer support/technical support team. I spend three years in customer support, then a year as a Tier 2 Technical Support Specialist. I left for three months in 2017 for personal reasons, but was then hired on again as a Lead Customer Service Rep. I left again in May 2018 because I would be moving out of the state over the summer.

Since May 2018 I have been driving for Uber full-time. I know this huge gap in my employment may not look good, but I try to play it off. I tell them my experience as an Uber driver helped me build my time management and customer service skills, and that it was essentially running my own business.

Because the team is mostly remote (I'd work at their actual office nearby though), all my interviews were over Google Hangouts. My first interview was with the Tier 1 Tech Lead, which went well enough for me to get invited for a second round interview. The second interview was last Friday. 

The second interview lasted for about 2-hours, again over Google Hangouts. I spoke with three separate people. The first was the Tier 2 Tech Lead, and I thought it went really well. He mentioned he thought my experience was a great fit, and liked that I expressed interest in growing within the company (specifically on the QA/product development team). 

I spent a lot of time preparing, and made a trial account of the service in order to get more familiar with it. He really liked that I did that, and mentioned most candidates don’t spend the time to do so.

The second was the Sr. Director of Technical Support. He seemed a bit reserved and that interview lasted shorter, but I think that may have just been his personality. It was half him asking me questions, and half me interviewing him. I came prepared with a list of questions. He mentioned my questions were really good.

The third and final was with the Tier I Lead again. That was extremely short because she had essentially interviewed me already, and she said she “already grilled me with enough tough questions”. 

She told me to expect to hear back by this Friday. 

Their technical support team up to now has been contracted out through Upstart, but they are hiring in-house now. 

One of their contracted agents lives in Florida. The hiring manager said they can’t hire in Florida for some weird reason, so they were waiting to hear if the person was going to relocate in order to keep the job. Then they’d know if they have a position to fill (they had two open, but one was filled during my interview process).

This morning, I got a canned email thanking me for my interest and encouraging me to apply for future positions of interest.

I am really disappointed that this didn’t pan out, and I really want to know what went wrong. 

Did I not have a key qualification? Was there a personality mismatch? Or did they simply retain the other contractor? 

I know these are questions that I won’t get answers too, so instead of dwelling on it, I’m trying to figure out what I can do to improve as a candidate for similar roles in the future."
Consistent late responses after job interview.,"I have had 3 job interviews for 3 positions in the media/marketing field. For the first, I was asked to complete a mini social media campaign project after my interview, which I did and submitted on time. I received a follow up the next week thanking me for sending it in and they'd be in touch by the end of the week.

For the second position, my references were contacted and they responded that day.

For the third, I traveled 2 hours for an in-person interview, they were late to start, disorganized, and were not interested in looking at examples of my videography.

I did not feel great about the third interview, but for all three I did not receive any communication by the time they'd said they'd get back to me by. It was only until after sending them an email that I got a response saying another applicant had been selected.

I find this so disheartening. Is this so typical?"
Is it a wise to apply to a new position opening in a company listing right after your application for another postion (within the same company) is rejected?,"So around two weeks ago I sent my resume in to this position within a company. Received the standard rejection letter today ' we regret to inform you that we have decided not to move forward with your application for this role. We will keep your resume on file for future opportunities.' blah blah blah

Checked the companies vacancy list and saw another position( quite a different position than the last one, quality assurance testor vs customer service rep) that I reckon I have the experience and ability for.

I'm just wondering if its wise to put in another application? Since the recruiters must have just seen my last resume & cover letter would that create a bad impression?

P.S: I really liked the company that im applying for (yeah I know it sounds a bit naive and stupid) and really wanted to work for them and thats why I want to keep trying."
"Rejected for a job I really wanted, feeling demoralized, any tips on picking yourself back up?","So I have a decent job but it's at an incredibly small office (seriously, I'm the only employee at the moment) with no room for growth so I've been looking for a new job on and off for about a year, more seriously on for about 3 months now. About a week ago, my friend referred me to a great job at a pretty awesome company, in the city I'm looking to move to. I had a phone interview the next day, recruiter really liked me, they scheduled me for an onsite interview about 24 hours later.

The interview was an hour and a half (not with the recruiter, with 3 other people) and I thought I did pretty well. My friend who referred me said I had a good shot. Recruiter really liked me. I was trying to not get too excited, but I was feeling pretty good. Got a call yesterday being told that I didn't get the job. Recruiter said he really doesn't get very much feedback ""in these kind of situations"" when I asked for some, but did say that there were a ton of other referrals and it was very competitive, and that he would like to stay in contact with me.

I don't know why this is getting me so down. This was the first really good lead I've gotten in my job search, it's hard to believe I'll get another one. Does anyone have any tips on staying positive when something like this happens? I know that things like this happen all the time, but I dunno, I just feel really demoralized right now.

tldr: Got a job interview that I thought I did well on for a job I think would've been perfect for me, didn't get the job. How do you keep chugging even when you feel demoralized?"
How to maintain optimism after 200+ applications?,"I graduated in May 2019 with a BS in History of Science and Technology and with several years experience in microbiology lab work. However, over the last 3 months I have put out over 200 applications and have yet to get a single interview. I've had my resume checked by others and write custom cover letters, but it is becoming soul draining to just get auto-generated rejection emails or to hear nothing at all.  
I have seen suggestions of just keeping ones head up and toughing through it, but I am unsure how to do so."
Mental Health during a job search,"So I've been unemployed/underemployed for a while. It really eats at me with each failure and has affected my mental well being. I have a JD, but have been unable to pass the Bar exam and feel stuck in purgatory. Went to a top 20 uni and I've been fortunate enough to be a low level employee on a few national campaigns.  Despite all this I've been stuck in an underemployed situation, which has just eaten away at any self worth I had. 

I've had multiple positive interviews, but each one has resulted in a rejection. A few rejections were personalized to my interview, a few have even talked about how impressed they were with the last campaign I worked on. As nice as it is to hear I'm just tired of this cycle. I've given up time sacrificing my fourth of July weekend to work on a project for a potential employer or a friend's Bachelor Party another weekend because the interview schedule. The worst part is that same amount of hope that appears every time I interview, I wish it just didn't exist.

I really feel just tired of it all, sometimes I just don't even care to apply and kind of want to just end it. Just that same process of interview see some slight hope and then lose, it feels like purgatory. I know I need to find a healthy outlet, but really therapy or anything similar is out of the question as I just can't justify that expense. I have tried it before and I just hated knowing how much they were paid with how little they offered. Maybe the third time is the charm, but it feels like a huge risk in cost versus reward.  I feel hopeless and angry knowing a recession could be coming while I still can't find anything. This unemployment feels like my life is just passing by. I don't know why I am trying to even focus on this, but alcohol is neither a good solution nor is an absence of anything. I figured there are tougher people here with some good advice or suggestions. Perhaps there is nothing, but I figured I would check, I owe it to my friends and family for a few final shots at fixing this.

TLDR: What advice would you give for maintaining mental health during a job search?"
Should I go to a company’s hiring event after they’ve rejected my application?,"A company is having a hiring event two weeks from now but they’ve encouraged to sign their online application for a easier process. I signed their application yesterday and today they said they won’t be moving forward with my application. 

Just wondering if I should still attend the hiring event in order to try again or would that be inappropriate?

Thank you :)


edit: spelling and phrasing"
Not a “cultural fit” for a job?,"Hey y’all.

Recently been interviewing for various jobs and have put a lot of time and effort into it.

I’ve had many rejections, but this rejection stung the most. I put so much thought, time, care, and initiative into this company and thought I’d at least have a decent chance at the position.

I was rejected, which is okay with me, but as long as I can receive some feedback and continue to improve. 

However, I was told that there was nothing I could improve on for the future, it’s just that I was not a “cultural fit.” Like what?

I’m trying to wrap my head around what this means. I thought I connected well with the interviewer. No awkward pauses, no “wrong” answers, and there were no questions during the actual interview that seemed to involve “culture”. 

That being said, this job was very competitive, so maybe I simply was good but just not good enough. Maybe they had their eye on someone else already.

What I’m interested in : what does “cultural fit” mean within a company and how can managers try to find a good fit during an interview?

Thanks!

**TL;DR** a bit sad because a job rejected me for no reason other than being “not a cultural fit.” Looking for some explanation and insight"
Needing some input or suggestions concerning job hunt or resume,"Hey everyone. Looking for some insight. I've been out of work for well over a year now (left on rough terms for good reason though). Nonetheless, everything I've applied to I'm turned down. Fast food? ""I'm overqualified"" ; anything in the restaurant business? ""Not enough experience"" ; anything office or customer service related? ""You must speak spanish"" ; the last job that was lined up, the person called my old boss who made it so I wouldn't be hired. I'm at a loss. Can anyone give me some ideas? Thanks in advance."
My SO is frustrated with her string of extremely short term jobs. Has anyone else dealt with this problem?,"My SO is getting upset with getting jobs that only last a few weeks at most. She’s been trying to get admin assistant or receptionist jobs, and she’s been getting a lot of temp to hire and direct hire jobs, but none seem to last. She’s not doing anything crazy or stupid to get fired. 

One job lasted a month and her manager didn’t have time to train her and fired her for lack of performance. Another job lasted two weeks and her supervisor complained about everything she did. The super complained that she didn’t separate the business owner’s personal mail from the business mail (both with the same address), to the angle of the staples was wrong, among other things. Even still, she got data entry job through an agency, it lasted one day. She showed up. She was told she was doing a good job, and by the end of the day, she was told that her assignment ended. 

Most recently, she got a receptionist job that was temp to hire through another agency. She was doing good last week. Today is Monday, she walks in and is told by management that her assignment ends today and that her last assignment is to train her replacement. She was told that she had to stay, but she said that there was a family medical emergency and she left. Apparently the agency didn’t know that the company was going to do that. 

I want to emphasize that she hasn’t done anything “to get fired”. She doesn’t partake in drugs or alcohol, and is punctual and polite. She’s currently seeing a career counselor to help her find quality jobs that will be good for her. 

I’ve never had this problem, I’ve had jobs that lasted a few months, but nothing that’s lasted just days or weeks. Has anyone else experience this type of bs, in which companies are fickle? Has anyone had a string of jobs that were promising, but you were fired or laid-off within weeks, and you’re unsure why? Any sympathy or advice is appreciated."

How to save yourself after you knowingly failed an interview?,"I had a group interview for a seasonal position at Bath and Body Works which consisted of about 12 people. I managed to get there 15 minutes before the scheduled time but some people showed up late. 
I'm extremely introverted so speaking in front of a group really isn't my forte. However I did add in a few comments and listened to whatever other people had to say. The manager asked just about 2 questions (what does good customer service look to you, how did you prioritize tasks) I stayed quiet most of the time because even the manager took some time talking about other customer's experiences and everybody else had something to say. By the time my time would come around she's already decided to move onto something else. I wanted to punch myself in the face for not saying anything.
I managed to ask a few questions (ie how do you keep up with the new lines that come out every month and if they've started using online receipts because other people tend to lose their physical copies) but that was about it.

the TL;DR version is that I am an international student on post graduate OPT that have been moved to Portland OR for two and a half months and living with my aunt, but to no avail so far. 

Yesterday I got an irrelevant job offer for a position of production technician at a semi-conductor factory (\*\*before you ask, I cannot work on this because my OPT stated that everything I do must be directly related to my major\*\*), and Just this morning I woke up to another rejection email, an ""Unlimited Earning Potential!"" MLM spam, and another Google Hangouts ""Interview"" scam. My aunt has set a deadline that I have to move out by the end of September, and on top of that I have my visa that I have to worry about (90 days or leave the country). I just can't stand that I always got beaten to the punch by other candidates even I have the exact skills matched. 

I am looking into freelancing on Upwork, but their verification process for any US based jobs is a huge pain. I also had a Skype interview with one of the small agency that specializes in data visualization, and the hiring manager hinted about a potential internship opportunity but said that he needs another couple of weeks to go through the current lot of candidates. My major concern right now is to find opportunity to allow me to stay in the US, including relocation to other places such as Phoenix,AZ; San Francisco, CA (ugh) and any major metro areas in Texas. I am also seriously looking to transition into a front end web developer, as I have some HTML/CSS experiences and UI/UX skills, but I don't have the money to pay for UO's coding boot camp. (I cannot borrow student loans since I'm a foreigner) 

So right now I'm stuck at a limbo. As I am waiting for the agency to call back to me, I am not sure what steps I should take next. Should I relocate? Should I stay in Portland to go for the coding boot camp? Or should I continue spraying and praying? I am really confused right now, and any answers will be greatly appreciated. 

(TL;DR: Foreign student on F1 OPT in Portland OR area, spent two and a half months job hunting to no avail. Currently waiting for hearing back from another company, but clock is ticking and I don't have much options)"
Tips to avoid bitterness?,"To keep the background short, I've been job hunting for well over a year, and nightmare interview stories aside, 0 success. 

/rant

The problem Ive recently encountered is, i've become so, so, bitter about the whole thing. Every time I see ""entry level"" I can basically already guess it's gonna want 5-7 years experience plus a phd. Every time I get a message on indeed that they insist i need to respond to, I can already guess it's an automated ""we moved on"" or some other form of automated message because no human being bothered to even look at my application and hired the boss' friend's kid. 

&#x200B;

Soon, I'll be starting an MBA and while I do have valuable business, internship and career experience, i'm currently a waiter after bailing on an EXTREMELY toxic workplace, and getting back to a business position has just been absolutely crushing. ( seriously, i once had an interviewer suggest i start as a busboy in the office building's cafeteria?) ultimately. it just makes me bitter as hell and completely un-motivated. why should I care about these companies when the recruiter doesn't even remember my name? why should I be so content to treat these interviewers like gods, when they'll throw my application in the trash if I so much as blink at the wrong time? 

/rant

All in all, im really just feeling totally burned out and bitter, does anyone have any advice on dealing with this?"
How do I disclose an arrest that brought no charges and was dropped?,"A month ago I was arrested with a third degree felony. I was never arraigned and eventually the case was disposed. While applying to jobs, how would I disclose to future recruiters/HR staff, my situation? 

I was employed by NASA before I was arrested and unfortunately my supervisor decided to terminate me before I could explain what happened (I was still on my year long probationary period). 

I have had some recruiters ask me why I left NASA and have been stumped as to how to word what I need to say."
I was just denied a job because of defaulted student loans after a credit check. Is this common?,"I was all excited to leave my shitty line cook job, about to jump from 12.50/hr to between 15 and 17.25/hr with pretty decent benefits, working in a call center for a local bank. I nailed the interview, was called and told I had the job later that day on friday, now today I get a call saying the credit check showed my defaulted loans and I cant be hired per protocol and it is out of the managers hands even though they really liked me. I am in a loan rehab program but I am on payment 7 or 8 so maybe I havent made enough payments for them to officially come out of default. But still, I nearly put in my two weeks the other day and I would have looked like an ass or have been royally screwed. Is this a common thing for any job or is this mostly because I would have been working in a bank setting? Thanks!"
Reapplying for a job I was rejected to last year,"Last year, I went through 3 interviews for this organization, provided references etc etc, was told that I was one of the top two candidates only to receive a phone call in the end and be told that the offer was given to someone else. The woman I spoke with was apologetic, said she was upset with the decision herself, and told me that she would keep my resume on file. I was upset and figured all of these comments were fillers and just said thank you and moved on. 

They recently posted a job similar to the one from last year. I'm going to reapply and submit my updated resume and cover letter and I'm wondering would it be unprofessional or too eager to reach out to the woman I was corresponding with last year to let her know that I am reapplying for the position so she remembers who I am? She still works with the organization so I'm not worried about my email bouncing.

Also, if anyone has been through a similar situation, would you mind sharing what your experience was like?"
"After phone screening, was told about upcoming interview. Seemed to be ghosted, asked for update and now received a generic rejection","Basically title.  I had a phone screening interview with a company. Everything went well and she asked for a salary range, I gave her one and she said that would definitely work.  I was told that they would set up on-site interviews but didn't hear from them for over a week.  I then asked the HR person if there was any update.  Today I received a generic HR email stating that the position is better suited for the qualifications of another candidate.   Was it the salary range that caused this? I was fully qualified for the position based on requirements and job description."
What am I doing wrong? Always get rejected after interviews,"I started applying to jobs in my chosen field about a year before I finished my masters, so let’s say summer 2017.  Between then and December 2018, I put in nearly 400 applications to local, state and federal agencies (mostly state though). Finally in December 2018 I picked up a job with the state, but it’s not even remotely close to my field and the pay is awful.

Since then I’ve focused on applying to jobs in my field. Again, I believe I’m up to nearly 100 apps with nothing to show for it. And today I got rejected from yet another interview, except this time it’s my ideal career that has rejected me. I’m absolutely crushed.

I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I have three bachelors degrees and a masters, so I definitely meet qualifications. But so far every interview I’ve done has ended in failure. I’ve researched interview techniques and have a nice succinct party line for the one job that released me (rather than me leaving). Yet I am continually rejected. I’m trying to not give up but atm I’m losing hope.

Any suggestions as to things I can change, do, alter, learn, or literally anything I can do to make it past the interview stage?"
Rescinded job offer. What to I tell potential employers?,"I just lost a job offer four days from my start date. My last job elected to let me go when I gave them my two weeks notice so I've been just doing chores these last two weeks.

It was my own fault that the offer was rescinded, I screwed up in a not-even-funny kind of way. But now I don't know how forward to be about my last month of employment with any potential employers.

It went kind of like this working-> applying for jobs while I worked-> get an offer quickly -> start new job after I finish two last weeks-> two days in, get another offer from an undeniably better job who took their time responding-> submit two weeks notice-> they let me go early so they're not paying too train me for labor they won't use-> 4 days before start date at new job, the offer is rescinded.

This is the first time I've been unemployed since high school and I'm not really prepared for it financially or mentally. I don't know how to explain this on my resume other than a gap in employment that gets worse the more an employer might ask about it. Please advise."
Got rejected after 3rd interview,"I had my third interview with a job I really wanted earlier this week. I was informed over email yesterday that I didn’t get the position. I’m really bummed. I’ve been unemployed a little over two months now and I was really optimistic about this one. My first two interviews went really well. The third one was alright, but I was uncomfortable (it was really hot and I was in my room interviewing via webcam and was literally dripping with sweat halfway through the interview). It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t my best. I just feel rejected and sad and a bit defeated. I’m trying not to wallow. I’m trying to tell myself that after only two months, getting this close to a job is an accomplishment. But I can’t shake the sadness and dejection I feel.


I guess I’d like some reassurance. Am I going to be ok? How do you guys practice self care after a rejection from something you were really looking forward to and optimistic about?"
How do you get over job rejection?,How do you get over the feeling? I tried so hard also for the interview?
One thing I have consistently learned the hard way: the only way to know if you have gotten the job is if you get an offer,"I have attended way too many interviews where I felt I nailed the interview and I was sure I had gotten the job. I have been told my written assignments were the best. Only to get a regret letter. Pro tip: after the interview no matter how good it went, move on and act as if you did not get the job. I just received my latest rejection letter and just moved on to my next application. 

EDIT: whoa, you guys have had worse experiences than myself. To update, the only way you know you have gotten the job is get an offer letter, have it in written formed and signed, and getting paid the first salary."
"Mental problems after sexual assault has left a gap in my CV, and now no one will hire me.","I hope this is the right place for this, as I'm feeling incredibly hopeless and beat down.

A little over two years ago I was sexually assaulted while still in college. It's not something I like to talk about as it still affects me, but back when it happened it really... well, it ruined my life. I started failing my classes and had to postpone my studies - summer vacation came and I couldn't get a job since I was having constant panic-attacks and anxiety that was through the roof (I went to therapy for this, but that fell through pretty quickly).

Before I could get back up and continue (and finish) my studies it had been one year. I finished my BA in Literature and communications this June, and I have been applying for jobs since then with no luck. At first I thought it had to do with me being under-qualified for the jobs I was applying for, so I applied for lower paying jobs. I then got a few calls from employers asking why I was applying for those jobs, since I was ""overqualified"" for them. I tried talking my way past that, but they insisted so I went back to applying for the jobs I thought I would then be qualified for.

I have been doing so for a while now, calling in and trying to get an interview, and last week I finally got someone who called me back. However, they simply called to comment on my CV, and pretty much said ""You have a gap on your CV, and it's unimpressive"". I explained the situation then (without going in to too much detail), and while that made them a bit more understanding I was told that they had unfortunately moved on in the process and couldn't help me.

So... I'm at a loss of what to do. I can't explain the gap in my CV without getting an interview, but I don't seem to be getting interviews because of the gap in my CV. I can't just call employers around saying ""Hi, I just applied for a job at your company, and if you notice that there's a gap in my CV here's my mental history and why that is"".

I just need to get that first foot in, but I don't know how I'm supposed to do that now. And I'm feeling so distressed and ruined if this one thing that destroyed me two years ago, and has been haunting me since, is now also going to have an affect on my professional career. I just want to move one. I want to become a working part of society.

Is there anyone who's been in a similar situation, or who has an idea or two of what I can do?

&#x200B;

Edit: Perhaps I should have included some more information while first posting this - I have not outright written a gap in my resume. I haven't written ""Education 2014-2016 cont. 2018"" or something of the sorts. But my credits/points (I don't know what's correct, sorry for the confusion) account for 3 years of education (in Sweden) and my start of studies and end of studies are 4 years apart. And as I did not work during the following summer, there's also no employment listed during of that year."
"Got offered a job, and then the company changed their mind","I applied for this job, interviewed and was offered a position. Gave them my availability, told them I would change my availability at my other job to fit this one, and begin filling out all of the necessary paper work. Today I got a call from them saying that they’re not going to offer me the position anymore (but they look forward to seeing my application again in the future). Luckily my manager was still there, so right after I finished the phone call, I walked to the back, and told my manager to ignore the new availability sheet I gave him. It sucks because I was excited to get into the company because I would like to eventually have a career there once I finish school, however though, I don’t know how to feel about it now since they offered me a job, had me do all of the paper work, only to tell me that they’re no longer offering me the position , and then having the audacity to tell me that they look forward to seeing my application again in the future"
What Am I Doing Wrong?,"I don’t know what I’m doing wrong with putting into jobs. The last job I had screwed me over by taking away my benefits and lying to me I could get them back and then not following through and me getting pissed and pretty much cussing out the guy in HR. Yeah that was my fault, but they also treated my like crap so getting let go was a blessing more than anything. I have since then put into about 30+ jobs for an internship through my colleges job fair as well as I have applied to many jobs that lied about their job description and wanted me to do extra jobs on top of what I paid for or lied about having to commute and do on site repairs or applying for a job and then starting me for a completely different job I didn’t even apply for. I have had such bad luck with jobs just not working out for me and I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. So far I have put in over 72+ applications and haven’t heard anything back from them."
Can't find a part time job that doesn't require Saturdays...am a mother with no daycare that day. Any suggestions?,"Does anyone know of any career path or something that wouldn't be retail that doesn't require Saturday hours? I literally have applied to so many jobs and most turn me down because of Saturdays. Any ideas anyone? I have 0 help, live in a state far away from my family, and have a sitter every day except tuesdays and saturdays. So frustraing lol"
How do you deal with job application fatigue?,"I’m currently employed and have been trying to look for work out of state. My fiancé was relocated out of state and I have been trying to find work in his current city. I feel unemployed, despite still having a full-time job and a decent paycheck.

I’ve been looking on and off since April of this year. I have a feeling I’m gonna have a hard time even when I move to his city.

Job seekers, how do you deal with job app fatigue? I’m not even unemployed! Ugh."
Rejected but with a silver lining. How can I leverage it and turn it into something positive?,"I went into an interview last Friday for a small wallpaper company (5-6 person) and the interviewer was impressed by my works, and said she will reach out by today. Still, I mentally brace myself for a rejection from my experience last 3 months. 

This morning, I did got a rejection as I anticipated.  She told me that  they're impressed by my works, but they feel like I'm overqualified as they won't be able to give me tasks that would unleash my potential. However, there's a silver lining as she said she will forward my reference to her colleague that is a professional designer in the city, which I assume is the owner of the firm since the interviewer did mentioned that the owner is a well connected designer in the city (Portland OR FYI, which is an incredibly hard market to break into), and the firm has only a handful of employees around. I have already sent her a thank you note letting me know their decisions, and I plan to leverage this feedback and turn it into something useful. (At least I know it's not a robotic email)

My plan is to give her a call and told her that I acknowledged that email I received, and ask to stay in touch with email and ask for a connection on LinkedIn, though I'm not sure which profile is hers since she wasn't listed at the firm that she's currently working at. My question is, do you think it's appropriate to give her a call to acknowledge the email and ask to keep in touch through LinkedIn? To be honest I really feel like this is a very bold move, as any missteps could jeopardize my future."
Why am I being denied for basic jobs that I know I'm qualified for?,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I've been applying to a lot of jobs recently (mostly administrative assistant type jobs) and I have been denied for almost all of them before being contacted for an interview (in the application portal it says ""others more competitive""). I don't understand. These are entry level jobs and while I have never been an administrative or office assistant, I have had other jobs that I believe make me more than qualified. Why am I getting denied so quickly?"
Rejected after a paid lunch,"I applied for this job, and got a phone interview. It went really well. They interviewer was very impressed and kept saying she loved what I was saying. A couple of weeks later I went back for in person interview that also went well, and the guy was super impressed. After I got invited back for a third interview that was lunch with the interviewers. They took me out and paid for my lunch and kept saying I can’t wait to see you in a couple of weeks and such. Today, I received an automated email saying that I wasn’t selected for the position. I don’t know what I did wrong."
How should I decline a job offer?,"I was emailed out of the blue about a position at another company (I was originally eager to work for a while back) that was open a couple days ago and they answered my questions.  They said if I was interested, they will give me a contract to read.  Over time I didn't really find the answer I like.  But after consideration, I've decided I am not ready to work for this company as I already have another job but not ready to take on the tasks of being a contractor job, which I would not be working as a company but a self employment.  So should I politely reject by email or by calling them?"
Best way to keep positive during the hunt?,"Hello this type of question has likely been asked before but I feel like I need to ask for advice 

Im 25 and graduated 3 years ago in HR management with college qualifications in administration. Ive since then been trying to seek out work in theses area but have only been able to find part time roles in retail as pretty much every role in my area (north scotland) is demanding multiple years experience for basic entry roles even in some volunteer roles. I tried a shift in career in labwork in optical but was made redundant and replaced by someone with over 15 years experience 3 months ago and been applying for new work since working with the job centre and friends. 

Ive had a few interviews but Im starting to feel extremely drained after multiple rejections from interviews this week alone or applied jobs over the last few months let alone the past years

And thus I ask for those in a similar state or been through one your best advice to keep at it as Im struggling to get going on some days now

Many thanks"
Previous manager won't give my girlfriend a reference - advice needed,"I am writing this on behalf of my partner - she's having the work issues but I am running out of ideas on how to advise her.

This is might be a long one so apologies for length.  Plus, I should add, this is everything I have been told from my girlfriend's perspective, so happy for people to play devil's advocate.

My girlfriend started a new job at the start of the year, as maternity cover, at a university.  Prior to that, she'd been at the same company for 6 years (interrupted by a year maternity leave), during which she was promoted several times.  And prior to that, she has been a longstanding employee at several other jobs.  I would say she is a model employee.

She left at the end of 2018, for a new challenge, and soon started the new job.  She was trained up in the role by the lady for which she was covering.  The role was, in basic terms, preparing for an event happening about 4 months from her start date.But after that lady went on her own maternity leave, my gf soon learned a few things about the role:

* No-one, other than the lady now on maternity leave, seemed to know what was expected of the role, in terms of procedures or outcome.
* The role was unique to that university - very few, if any, other universities have a similar role.  It's incorporated into different departments at other universities, so using another university as a gauge as to what was expected wasn't an option.
* My gf wouldn't have a manager for a couple of months, so she was pretty much left to figure things out, unguided, and instigate programmes and procedures for which she had basic training.  Which naturally led to errors.

So my girlfriend, for the first couple of months, felt undersupported and undertrained.

She then got a new manager after a couple of months.  This manager was promoted from within the university, from another department.  As much as I know about her, I would say she is a yes person.  Tells the bosses what they want to hear to cover her own back.  A jobsworth.

Things got difficult with the manager really quickly.  Errors started popping up in the run up to the event.  the manager would expect my GF just to perform tasks for which my GF had no training.  When my GF asked her new manager for extra support, or if she could come in on weekends or work late, to prepare for this event, every request was met with a 'no' with various different reasons.

3 months passed in the job and my GF had her mandatory probationary period review.  And in that review the manager tore her apart.  Basically said my gf was underperforming drastically and if the manager didnt see any improvement, she'd seek to terminate her employment within 3 weeks.

The list of complaints (which I saw) were insanely detailed and epically long.  Like the manager had been detailing every error as they happened to cover her own back, rather than try and solve the issues as they arose with my gf.

My GF asked for a meeting with HR, in which she gave her own version of events (no support, refusal to requests).  Naturally, as you would expect, the manager disputed this.  Which left my gf felt like she was facing a path of being let go in 3 weeks.  If she was unsupported in the run up to this meeting, why would she be supported in the next 3 weeks, in an effort to save her job?

So she resigned - she had my full backing to do it.  She wasn't happy.  Why stay in a job if you aren't happy?

&#x200B;

That was about 2 months ago.  My GF has since been looking for work.  She has had a couple of promising interviews.  One company was very interested.  Practically offered her the job.

They asked for her references, to which she gave several.  But then the hammer blow - 'we'd also like a reference from your previous manager'

I think you can guess what happened next - my girlfriend, reluctantly, contacted the manager to ask for a reference and the manager refused.

And the job offer was rescinded.

So my question is:  is there anything she can do in future (or to respond to this job offer that was rescinded)?  How can she broach this with future employers?  It's frustrating to think that this one terrible experience might hamper her work opportunities.

Or should she considered short term contracts so she then has more recent managers to call on for references?

Cheers for any advice."
Failed my first job interview ever—advice?,"Hello reddit. I’m a 17 year old who just had a very bad interview experience. This was my first interview ever and I blew it! I went in for an interview to become a lifeguard and I messed up on one component during the practical skills portion of the interview.

I feel terrible. I keep replaying the interview in my head and regret the small (yet crucial) actions that I made that led me to failure. I haven’t slept at all this past week because I’ve been too nervous for the interview, however I guess I won’t be sleeping well now either.

The upside is that they’re offering me a second chance (yay!) next week. I know I can pull it off, and hopefully the employers saw that today. Even thought I have this second opportunity, I can’t stop feeling like a failure for what happened today. 

I know I will encounter more interview fails in my future, but it doesn’t lessen the blow from this one. What do you guys do when you’ve failed an interview?"
How do I turn down a job offer after salary negotiation?,"I received a job offer in a different part of the country for £20,000. I initially turned down the opportunity due my current salary of £22,000.

The manager then queried if I would still be interested if they were able to match my salary to which I agreed. He then spoke to seniors at the firm and came back with an offer of £22,500.

However, after assessing the costs of moving and the cost of living in the new location I have decided to stay at the job I am currently at. There is also opportunity for a promotion that has recently come up which has also swayed my decision.

What would be the best way to reject the job offer? I do not want to come across as though I have wasted the company’s time (although I agree I may have). Any thoughts would be much appreciated."
Have you ever just been bad at a job ?,"Every job I have ever had I have just been bad at regardless of what it was. I come to work on time, never call in sick, I have a pleasing character from what I have been told but I am just never really good at the work I am doing or any job I have had. Anyone else know someone like this or has had a similar experience. what do you do in a situation where you wanna do good work but it seems like no matter how hard you try you are just not good at the jobs you get. Thanks y'all."
"Rejected, but encouraged to apply for other positions. Sincere or standard BS?","The supervisor called me and told me I was not chosen, but encouraged me to apply for future positions. Was she being sincere or was is just her trying to make me feel less rejected? 

I was shocked she would call to reject me instead of sending an email, so I just said thanks for the call instead of asking for feedback on why I didn’t get the job."
Rejected because I didn’t have an “adaptable skillset”,"what does this mean, it’s for a hotel job I’m pretty disappointed??"
Could some interpret this email I just received...did I just get rejected?,"Okay so I applied for a position a few weeks ago and just now received an email from, according to her email signature, a secretary. The email said, “in regards to your application please see the attached letter from professor...” okay a little weird but I think this has happened once before, I was expecting a rejection letter. The professor was also CC.

So I open the letter and it says, “thank you for your submitting an application for....you will be contacted again only in the event of further interest in your credentials. Your interest is appreciated and we wish you well in your professional endeavors.”

So I’m confused. Yes, literally it means I will be contacted if they are interested, but why was it done like this? What could be the motive or purpose? Why one email basically leasing to another? Why this effort and not just say, “yes come in for an interview” or “no we are not interested?”

Or was this their way of rejecting me?

Any ideas?"

Give me and others a bit of hope.,"22. Recent graduate - 


I’ve been applying for jobs consistently mostly entry level ones but with no luck. I did get invited to attend a few interviews though. However; I’m still here...jobless. 

I’m in desperate need of hope. I feel like giving up. 

How long did it take you to land a job? And for those of you who are currently in my situation, how long have you been unemployed for? 

Edit: Thank you all so much for leaving a comment and sharing your experience/advice. I appreciate it!

It's comforting to know that you are not alone in any of your struggles, this one in particular. I hope I can come back with an update soon. The purpose of this post was to help myself and others to not lose hope and feel alone. 
I wish you all the absolute best. :)

UPDATE: If anyone happens to come across this post, don’t give up. I finally got a job after almost 7 months! && it’s also related to my degree!
Remember everything really does happen for a reason. With every rejection you face, you are one step CLOSER to getting accepted. Hang in there :)"
Anyone ever had the experience of applying to a job but your friend got the offer instead?,"This friend and I are both on the same career path. However, she got the job from a company I was interviewing for. Any advice on not thinking too much about it or getting negative energy from it?"
Should I phone back this employer?,"A month ago I applied for a software co-op position with Employer 1. I got an interview, after which they said they said I wasn't qualified, but they liked me a lot and got me an interview with their hardware team (who had no co-op position plans at the time) instead as this was more in my domain and they might want to hire a co-op. I was thrilled with this, and the interview went very well. They asked me for references and said they'd get back to me early in the next week. On Friday of that next week, they sent me an e-mail saying they hit a budget snag and would get back to me after a budget meeting the week after, and wanted to let me know in case I had any other offers or options in there interim. I said no, and that I was happy to wait, and they said they'd be i contact.

Of course, right after I sent that email, I got another interview (which also went well, but I wouldn't end up getting an offer for) and employer 2 said they'd get back to me the next day. This prompted me to send Employer 1 an e-mail asking when their meeting was and when I could expect to hear back. This was two weeks ago and I have heard nothing. 

Would it be reasonable to now give them a phone call and ask about the position, and if they aren't giving me an offer, whether it was for qualification concerns or budget issues? Or should it be obvious that they're blowing me off? The fact that they emailed me about the budget problem, instead of just denying me, makes me think that they would have given me an offer if there wasnt a monetary issue...but it has been forever since my last contact...but I also know these kinds of things can take forever on the corporate end. 

This would be a wonderful work term that would absolutely jumpstart my career in this field so I really feel like I should persist a little, just in case.

Timeline for clarity:

Week 1: Phone interview on Tuesday

Week 2: Worksite interview on Friday

Week 3: Email on Friday about the budget meeting

Week 4: Tuesday I email asking about when I can expect to hear back

Week 5: Nada

Week 6: Now"
Did I mess up somewhere in the interview process?,"Hello guys,

I need some assistance digesting this. Recently I applied to the creative department in a company located in NYC. I immediately received a response, asking to set some time for a phone interview with the Creative Director. It lasted approximately 30 minutes and it seemed like I gave a good impression since she would discuss benefits and the next steps of the interview process.

A few days later, I arrive at the office within 10-15 mins of my interview. The Creative Director sort of sat me in and told me that our interview would have to be cut short due to a impromptu meeting they had with members of the department. I don't know this was this person was attempting to psych me out or test me but I told her that it wouldn't be a problem for me to have a 20 minute interview. It was fairly casual with her asking me the typical questions and me answering them and also showing my portfolio. Her body language seemed friendly. Was impressed with my accomplishments. She informed along the way that I am being considered as a final candidate for this position.

We temporarily depart and she informs me that she'd be sending me a ""test"" for me to check out while she was busy in her meeting. I didn't have to work on it, I had until Monday to send in it, and I am free to ask any questions when she gets back. I check it out but sit outside the company's office, decompressing.

She comes back and invites me for the second part of our interview. She showed me around the office and brought me into a room where she says I would work in, informing me that the last person who had this job left for another opportunity. I didn't ask that. She just informed me. I sat down and spoke to her for several minutes, showing her more stuff from my portfolio and she looked impressed. She told me to sit back and brought three more people from the department. I answered questions and showed them pieces from my portfolio. I took the chance to ask them questions because what other alternative is there? They laughed and answered with complete enthusiasm. I smiled. This went back and forth for a bit until I was out of stuff to ask and they didn't have more questions for me. In total, the interview altogether lasted about an hour and some change, close to two hours. At the end, someone from the team walked me out of the office and escorted me to the elevator. I shook everyone's hands.

I sent her a thank you letter because tradition. I did the job test the next day though her email implied that it had to be done on that day (while stating that I had until Monday). I did it within a day I was assigned it. Waited until the weekend, got a response today in the morning and told me she'd be reviewing it. About two hours later, I got the following rejection email from the HR rep:

Dear X

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us for a Digital Designer position with Y. Although your qualifications are impressive, after careful consideration we have decided to pursue another candidate. We will keep your resume on file and will contact you if a suitable position becomes available.

Thank you for your interest in our brand,  We wish you the best of luck in your career search.

Sincerely,

Z

So I'm just sitting here wondering. Did I do something wrong? I know I'm not going to get a honest answer to as to why I wasn't put to further consideration nor does it matter. I have to look elsewhere and hope for a yes. It's just incredibly frustrating."
Am I the only one who gets annoyed by that?,"*""After* **carefully** *reviewing your qualifications, we decided to pursue other candidates who we feel more closely meet our needs at this time"".*   


I mean, I sometimes get this response within 10 min. How is that careful? It more feels like they are teasing people. Why is it considered polite?"
Multiple interviews but no offers... are you always the problem?,"I've been on 6 interviews since I was let go from my social media position at a mid-level cosmetics brand in April. Not my fault at all, but that's another story. I've been told I interview very well. I research the company, bring a portfolio of work, use the STAR method, etc. and people really seem to like me... yet I have no offers. When you have multiple interviews but no offers, are you always the problem?

It is worth noting that I live in a very competitive market (Los Angeles) in a very competitive field (social media/copywriting). Most of my interviews have been with very high-profile companies. Two household name beauty brands, a marketing agency working with some of the top shows on TV, a huge TV corporation, a nationwide hair salon, etc. These positions probably have hundreds of qualified applicants, so I'm trying not to let it get me down... but it's hard. Am I definitely the problem, or are there situations where it's just a matter of luck?"
Reapply to same job after not passing assesment,I applied for a entry level job that only requires  customer service experience which I have. I applied and took the assessment test and received an automatic rejection. What's your opinion on creating a new profile under a new email and reapply to see if I pass it another go around?
"Chemical engineer, Can't find a job. What else should I do? looking for advice.","It's been two years out of university, I found a position as a supervisor for a small laboratory. But I wanted to get more onto the industrial side of things.

I've applied to a LOT of positions with little to no luck. I am going back to university for a masters, but I feel like it might be useless, as I couldn't even find a job as a chemical engineer bachelors. 

I'm starting to wonder if there are better options in another technical field. Do you have any advice?"

Terminated 13 years ago still being held against me.,I recently took a civil service exam scored 6 out of several hundred people got an interview. During the interview I was asked a specific question about whether I had ever been asked to resign and I answered yes. I was on my initial probation as a corrections officer and was late twice in 2 months both less than 15 minutes. I totally own this as my screw up but it wasn't due to being totally irresponsible. I joke about not having anything to show for being late like partying hard the night before or something. I was working too much overtime because I was excited about the job and wanted to learn every post in the facility so I could make myself more valuable and less expendable.  This caught up with me and affected my sleep. I was in my 20's and a lot has changed since. Everyone I talked to from the department said that I was railroaded out by a boss notorious for having bad days. Still I take responsibility for my shortcoming but I feel that answering the question honestly cost me this job opportunity 13 years later. Mind you the same department brought back a guy who beat  up his wife and went on the run for a few days. I feel like this will continue to happen whenever I apply for a decent job. I know that lying or omitting is bad and I would never consider it but don't know what to do. I have a squeaky clean record all around and I have worked mediocre jobs with no problems since so I don't think it's fair to have one slight blemish like this hold me back from advancing myself especially when I know of many others have actually screwed up a hell of a lot worse yet some how were able to land on their feet. Any suggestions? And yes I have taken responsibility for my past mistake so I don't need people reminding me of that. Thanks.
Bad idea to reapply for a job that ended in rejection 2 months earlier?,"So roughly 2 months ago in June, I went to an interview that ended badly for lack of better words. The interview did not go very far since the company was looking for someone who was willing to work long hours, weekends, and long term. I was hesitant and HR noticed right away. The interview ended pretty abruptly, so there was not much of a chance to get to know me as a person. 

Would it be a bad idea to ask for a second reconsideration if the position is still open? From what I can tell, job spotters still see now hiring sign at least 10 days ago. I was interviewing for a similar job but, I would like this job cause it was a shorter commute and slightly better pay. If working long hours and staying longer is what I have to do then, I would not mind it to avoid long commutes. Does this come off as desperate to HR?"
Company blew off my references and finally got back to me 2 months later.,"Over the summer I applied to a pretty large organization -- In 3 weeks time, I interviewed twice, produced a work sample and submitted, upon their request, my references. The department person I was in contact with called all my references and left voicemails. All my references called this person back, in one case twice, and left him voicemails, yet none of them ever heard from him after that. 

Two months later I get a letter in the mail saying I wasn't selected.  I'm a little bummed but mostly miffed because of how my references were blown off.

The HR contact who coordinated my interviews was very nice in my interactions with her. I want to email her, thank her for the opportunity and ask what I could have done to improve my application....but how do I mention my curiosity about the reference situation? I can't help but think the department dude dropped the ball and tanked my candidacy.   


Thanks all!"
"Constantly Rejected, Really Low Self-Esteem","I currently work at Wendy's 32-39 hrs/week for $9.15/hr. I also worked at Radio Shack when they were open from 2016-2017.

Have you ever responded to a rejection email?,"Has anything good ever come out of responding to a rejection email? I've heard of someone being later hired for a different position after being rejected for one, but I can't find the post.

I've only responded to one that said they liked my experience and might consider me for a different and more suitable position, since the original position turned out to be different than my goals."
"Did I make a mistake in communicating with this prospective employer who seemed interested in me, or was I just unlucky?","Hi all, first-time poster here.

I graduated in May with a degree in Music Technology and Composition, and began applying to jobs about a month ago after a busy summer. I came across a posting from a UK-based company for a freelance audio producer position in New York, which is right up my alley in-terms of technical knowledge and work experience. It may be worthwhile to note that while the position is in audio/podcast production, the majority of the company's business is \*not\* in that field.

About two weeks after applying, an employee (I'm not sure of their position) — let's call them Jim for the purposes of this post — contacted me by email with the following message:

>Hello u/iam_hexxed \- thanks for getting in contact, we're getting ready to move forward with this role, I wanted to check what your current availability was. We are potentially looking for someone to work with us in early October.   
>  
>Also could you confirm your day rate: thank you  
>  
>jim lastname

While I do have an existing day rate, I knew that a) it would be well under market for the area and b) that this job was a step up, and that I should ask for more than my current rate. After reaching out to some mentors in my field, as well as the r/audioengineering sub (see post \[here\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how\_do\_you\_set\_your\_day\_rates/](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/d8qedw/how_do_you_set_your_day_rates/))), several people I asked said that a key piece of information I needed to know was whether I would be paid via a 1099 as a contractor or as an employee before I could give them a rate. This made sense to me because, while the position had ""freelance"" in the title, it also listed several benefits that would only be given to employees (IRA contributions, etc.), so I didn't feel that I could infer the answer. Mentors and members of the audio engineers' sub also encouraged me to ask whether I would at any point be using my own equipment, which merits a higher rate for maintenance etc. So, early that same evening, I replied:

>Mr. Lastname,  
>  
>It's great to hear from you!  
>  
>I'm shortly relocating to New York from \[nearby city\], and with that slated my calendar is wide open — early October definitely works. As far as the rate goes, that depends upon whether or not I would be considered an independent contractor on a 1099. Can you clarify that? In addition, please let me know whether or how often I would be expected to use my own equipment?   
>  
>Thanks very much,  
>  
>u/iam_hexxd

The next day, which was a Wednesday, around 12 noon:

>u/iam_hexxd \- to be honest, I dont know the answers to your questions, I'm afraid but i'd be happy to set you up on a call with one of the producers here so he can explain it in more detail. ​  
>  
>in the meantime I'll look into how you will be paid.   
>  
>would you be free for a call at 3pm Uk time which I think is your 10am

You'll notice that this message arrived in my inbox \*after\* the suggested call time based on the timestamp, so this wasn't possible. Still, I felt excited because they seemed interested in me. I replied about an hour after receiving the message:

>Hi Jim,That's no problem at all! I appreciate your honesty on that. Unfortunately, it looks like for some reason this message didn't reach my inbox until well after 10 am EST. I'm traveling tomorrow, so do you think we could arrange a call for some time on Friday?Many thanks,u/iam_hexxd

I received no reply until today, which was six days later:

>Hi u/iam_hexxd,  
>  
>We’re just writing to you to let you know we’ve reviewed your application for the ... position and unfortunately, it has not been successful this time.  
>  
>We really appreciate you taking the time to apply and please be assured your application was reviewed and given full consideration.  
>  
>Thanks for your interest in \[company name\].  
>  
>Kind regards,  
>  
>jim lastname

My question is, did I make some mistake in the process of communicating with this employer that might have upset them and caused them to pick a different candidate? Perhaps I'm naïve, but it seems as though they were interested with a back and forth happening, and then they suddenly went silent, five days went by and I got passed over. I'm pretty bummed because it feels like in following the advice of mentors (one of them said to me ""you should definitely ask if it's a 1099 before giving a rate""), I lost out on a good job opportunity which has been hard to come by so far.

TL;DR: not sure if something in my emails (see above) with a prospective employer for a freelance audio production job caused them to change their mind about my candidacy.

Note: I have changed some details to protect my privacy and the company's, but they have been changed to accurately reflect the situation (i.e. where the employer did not capitalize their name, I did not, and I removed my current town for privacy reasons)

Thanks in advance!"
"I didn’t get the job, but I got something better than a denial email","I had applied to 2 jobs from a site that didn’t have thousands of listings (which may be the reason) but like most applications, I didn’t expect to hear back except to schedule a call. Well, today I got an email from one of those companies which explained they had decided to pursue other candidates but to thank me, they gave me a $50 credit to order from their site.  How cool is that?!? They make custom items and were sure to mention that the $50 would cover an order. What a great way to lessen the sting while also potentially gaining a customer?"
Feeling So Defeated from Job Search,"I've been searching for my next job full-time since early June, and I am feeling so defeated lately. 

&#x200B;

I got some early movement when I contacted some LinkedIn connections I had previously worked with, but even with those recommendations I was not offered a position. I even talked to a VP at my last job to see about returning, and wasn't even given a phone interview despite her singing my praises and trying to connect me with the Director of the division I would have worked in. At this point I've probably had over a dozen phone interviews, and four in-person interviews.

&#x200B;

I don't really understand what's happening. Before this period I took pride in my interviewing skills, I was given offers at almost every place I interviewed at. I'm not sure if it's because I'm now applying for jobs that aren't entry level, or if I'm doing something wrong now. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any ideas for getting motivation and maybe some new traction? I feel like I'm running out of steam, and I'm starting to question my self-worth as a person and a professional."
Job Application Appeal Request: Is it too much to go through each qualification one by one?,"I applied to a state government position that is a great match for my qualifications, and is a position I have great interest in. Most of the Minimum Qualifications were to the effect of ""knowledge of ...,"" ""Communication skills,"" ""Experience with this particular task."" I meet all of them. Furthermore, I meet all of the Preferred, except for one (i.e experience with a particular system).

I have the knowledge (from coursework/BA) and the experience for this position. I always make sure I outline relevant coursework and go into detail when needed.

 I received an email from HR today that said I did not meet the min. quals. I have the ability to appeal, and I'm starting to write the letter. My original idea was to go through each qualification one by one and show how I meet each. However, I don't want this to be overkill. I also don't want to come off as hostile by starting each paragraph with ""To the # qualification...""

I'm fairly certain that my application got lost in ATS, or my coursework didn't pass as ""knowledge"" with HR."
Can my job make me kill a Mouse/Spider/Etc,"I work in a restaurant and the other day there was a mouse in the kitchen. I was told by my boss to kill it, even though i was able to get it outside with a cup, which i did. But my boss threatened to write me up for not killing it.

I'm asking this because i dont agree with killing animals like that. If im able to get them outside, i will do that. 

I also ask about spiders because i have been told to kill spiders at previous jobs as well. But they never threatened to write me up for not killing it."
Starting a 100 hour work week starting tomorrow- Need tips,"I'm in a situation where I absolutely need the second job right now. The 2nd one I recently got is 10 hour shifts and the original is a typical 8 hours a day. The 1st job I have Mondays and Tuesdays off, and the 2nd has Saturday and Sunday off. So my real struggle days will be Wednesday through Friday because I work both those days and I'll try to make up the lack of sleep on the days I'm just working one job.

My first job is flexible so I could try doing something like 6 hour days and/or 4 days a week to help a bit. I'd still have 80+ hours. I have to do this because my transportation situation right now is crap and I don't have reliable people to take me to work. Uber/lyft everyday is expensive so if I just work one job I'll literally have no way to ever save for a car. I thought I would have a roommate so I wouldn't have to do this but they flaked out on me.

Also they're both the ""physically demanding"" type of jobs but I'm used to that by now. The main thing I'll be doing is fighting my sleepiness. I also posted in r/productivity but only got one response so far from someone who clearly only read the title."
"I no called no showed, 3 times.","So during the week, t-mobile got attacked with a DDOS, I had no means of being able to call in to work, while my mother was sick with what looked like COVID-19, but I guess it wasn't because she's magically recovered within 3 to 4 days. The no call no shows were not consecutive, and no one at work seemed to even bother to ask where I was or anything, so in my head, you know, no big deal I guess.
I ended up doing this once more, recently, because I am stupid and I overslept. My department manager said this wasn't good and he would have a meeting with me the next time I worked.

With situations like these, wouldn't you usually just be fired on the spot?

 Thoughts? I don't want to lose my job, and I know it was really dumb of me, but the job seemed to be so laid back, and I should have known better."
Employee who is horrible at work,"So all I have an employee who just started work very recently and she came to me a week after starting, and let me know that the schedule that I provided for her will not work. I explained to her that “you are currently in training and I want to make sure you are comfortable with the basics before I start making big changes to the schedule for you.” She replies, “well my boyfriend is the only one with a car and he works a different schedule so YOU NEED to change my schedule.” I explained to her the same thing about training and she gets upset and leave. Next day she came to work on her scheduled time and I just asked her the simple question “how is your day going?” She replies with a “you are my boss, I have my boyfriend to talk to” A few days later she shows up to work late by 25 minutes and I gave her the freedom to make up her 25 minutes  the same day or another day and she says “well I can’t do it because of my ride”. I forgot to even mention she is only a part time employee who works 17 hours a week. I’m currently weighing my options because now it looks like I made the wrong decision to hire her.

"My department restructured and I lost all higher level responsibilities, what should I feel?","How do I interpret the following situation professionally?

Situation:
I work as an engineer in a small development department, up until recently my manager has placed me in a leadership position with talk of increased responsibilities.  I have been running customer teleconferences, driving the largest and most complex project open and have rewritten and redesigned a vast majority of our internal documentation, and trained most of the other employees all within my own drive.

Recently an internal  position for a sub manager was opened.  I applied and didnt get it, which is fine.  Instead  the position was split into two positions, and all of my higher level responsibilities were given to one of the sub managers, including the project I have been driving for two years.  Both hires were from our own small department and had the same title I do. 

My manager has done nothing to create a transition period, given me any feedback of my efforts up to this point, or any reassurance that this isnt a titleless demotion. I just showed up to work and all my usual responsibilities were no longer mine. 

I'm pretty crestfallen.  Leading up to this event has felt like a steady push out of any responsibilities I try for.  I have had meeting requests get denied only to be invited by another employee to the same meeting at the call of my manager, ideas vehemently rejected only to be later dictated out by my manager as his own.  He has a favorite employee with substantially less experience than me that he spends every day talking to about everything in the department.  Even while I was running projects he would never check up on them or talk to me about them.  

TLDR:  
An internal restructure leaves me feeling shafted. How do I interpret these events? Am I just jealous? Am I being a baby about this? Or am I just a victim of shitty management.  I feel like I deserve at least the courtesy of some kind of reassurance from management. Am I right in this? Unless this is a covert slap in the face."
Any tips on how to not forget to clock out? I've done it twice in two weeks!,"Hi

"How do I get over being fired, even when it’s been a year or two?","I don’t understand why I am still really bitter and angry about this.

But I am still bitter about it, I feel stupid that I feel angry but I just can’t forget how insincere the goodbye was. I still feel the rejection of it. I want to get over this but the feelings won’t go away. 

This makes no sense since I got another job soon after and did really well at it, and just recently left it because I have to return to school. But my performance was very good and experience good, and I left on my own terms. 

So even with this success I still feel bitter as hell about being fired issue that’s from two years ago. Any tips on how to get over it. I feel stupid but still so angry about it"

Life With Company After PIP,"Note: I also posted this in AskHR but would love to hear other perspectives as well if anyone has gone through something similar. 

I'm located in Maryland; however, my company operates out of Washington DC. Some context but a general question at the bottom.

In late January of this year, I was placed on a 90-day PIP related to project timeliness and communication. At the time, I had been extremely sick for several weeks and had requested time off, which had been denied. I missed a deadline and a few days later was placed on the PIP. At the time, I was convinced it was a cover-their-butt, I'm getting fired move and started looking for new work - although I'd never had a performance issue or negative appraisal in the past, my supervisor and I don't work well together (she's an extreme micromanager and I've tried talking to her about how I perform better when I have some flexibility in process, but this hasn't changed anything except me just needing to adapt. I'm also her only employee, so I have almost no autonomy in my work, which isn't the norm for my position in other departments).

But after 90 days (late April), I ended up passing my PIP and was formally removed from it, with the feedback that I excelled at the goals set and to continue the good work. This was a huge relief - since COVID hit, I hadn't had any luck finding other opportunities.

In late May, our company advertised they were looking to fill about 10 positions from internal applicants for a new department - some would be a promotion, others would be lateral transfers. I've worked well with the hiring manager on other projects in the past and my skills matched really well to what they were looking for, so I applied. The interview with her went well and I was brought in for another meeting about it this week. I was incredibly excited - I love my company but there's no room for growth in my department (my supervisor keeps pushing back her retirement), and I want to be able to stay and grow under a new supervisor so badly.

However, I was told that I wouldn't be transferred or promoted at the meeting. Our HR rep was there, which I thought was strange. The hiring manager asked if I wanted feedback on why I wasn't selected, and I told her yes - that's when the HR rep stated that due to my performance in my current role, it's unlikely that I would be approved any transfers for ""some time,"" and that internal promotions would be ""very unlikely at any point.""

I feel devastated. I understand their hesitancy - on paper, there's no context around what happened earlier this year. But the tone seemed to be that I would never have opportunities internally because of this. I'm curious what bearing successfully completed PIPs have on internal hiring decisions in general, and if I should resume my external job search? Thank you for your time and thoughts."

Help for measurable PIP objectives for ‘subjective’ performance?,"Advice and examples for drafting up a PIP for ‘hard to measure’ objectives? 

Eg -, autonomy, accountability, decision making and problem solving?


I really want to help this person to perform and nothing I am doing is working so far. They seem to not understand the basic elements of their role, and can’t do things without a lot of micro management and hand holding. This is hindering their own progress and despite coaching I can’t get them out of this mindset. HR have asked for a PIP and I haven’t done one before. HR agreed it’s tricky because it’s not the output of their role, it’s about their performance level required enact the role . 


They are completing the outputs asked so I can’t base it on that. It’s just that output is low because of their behavior. E,g  primarily it’s the amount of documentation and hand holding that’s showing they are not performing at a level required. (Need ‘how to ‘ documents for basic tasks, are asking me to make decisions for them consistently despite various coaching, and also behaving in a negative manner when interacting with others or receiving feedback)


However I don’t know how to phrase that in a PIP?

How can you show/ give the opportunity for them to improve on what seems to be intangible outcomes?

Ideas for actions they can take and ways to measure improvement? 

Any examples desperately needed."
How can I learn or become more assertive?,"Hi friends! A little background about me.. I am a 20F that works at a daycare as the administrative assistant. I handle all of the calls, scheduling, paperwork etc.. I am an extremely nice person and hate to give people a hard time. Long story short, I have this one lady that likes to test me being admin. I feel as though she doesn’t take me serious because of my age. Because of this, things have been slipping &I need to handle it. How can I become more assertive? I am a naturally shy person but with my career field (Business with a focus in healthcare) I NEED to know how to speak up🤦🏽‍♀️ please help. I am willing to look at YouTube videos, trainings, anything."
"Im currently in retail and the person i close with is smoking in the bathroom, always late, and never helps me out and makes me do all the work...Advice ?","So im currently working in retail and theres this person whom i close with. 

She never cleans the place up, shes in the bathroom for 20’ at a time, she smokes when everyone has left except us two, shes always late to work, and spends an extra 20’ on lunch...

Im about to leave this job and go to a new one so i dont really care but i dont want this to be something that someone else in the future has to go through. How can i tell me GM about the situation? I dont wanna rat her out but ik for a fact, that if someone were to close with her, he or she will hate it."
Concerned about supervisor behavior/disrespect,"Let me start by saying I like my current new job, I am a few weeks into a new position as an admin assistant. Myself and the other admin. assistant who herself has been here a few years, work together everyday and she was telling me a story which rubbed me the wrong way. Let me preface this story by stating that the building we work in requires us to escort individuals who do not have access badges. As a result, when the cleaning crew comes in each morning we are required to follow them around until they are done for security purposes.

She told me that once when she was newer, the bell rang at the front door and she left the cleaning ladies for a quick minute to let the person at the front in - mind you, the cleaning crew was still in her line of sight so it shouldn't have been an issue. The supervisor witnessed this and when she told him why she left the ladies for a quick second he yelled at her quite loudly in front of a multitude of high-ranking employees and said ""WHY WOULDN'T YOU TAKE THEM WITH YOU TO THE DOOR? USE YOUR HEAD, USE YOUR HEAD!"" \*while pointing to his head aggressively\*  My co-worker is soft-natured and this affected her so she went to him later in his office and confronted him about him trying to act like a big shot in front of the higher employees by disrespecting her and that it would have been better for him to have told her about her mistake privately. He apologized and it was over.

Or so I thought.

I keep hearing small anecdotes from her here and there about how he chewed out the last girl in my position when she would make a small mistake and how he's chewed others out. I guess what I am trying to ask is, what is the best way to handle such situations? If that had happened to you what would you have done? In my opinion, he seems insecure as he makes me do more of the technical work on Microsoft office since he is an older fellow (mid-50's) but, does not admit that he does not know how to do it. Instead, he acts like I ""helped"" him out due to his ""high work load"". He also acts differently when the government employees are present since we're contractors. How does one handle someone who could potentially be demeaning and rude at work? I do like my job but, I want to avoid being embarrassed publically.

Let me add to this: Yes, he is my direct supervisor but, the project manager is the boss for both of us and is much more professional in nature. "
Can you be fired for a customer exaggerating events because they're upset?,"I work at a small store in my town, I have been sniffling and itching my nose with my shoulder because of all the health and safety measures going around, I use hand sanitizer liberally and regularly because I'm a main cashier and can't go to wash my hands on a regular basis and I can't call off work over a allergies.  


An elderly woman I was waiting on got angry when I sniffled and said ""Aren't you required to wear a mask?"" and I told her no I wasn't, then I reached my arm up to itch my nose and she got even further upset that I did that while continuing her order.   


I got a call today on my day off from one of my managers that she had called to complain that, and I quote, ""Used my sleeve to blow my nose and I had snot on my sleeve"" and that she was wanting the district manager involved, which he is now. And my manager asked my side of the story which I explained to her and she said she'd relay to him.   


Can I be fired due to this woman's false accusation? What do I have at my disposal to fight her accusation? What tools do I have to fight being fired wrongly if she does get me fired?"
What do about tedious job routines? Any data entry workers here are welcome to provide tips or advice.,"Hello everyone, little back story, I studied marketing and have my bachelors degree, found a Data Entry job (37.5 hours weekly, no benefits) through a staffing agency after searching for a full time job for months after college, and now I am on my 6th month working here. I originally planned to use this job as a stepping stone to move on to something greater after getting experience here for about a year. I have a side gig of my own online business in ebay which consistently makes a little under minimum wage. Luckily I am not in any financial situations at the moment. I have previous experience in customer service, online ebay selling, and a temporary office gig.

After working at this data entry position full time, I am starting to feel stressed and not as satisfied working here. However, some of these issues are my fault from typo mistakes, language barrier, and already showing sensitivity to the higher position employees. If it makes a difference to some, this is a Japanese office and I am a mixed Japanese American, speaking elementary Japanese while my employees all speak fluently with understandable English and are from Japan which means work culture is very different here. I mainly got this job to fill in my unemployment gap, have better income, and gain experience. 

I have recently gotten the notice to fix my problems that recently happened (accidentely sent wrong report to branch and incorrectly entering shipment number a few times) and I feel that it is hard to ask questions if unsure about something, maybe I have terrible judgement or decision skills. I am not the smartest individual but I do not perform well if mistakes pile up. I am doing my best to not let these happen again but part of me thinks something else may come up and bite me later on. I have thought about what I did and have my notes to refer to, I am great at getting things done, I am very friendly in the work environment. Sometimes I feel that I do not get the same treatment as others if a mistake is made since I am not a Japanese employee, I get anxiety thinking about these small typos, email accidents, or anything the higher ups may think of me. I feel like I might want to quit soon or consider looking for a different job that may fit my background or be more better for my resume experience that works with my degree, but for obvious reasons, it doesn't look like there are possibilities of interviews or much employment due to the Covid virus. I am currently working from home so it lessens the pressure of demandant or harsh attitude from the higher ups. I am able to talk comfortably, get amazing support, and guidance with the younger and same positioned employees as myself since I have the least experience there. 

I understand data entry isn't that hard of a position from third party perspectives but it can get tedious, stressful, and exhausting at times. I am currently willing to double check more often, refer to my notes, and refrain from asking the group chat too much to not draw any attention to a small mistake since the higher ups will overreact to it and get mad. If anyone has some advice for minimizing error or working in data entry, please provide helpful advice for me. Any advice on quitting or value of this job expeeience? Thank you very much in advance. Glad I got these thoughts out since its 3am and I can't sleep cause I've been thinking about it too much while I have to be awake by 8:15am."
Burnout for my role has left me crippled and almost 0% productivity available. Help.,"So, a question.

I work for a certain company in the logistics industry, and the amount of workload has just increased. For a company that's been in the industry for about a decade or two, it still runs like a startup, and I was recently inducted into a role after the previous handler of 4 years left the company.

Practically 0% documentation was left to me about the process; there were some instructions given to me when I asked about them, but those don't encompass the entirety of the job role, and I am now left to rediscover them again.

Manager has given me this role because the person was leaving then and nobody was more capable than me at that point, but right now, I'm believing anyone would be more capable than I would.

How do you rebound from this, as I get anxiety attacks thinking about what mistake I will inevitably make, and facing them requires me to build up a lot of willpower that's already burnt out, and ends with me not being able to do everything that I should have been able to.

The increased workload back on my previous role was painful, but manageable as I knew the process. This time, I've been hit with the Peter Principle, incompetent and paralyzed."
How to balance workload in having 2 full time jobs?,"Hey guys. So to give you a short background, I [22M]  am a full time developer for a local company in our city however due to the virus we were forced to stay at home and we aren't paid which is understandable.  However when the community quarantine is done we can go back to our company. 

Now it's been a month and we don't have any idea until when this quarantine is. Because I'm the breadwinner for my family, I searched for remote jobs and I recently got hired for a remote position. The new company I work in is aware that I am also a full time developer is my place.

Now what I am kinda concerned is maybe I might get overwhelmed with the tasks of the 2 jobs I have after the quarantine. Do you have any advice as to how I can be able to successfully finish future projects/tasks of my 2 jobs? Asking for advice from people with similar experience. Thank you!"
Is it ok to call off/go home sick for anxiety or mentally not feeling well?,"So I have mild anxiety and I work as a cashier as a store that sells groceries in a small town, and with this pandemic my job is going so roughly that I’ve been nervous, anxious, jittery and the other day I felt like I’d pass out after only 2 hours of work. 

I only work 12 hours a week on average and I wanted to know that if this feeling gets any worse, if I can call off or go home sick due to it? 

Or is it heavily frowned upon or get me fired immediately? 

Prior to this pandemic, I was fine and doing well, but everything has been so hectic."
What I learned from getting laid off from a basic administrative assistant job,"I (26F) recently got terminated without cause from my former job as an Administrative Assistant at a student organization. It was a nice environment to work in, in the beginning (I started this past April). Then eventually I found myself unable to put up with the menial tasks, the below average salary, and the fact that there was no opportunity for growth/advancement in this tiny organization of 4 full-time staff members (including me).

So since July 2019, I had been looking for another job. I must have submitted at least 70 applications since July, for roles related to administration. I gladly used my sick leave hours and personal leave hours to go to job interviews. However, I kept on getting turned down. 

Shortly after, my work ethic at my current job was slipping. It wasn't even a difficult job but I mentally left it soon after I started searching for other jobs. There was/is a bit of egotism in me as well; I thought that I was capable of landing a better job than this admin assistant role, that I didn't go through five years of university just to be assisting others with no sense of agency. 

I thought I could keep working there while secretly applying to other places because I was friendly, cheerful, nice. I thought personality was still important. 

Obviously I was wrong; results matter infinitely more in the workplace. I was called into my manager's office and was told that they have decided to terminate me without cause, effective on the same day. They gave me severance plus vacation pay, on top of  two more weeks of regular pay. I didn't even care about that anymore. I packed my stuff and left that office in a daze, half an hour later. 

The next five days were the lowest I had ever felt in my life. I went to speak to a counsellor for the first time in at least eight years. I sent out ten resumes a day so I don't go crazy. I thought I finally had actual depression because I no longer had any appetite.

On the sixth day after my termination, while I was essentially sulking on the bus on my way to the library to send more resumes, I received an unexpected phone call from a director from the last interview I went to, before I was terminated from my old job. He said they've decided to offer me the position of Academic Advising Student Support. Out of all the jobs that I had applied for, this was the one I wanted the most. 

I was nearly in tears because I no longer had any expectations of life turning out for the better.  I don't have connections and I don't go out of my way to network — I am on my own when it comes to finding a job, so this news really turned my life around again. I start on December 16th. 

I have thought things would have been even better if the phone call came BEFORE my termination day, so I could have resigned instead of being terminated. I could have beat my former manager to it, in a sense, and not have to feel so ashamed.

But as masochistic as it sounds, I deserved some emotional pain. Otherwise I wouldn't have learned my lesson as much —which is that results trump personality in the workplace, and also do not let your job searching affect your current job in any way! It hurts to lose all your old colleagues just like that. 

I hope anyone reading this can relate and weigh in if they have experienced similar sentiment. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your heartfelt comments!"
How to fix my attitude about work?,"I recall a conversation with a software engineer consultant at my job about feeling ownership of your work. I said to him it must feel different to be an independent contractor than being a full time employee for another company because as an independent contractor you then take true ownership of your work. How well you do is directly applied to your name. I thought at the time that whatever I did as a full time employee was all just under the name of the company I’m employed by. He said to me that that’s actually not how you should think about work and I think he meant to show me that as an employee anywhere you need to feel like you are responsible for your work alone and that it always directly reflects on you and your work ethic whether you are a independent contractor or or a full time employee. 

I realize that he was right and thinking about that has made me realize that I may have been doing things wrong all the time. I don’t get much feedback on my performance right now and I think that may be why I just assume that it doesn’t really matter. I don’t have that burning desire everyday to impress, that’s one of the things I want to change, switching from having to work hard to impress my superiors to working hard for myself. 

I feel like I am essentially “hiding” behind my superiors at this company. Letting them dictate what I do on projects, but they are quite independent workers themselves. So how do I change from this mindset of “oh this company is a little slow, so I’ll just fall in line” to “I am my own damn person and I’m going to go get whatever I want in this world!”?"
"How bad is it to get a ""verbal discipline""?","They've either just implemented them at my new-ish job or they're doubling down on giving them out. Or they just didn't talk about them before. How bad is it to get a verbal discipline? I've not gotten one, but I'm curious. What is it? What does it mean to get one? There is some information online, but it's not overly informative. How common of a practice is this at other companies? I've not heard of it at my other jobs, but admittedly, I don't have much experience in the labor force."
300 Job Applications Down And I’ve Finally Landed My First Job!,"I don’t know who needs to hear this but here‘s a reminder to keep going if you’re job searching. This past year has been the toughest of my life and I have faced rejections from over 200 companies, the majority of which never even had the decency to get back to me. As I sent off my 300th job application, I wondered how long it would be before I was employed. As I was thinking that exact thought, a leading multinational company got back to me and offered me a job I had interviewed for.

The job search is brutal - companies are really shitty and it takes a lot to keep pushing through the rejections. My advice as someone who has finally made it through it all is to KEEP GOING. Your break is coming. Out of 300 job applications, one company saw something in me. If it’s attainable (which it is), it’s all a matter of time and effort to make it happen so keep going. You owe it to yourself."
Should I take a job that is fully remote?,"Hey!

As the title suggest I got offered a job that is 100% remote.

There would be gatherings for industry events a couple times throughout the year but apart from that it is a senior marketing manager position in which the whole company is spreadout over the globe. 

The pay is better than my current one but the job itself includes more responsibilities as for which a non-remote job in my area I would land at least 20-30% more income
The contract is limited to a 12 month period for now. 

What are your experiences with remote work, especially a job that is 100% from home?"
Can my boss leave me off the schedule?(california),"I dont know if this is the right place for this question but I'm having a little bit of an issue with my manager. I wont go into it because it's a lot but this is the latest thing.

I work in California at a Domino's. We get week by week Monday-Sunday schedules. There was no discipline or reason to be left off of the schedule, she just didnt schedule me. Isnt the law in California that if you are available you have to recieve at least 2 hours?

Thank you for the help!"
So My Boss Yelled At Me Today,"Tl;dr - I asked my boss something I was unsure of and got yelled at in front of many people at the restaurant.

So my boss has a good history with me. My mom knows the boss well, I've been friends with his daughter for 10 years now, etc. Problem is, he sometimes uses my problem with gullible (As I'm still relatively new to the job (5 months or so)) to sometimes make a joke and ""humiliate"" me in front of my coworkers. 

It's all for a good laugh and I completely understand.

However, he sometimes asks me to do things that makes me second guess myself (as if he was taking advantage of me being gullible). For instance, he one time asked me to pour beer into an udon togo container for him and set it aside next to him. I hesitated for 3 minutes and was unsure of what to do, but followed through and poured it in. I gave it to him and he started to drink out of it. Strange to me, I thought. He said thanks and didn't say anything after that. 

Now comes, well, today. I am still new so I haven't fully learned everything about how the food is served, etc. I was not busy atm and he asked me to bring these two dishes to my coworkers table, as she was busy helping another table (I'm just a busboy, so you know). I saw that one of the sushi roll pieces had fallen over. I pointed it out to him and he looked at me all confused. I pointed it out again just in case he didn't hear and he said it was ""on purpose"". 

To me, this sounds like another one of those situations where he tried to take advantage of me being gullible. Turns out, it wasn't. 

I pointed it out one last time because I thought he was joking, but that was enough for my boss. He yelled at me saying that it's on purpose because the two sushi rolls looked too much alike. I understood why and said ok. 

No one had ever taught me that, that was supposed to be on purpose to differentiate the two. 

Later that night, after many of the customers left, he told me that he yelled at me because he ""didn't get to smoke for hours"" and ""it's hard working"". He also said it was in the heat of the moment. It was busy at the restaurant. I just said ok as I didn't want to further any anger out of him.

I feel angry and frustrated at myself and at my boss. I was either going to go against my thinking or go against my boss. I couldn't pick the latter, obviously. 

What the hell should I have done? 

Anyways, thanks for reading this boring story about a kid who's too gullible."
How to cope with slow work,"I work a job where the work really comes in waves. I have days where I can hardly keep up with the necessities, and days where I’m sitting around doing nothing for hours. I discussed with multiple coworkers and managers and they said more or less, that’s how it is here. We’re allowed to create our own schedule as long as we’re responsive in a reasonable amount of time. No one is concerned if you’re not working as long as you keep up with your responsibilities. I just feel so guilty during the down time that I’m not working during work hours. The pay is good, I enjoy the job, the atmosphere is wonderful, but the guilt of doing non-work things during work hours is hard to get used to. I know I should see it as balancing out for the times I’m working late and overwhelmed but it’s hard for me. I’ve always had jobs that expected me to work nonstop, so the flexibility and variability is hard to get used to. I’m not complaining, but need to find a way to see it where I don’t feel so darn guilty. I always feel like I’m being lazy and going to get in trouble for not working, even though it’s just the way it is.

Any words of advice on handling the guilt? Helpful hints on ways to restructure my mind into getting used to it? Any relatable stories?"
I finally did it! Unemployed for a year and took a risk that will pay off,"I've never posted here before but I want to share my story and hope it might help inspire some of you who went through similar situations or are still in the job hunt.

A little bit of background about me. I graduated in May 2018 with a Bachelors in Economics. During my undergraduate years, I didn't go out much nor did I really pursue any real opportunities. I did not hold a single job but was involved in some of the student clubs so I had that going for me. I spent a lot of my years in my room playing video games (I still do) and really avoided anything that could land me an internship because I was afraid of rejection. As a result, I didn't have a resume up until my junior year and at that point, I still was reluctant to look for things. Time went by fast and before I knew it, I was a senior with no internship experience and literally zero job experience in my life. I did have some activities though such as some of the clubs I was in but that was it. Alongside that, my GPA wasn't exactly the best, higher than a 3.0 but not by much.

After graduation, I started applying for jobs. I knew I wanted a job in the financial services or tech industry. Initially, I was a bit delusional and thought I could land a solid job but my expectations quickly faded as weeks went on without a single response back. After a month of applying endlessly, I realized that the job hunt process was tiring and brutal but I pushed on. I used LinkedIn, Indeed, and all sorts of different job boards to apply and look for jobs. I tried to get out at least 10 applications a day before I went back to playing video games and this went on until September of that year where I would get my first interview. Because I had no interview skills, I ended up not making it past the first round. Over the course of next few months, this cycle would repeat where I would send out many applications and maybe 1 would get back to me. Sometimes even after getting back to me, I would get ghosted or not do well on the interviews. This went on for sometime and I started feeling helpless as I had to start paying my loans and did not have the means to do so. The only positive side of all of this was that I was living at home and all the jobs I was applying for was in my city (NYC). Instead of applying for some retail jobs to make some money, I was determined to land something I wanted and kept sending applications out mindlessly.

By this point, roughly 7 months had passed by and I had several interviews but couldn't convert any to an offer. I did start to get pretty good at them but I still didn't know why I wasn't getting anything. I was getting desperate and embarrassed and I eventually looked into my school's one-year MBA program. I was worried because I had loans and my family was in a bad financial situation. However, my parents were very encouraging and after consulting a lot of my friends and family, I decided to pursue it. I saw it as a second chance to take all the opportunities I had missed as an undergrad but I knew I would have to really try for it.

I'm currently a few months in and I graduate from my program in May 2020. I have attended many different career events and have done a lot compared to what I had done as an undergrad. I finally have received an offer a few days ago and it feels like a huge boulder has been lifted off my shoulders. The offer exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more happy with it.

I wanted to share this story because I know how brutal the whole job application can be. The last year had been hell for me but it did teach me a lot about the whole process. In the end, it really can be a numbers game and luck does play a factor. For those who are still out there looking, I want you to know that you're not alone. There will be always be up and downs and it takes a lot to push forward but at the end of the day, you only need to land one job. I know my story isn't unique but I know that some of you can relate and push forward. 

If there's anything you guys want to ask, feel free to shoot me a pm."
How should I deal with my alcoholic manager?,"My manager is an alcoholic and used to come in smelling of alcohol on a daily basis. This has reduced  slightly, however, he takes days off 'sick' frequently or days to sort out his 'taxes'. He always has a stupid excuse.

He barely does anything and is paid more than double what I am on and I basically manage the whole project for him. We've asked him to manage more but he doesn't. He's lazy and barely asks what we do and leaves early every day even when he knows we are busy.

The boss has gave him a couple of bollockings and he improved. However, the boss has left to go travelling and is working remotely so now it's just a small team of 4 including me. He has gotten worse again and has took yesterday and today off to deal with 'paperwork'.

In the past when we've called him we could hear that he was at a bar. I know where he lives and his local bars so I was going to drive over at lunch and have a look to catch him in the act. Is this the right thing to do?


TLDR: Alcoholic manager is off sick frequently, is useless and makes excuses so he can take the day off to go to a bar. Should I go and catch him in the act?"
How to manage anger and frustration in the workplace?,"I work at a tech company that seems to value a friendly workplace and a culture above everything. I don't have a problem with that, but this includes sugar coating a lot of issues at the workplace to avoid hurting anybody's feelings. And that I sometimes have a problem with.

I am a quite straightforward person who can sometimes come off as very blunt (I know it is a weakness on my part). My bluntness is not due to me being mean or rude, but just me wanting to say my piece and resolve issues as fast as possible.

&#x200B;

For example, a few days ago, a support person who was working with one of my customers seemed to be repeatedly emailing the customer asking for the information that they have already provided regarding their issue. I took a problem with this because first, the customer was a prospect evaluating us before making a buying decision. Second, the customer was a large enterprise company with a name logo. So my opinion was that the support not making sure that they have all the information before reaching out to the customer is making us look unorganized and lazy. I wrote an internal note to this person stating this and note verbatim was ""pardon me; I don't think repeatedly asking the customer to send the same information is very productive."" The note was visible to his manager, as well as my manager.

&#x200B;

I was trying to be as cordial as possible, but one of my colleagues pointed out that I might be coming off as hostile and accusatory. My thought process here is that I don't care. What needs to be said should be said. We are all adults here intending to bring revenue into the company, and I don't have time to care about feelings.

&#x200B;

I know I am going wrong somewhere here, and I'd like to know how I can change my way of thinking, and what is the best way to approach situations like this?"
I got into a fight at work.,"   I want to preference my post by saying I don’t advocate violence and outside of this experience I’ve haven’t been in a fight since elementary school. 

  I worked for Chili’s Bar and Grill for close to two years. I was indisputably the best server on the floor. I could take half the restaurant and not be weeded at all!!!! Very dependable worker who RARELY ever called out. I have an outgoing personality and know how to hold a conversation, so my guest and peers loved me!! But...then in 2018 came along the infamous 3 for $10 meal.

  Choose one non alcoholic beverage , a starter , and entrée for just $10!! That’s a great deal for guest, but terrible for servers. Due to plates becoming so low our turnover rate skyrocketed. Next thing I know my GF ( who I worked with at Chili’s ) and I working working most weeks with either 1 day or no days off. 
Now I know ... if I didn’t like it I should’ve dusted off my resumé and got a new job. But then again I have regulars who take good care of me and the social interaction at work was also good , plus the commute was quick. So I chose to power through these tough schedules , being the fact my GM (Older white man , Archie Bunker type ) promised the bartender position once he hires up again. 

  Well months go by , I’m still not a bartender and come to find out my co worker ended up being  promoted. I was happy for her cuz she’s my friend but everyone knew it should’ve been mine, or at least my GF’s . I wanted to talk to my boss about it but I knew he would just give me some bullshit answer. 
He gave me some bullshit answer one day when I pressed him on the fact he should make the servers work schedule because our supervisor who’s assigned to the role was abusing her power. She was scheduling herself and her brother good shifts , making sure they were the first ones out the door everyday. I was beyond frustrated at this point. 

 Fast forward to this passed June . I was first cut on the floor and business is slow. For some reason there’s not host on the floor , even though my District manager is present , but whatever . I see a party of four at the door so I seat them with myself. There’s the mother , her grown son , his GF , and their son. They just returned from the courthouse across the street and seemed upset from whatever may have happened over there. I tried to remain as patient and helpful as possible while serving them cuz it felt like one wrong word could flip them over the edge , especially the Grown Son. Eventually, the GS and his GF leave the restaurant. I was relieved cuz they were taking foreverrrrr to order anything !!! The Mother ended ordering sausages then sending them back because they were pork ....

I send my GM to the table to assist her. While taking their order the GS and the GF return. My GM lets me take it from here and he steps 2 ft away to the bar behind us.  The GF still ordering like she’s never read a menu before feels like I’m not being patient with her and calls my GM over and says “I don’t want his rudeass anymore!”.  And for some reason I chose to respond back saying “ well I don’t wanna serve you guys “. Then I began to walk away . The Grown Son then shouted  “ how bout you shut up you fat Faggot “ ... I was taken back by this. In my 4 years of serving I never had a customer be so disrespectful towards me. 

They’re just words I understand , and I should’ve just walked away like IVE BEEN DOING FOR 2 years now . But I didn’t sadly ... I walked back over to him. He stood up .. and I pushed him before he could hit me first. My GM grabs the guy and someone else grabs me. It lasted all of 20 secs with no one landing any good clean hits. I ended up being fired the next day for throwing the first hit. 

  Despite the negative things about the job , I loved it. And I wish I could go back ironically . So my question is it’s been 7 months now , is it possible to get rehired or maybe work for another Chili’s ? And is my GM at any fault for this , I felt like he allowed us to fight? Thank you guys for reading , and sorry for my writing ability."
"I'll put it bluntly, I'm 26 and have never applied for a job. I have a year until graduation, and I'm not sure where to start if I want to be more professional. I want to work on my appearance, how I talk, and my capacity for applying for jobs in my field (geosciences). What are the first steps?","So I have work experience, just not in my field so much. I have been laying tile for my friend's dad off and on since high school. I have 1 year where I traveled around Australia on my own, working odd jobs along the way (fast food, construction, fruit picking, yard work, digging ditches). I have spent summers and winter breaks usually hanging out with family, but I run their forklifts for their company for a couple weeks while I'm there. I've also done some summer work as a sailboat rigger a few years ago.

&#x200B;

But the problem is I never needed an application or an interview for these jobs. Now I'm applying for things and trying to impress people I don't know, and I don't want my lack of experience in the formal job market to show so much.

&#x200B;

Right now I'm struggling with asking for help. I've met some people at conventions who gave me their card and told me to call them, but I can't seem to find the confidence to follow through. It's the same with my research projects from my professors, I'm afraid to reach out because I don't feel in shape to work with them. I certainly don't want to waste their time or betray their trust if they give me any opportunity. 

&#x200B;

There are a million things I need to work on, but I feel confident in what I've done, and I have a year to bulk up my resume. I'm really trying to get to a level of professionalism before I start sending out hordes of applications. 

&#x200B;

Thanks to any and all replies!"
Do I need to be a people person to work insurance/sales?,"So as with the title, I'm not exactly a huge people person as far as an outgoing, bubbly personality. It's not to say I don't like helping people but I guess in all fairness I'm a very dry/boring person. 

I've been working in retail for the past 6 months since I've graduated and although I don't particularly mind it, I kinda got cucked on any promotions for the next 6 months so I've started to look towards other opportunities. 

Thing is I've never really been able to be openly outgoing when I didn't actually mean it, it more or less just had to feel natural I guess."
Will I get fired (or someone from my team)?,"Some very weird changes are happening to the team, and I'd like some advice as to whether I should be concerned. It's long but will try to keep it as succinct.

1. We are a very small team with a lot of work. We have a middle manager, one big boss, and two junior analysts (one of which is me). I am one year above the junior-most analyst.
2. The junior-most analyst and I had a tense relationship for a year. The junior-most and I started at the same time, so they consistently perceived us as peers and yet consistently received worse assignments than I did. The middle manager and big boss didn't assign the junior-most analyst any work, leaving it up to me to manage them, but the junior-most struggled to take my directions and advice believing that I should not boss them around. The end result often was me being frustrated, and/or doing the work myself. The middle manager is well aware of this problem but refused to engage. The big boss is also aware of the junior-most underperforming (though not the management issue), based on various comments he makes in team meetings.
3. All this while, my relationship with the big boss was really on the upswing. He would call me to thank me for my hard work separately, compliment me on job well done (""I knew it would be just fine since you're handling it""), check in after business trips. He also seemed to become more open and honest with me, about his thoughts and opinions, took me aside to give me individual feedback. The middle manager too would call me to check in on a large project that was going haywire, thank me for job well done.
4. Long story short, the junior-most person launched an informal complaint against me and the middle manager for ""mistreatment"". There's no allegation of protected class discrimination, but the gist of the complaint appears to be that they've been told that they were a bad employee, that because of this they were getting bad work, that their relationship with the big boss deteriorated after a project gone wrong, and that they were told (by me) that there was a ""retaliation"". The management side overseeing HR complaints came to give me a talk on this, at which point I explained I never said any such thing, and the only occasions I can think of where that analyst may have made that conclusion are in the context of advice. If anything, I tried to wrangle some ""good work"" for the analyst but that effort failed because I left for vacation and no one gave the analyst anything. The management side overseeing HR noted ""hm, interesting"" but still encouraged that I may want to consider switching teams \[Edit: to add that there was the ""most complaint"" against me\]. The management side asked what was going on with the middle manager too, at which point I explained that the situation in the team is very toxic for a variety of reasons.
5. The junior-most person later told me about this complaint they filed but also told me, after this follow up, the HR asked her about me at which point they said ""things are better"" with me. The junior-most person confided that they complained about the middle manager too for their mistreatment/yelling/etc. and that they told the HR that the mistreatment did not stop as to the middle manager.
6. Around the same time, the big boss began holding team meetings including the junior-most analyst (used to never be a thing, because junior-most was consistently excluded), where he would make that analyst read out loud instructions for hours, while both the middle management and I were just there listening. The big boss began to be way more explicit about expectations and instructions, in ways he never was before. He also began to split up projects in the most inconvenient and artificial way possible to include the junior-most analyst (only to have the substance filled out by me, or redone by me at a later time). The big boss has also been making passive aggressive comments toward everyone -- especially pointed at the junior-most, insinuating that they were useless, and taking away their existing work and giving them a ""more important and urgent"" project.
7. At the same time, the big boss began to act very formal toward everyone and I sense a little big of anger toward everyone including me. This change is not very dramatic for the other two, but the most dramatic for me, as he used to be pretty casual and friendly toward me. He is formal even in exchanges that are one-on-one with me. He would avoid eye contact with me or engaging me in friendly chat in team lunches, unlike before.
8. The middle manager and I still have the same work, although the team is much slower now, and I'm not hearing from the big boss as much as I used to. The junior-most has no work. The big boss is unusually silent, although perhaps it's because of the holiday season.
9. The middle manager told me that no one had followed up with them regarding HR complaint.

It is clear to me that the big boss has been told. My concern is whether (1) I will be written up/asked to leave, (2) I will be kicked off the team. Why is the big boss acting so distant and holding all kinds of team meetings + breaking up work in such artificial ways? Is the company trying to retain the junior-most? Any thought would be appreciated."
"I’m so effing tired of jobs expecting you to stay late and work off the clock unpaid, then getting upset when you walk in a few minutes late.","Dear boss,

You made it very clear during training that “while it is not required of you to stay late, people who do this job well are going to take that extra time at the end of the day to make sure that they have everything done. They will also answer emails from work and make sure last minute things are done. They will also answer texts and take calls from the people we work with if necessary.” That’s fine. I’ve been doing that. I did all of that, made sure to reply to people when needed, stayed an extra half hour every day, even drove to a different office an hour away even though I wasn’t being paid drive time. I’ve never taken my state mandated 15 minute break. On Monday, you looked at the clock and saw that it was 15 minutes past my scheduled shift and you started asking me questions about reports and I stood there for a few extra minutes telling you what was going on. That was already after you made me come in a half hour early without asking if that was okay. We already work 9 hour days 4 days a week there is no cushion room to stay late.

I’m sorry that I walked in 5 minutes late today because I’m exhausted from working here. I get that that’s still an issue and my fault, and I can accept that. I’ll be sure not to do it again, but I also will be walking out of here at exactly when my shift is over, whether or not things are done.

Thank you

Ps- we have an all-staff meeting at 9:00 and your entire staff just walked out at 8:30 because they’re serving breakfast. I’ll be there at 8:55.

Pps- since people are still reading this, without too many details, my job is to help people get jobs. If someone came up to me with these issues, we would literally three way the department of labor."
I got suspended from work for breaking a company policy. Need some advice for moving forward.,"I work at a restaurant in CA and I got called into the office by my store manager and I talked to HR on the phone. I was told I was going to be put on suspension for now, until they figure out what I did wrong or further ‘investigate’ the situation. I broke a company policy. (I didn’t think it was as serious as it is. I definitely know now that they don’t mess around.) I took a picture of the “backroom” and posted it on social media with a caption that they (corporate) didn’t like. (Its a long story on how they found out it was me. And there’s a lot of inside information that would take way to long to explain.)

I talked to HR and told them “yes, i did take that photo yada yada yada...” (I would never lie to anyone at my job, that would just get me in more trouble) and they told me i was gonna be on work suspension. I seriously am freaking out cuz Ive worked there for a long time and I’m a hard worker and well respected by everyone. I really don’t want to lose my job and my store manager certainly doesn’t want to have to fire me, but the call isn’t on her. Corporate are making the call, my store manager told me she has no say in it or any influence over the decision they make. 

I honestly cant believe how dumb i am to post something so stupid online... it was literally a meme too... what is wrong with me... Im pretty sure im getting fired... like 100%, if corporate is making the decision then yeah...

My question is, what do any of you guys think? Will I get fired for something minor like taking a freaking picture? Any advice or input about my situation? Will I be able to get another job? (thats what Im most worried about.)"
Anxious about starting a new job after a long time not working/long spell of depression,"Tomorrow I start a new job and I'm really scared. I haven't worked in a year and for that year I've been dealing with severe depression. 

It's a pretty menial position, without much real responsibility, just a administrative assistant job at a neurology office. 

I'm worried that I'll screw everything up and get fired or I'll have some kind of episode and start crying in the middle of an office. I haven't had a schedule or responsibility for a long time. I'm scared I won't be able to adapt quickly enough.  I'm still severely depressed and worried my symptoms will get in the way of work. 

What can I do to calm down and prepare myself for tomorrow?"
(Probably) Fired for Lateness,"Title. I’m a college senior studying Education, and next year I do my student teaching and will start applying for jobs. At the job I’m currently at, I work as a support staff for people with disabilities. 

I’ve been showing up late by about 5-10 minutes, and was told that on Monday I’ll be getting called into the manager’s office. This is the third job I’ve ever had, I’ve never been fired from my other two jobs: Cashier at Safeway (left after 1.5 years because of management) and Cashier at Winco (left after 1 year for better pay at current job). I’ve been at this job since September 2018 and was intending to stay until June 2021 when I’m done with student teaching. 

So how is me (potentially) getting fired going to impact me? I know I need to fix my absenteeism issues, I just don’t want this to follow me for the rest of my life. And I can’t just leave the job off my resume since I’ve been here for so long."
How should I respond to HR about issues in my personnel file?,"I've been on the job hunt for a while and decided to look at my personnel file's from previous employers. Seems like it would be a smart approach considering one gave me a bad reference. Anyway, there's one employer in particular that is prepping my documents to send over. When I asked them if they would be my contact person if there are any issues with the file. They asked me ""Are you anticipating any?"" I don't know how to respond to this."
Applying for Communications Coordinator position. I need two writing samples. Suggestions?,"To be upfront, my undergraduate background is in a science discipline. This position is associated with a catholic congregation that my high school was affiliated with. In that sense, I know some of the brothers belonging to the congregation and I am familiar with their ministry.

Now I currently work as GIS analyst but I use my free time to read and write. I have no doubt that I could write something up. But i'd like to see if anyone would have suggestions for prompts for these two writing samples. Preferably someone who works in a similar position."
"Attitude to work, blue collar and white collar jobs","I come from an ex-mining town in the UK, in my late 20s and recently started work as a Surgical Sales Account Manager.

Out of my group of friends I'm one of the only ones who has a 'white collar job' working in sales, rather than going into a manual labour role straight from school with family members/friends.

Acustome to tormenting each other in my.group of friends, a common one that comes up is I have an office job compared to their 'hard-working'manual jobs.

I enjoy what I do and have studied and worked hard to get here, but having never been on the other side of the collar I've never experienced what my friends do and how it compares.

With that in mind how do you guys perceive being in a sales position, how does it stack up in terms of 'working hard' in comparison to manual jobs, and why would this be something people bring up to me?"
One of my employees has put his two weeks notice (and changed his mind) four times this summer,"I work for a small to medium sized company and we have about 50 people employed seasonally and then about 20 people year round. We have quite a few teenagers working in the entry level positions. The typical age range for these employees are ages 16-22, with most of them only working summers.

The person I’m talking about is 18. Fresh out of high school and taking a gap year. He’s come to me and explained that he has trouble with anxiety and isn’t sure what to do. He’s asked to stay on throughout the year. I agreed.

This summer after he’s graduated, however, he’s gave me a letter of resignation four times. And each time he’s come back and said he’s changed his mind. I understand anxiety and making quick decisions but I told him it can’t keep happening. The third time he did it and I sat down with him.

He told me that he isn’t sure what he wants to do and thought it was best he put in his resignation, but then he changed his mind. I told him he has to knock it off and if he needs advice, he’s welcome to come to me, but we will find a replacement the next time he does it. 

Today was the fourth time he did it, and he told most of my staff that he was done (before he told me). He gave me his resignation and two weeks notice and I asked him if he was for real this time, and he said 100%,and I said okay, and wished him good luck. 

Not even 3 hours later, he comes back and asks if he can take back his letter of resignation. I’m not sure what to do at this point. He’s a kid, with a whole host of issues. I’ve been there before. A part of me is feeling that he’s doing this all for attention and so people will beg him to stay, then when he doesn’t (or does) get the reaction he wants, he changes his mind.

**UPDATE**

Today at work, he gave his resignation once more. I looked at him like he lost his damn mind. I told him to not bother to show up to his shift and wished him luck in his future endeavors. He looked offended that I wouldn’t allow him to carry out his two weeks but all of the advice I received from this post made me realize how I’ve been a bit of a pushover."
How do you get through a long shift at the most boring job?,"Without getting high. They really stressed this point during training.

I work at a call center and I'm about to go in for my longest shift; 8 hours. I can't bring anything except water or do anything on the computer. I only get a call about every fifteen minutes and I've been told sundays are even slower. My last shift, which was 6 hours, I counted the seconds to see if my pace matched the computer's. Help me."
"Told a co-worker I don’t believe them, can I get in trouble?","Today I had an employee in our production planning department explaining their situation with my employees, this particular production planner seems to have more issues than the rest of the facility. So when this co worker explained her scenario I said “everytime you bring these up I frankly don’t believe you, so I investigate this stuff and it takes me a lot of time to find out the answers which are typically not what you’re stating.”

My position is a logistics supervisor, I’m worried by saying I didn’t believe this person, I was being unethical and can be disciplined..

My co-worker is trying to get me fired.,"I work at the corporate office for a large gym and handle things such as customer service related issues and also schedule times for people to stop into the gym and possibly get memberships set up. There are about 10 people that work in the corporate office and we are all quite good friends.

The way my job works is that us workers at corporate schedule appointments/answer questions for the multiple gyms we have scattered throughout a couple of states. From there, if a potential client decides to go into the gym after we schedule them; it is completely up to the gym workers there. We just get people there and move on. However, there is a certain manager at a gym, let's call him Dan, who has been giving me nothing but a hard time lately.

The first incident was over something that wasn't at all my fault. Dan sent out an email to 3  people: My boss (let's call him Ted), my assistant manger (calling him Kyle), and me. This email claimed that I had ""yelled"" and ""cursed out"" an employee at their gym over deleting some of my records. I am not one to yell or even raise my voice, I cry way too easily. I did call over to the gym and ask why my records were disappearing since they were associated with that particular gym, and they weren't able to give me a solid answer as to why. And contrary to Dan's claim, their assistant manager actually yelled at ME, claiming she didn't do anything wrong. My boss talked to me and apologized on behalf of that ridiculous claim I received, saying that he had Kyle talk to Dan about why he accused me of such a thing, and he admitted it was their error since they were tidying up the systems (which is a part of MY job, no theirs). Also me yelling? Well we record ALL of the calls we receive, including the ones from fellow gyms, and the assistant manager who yelled at me got a warning for her behavior towards me.

I thought that was the end of Dan, but today I got yet another email. Addressed to only Ted, Kyle, and I. No one else in my office.

>***""Can we make it clear to (my name) that someone can not come in and set up a pass for their significant other? We need a waiver signed and if they have no intention of joining then we should not book appointments for a spouse to come in and get a ""free 5 day pass"". We book appointments with the intention to join (isn't wanting to pick up some paperwork for her husband to sign an ""intention to join""?), not so anyone can come pick up a pass for a friend or spouse.""***

However, once again, this was a false claim. You CAN book for someone to come in and pick up paperwork for someone at the gym. I asked all of my co-workers and they agreed that they have all done the same and have never gotten scolded for doing so. All they're doing is picking up paperwork for someone to sign ***with the intention to join***; there's nothing in our manual about that, at least nothing that my co-workers or I were made aware of. Maybe there is in the gym rule book, but NOT ours. If there was, I see no reason why Dan would send out yet another email to my boss, assistant manager and I only instead of calling me directly and discussing it. Instead he had to call me out. I don't see his logic behind it, and upon talking to my co-workers, they didn't either and all agreed that he was trying to get me in unnecessary trouble.

My boss didn't talk to me this time about it. He just replied to the email saying ""I'll talk to her"". But now he's out of the office and I don't believe I will be receiving said talking to. I think my boss knows full well what Dan is trying to do here just because he is mad that his previous lie got called out, however it still makes me feel very on edge.

**Edit**: Dan just got reported to HR for harassing one of my corporate co-workers who came into his gym just to work out last night."
Can an employer discipline for social media?,"My coworker is in several Facebook groups made up of installers in our same industry who all work for different companies. We have some products in common, and it has been a good place to find tips and support from other people who have hands-on experience.


He made a post about an issue we have noticed with a product that originates in our company. He asked the group if anyone else had seen the same issue. Within minutes, our manager came and told him to take the post down, because it had caused a ""big uproar"" at corporate. They are talking about disciplinary action because he was ""bad-mouthing"" our products on social media.


Is there a legitimate case for discipline here? I did a Control+F on our employee handbook .pdf and ""social media"" isn't anywhere in there"
Probation period tips?,"I'm starting a new job and I'm very excited but also VERY nervous! I have a three month probation period and I want to leave my best impression so that this job can be a long-term one. What can I do to pass my probation with flying colours?

Sor far I'm thinking this: show up early, take initiative, remain humble, and be myself."
Does economics hold the same value as finance when applying to financial analyst jobs?,"I am currently a junior majoring in economics at CSUSM but debating about switching to Finance but by doing so will set me back a year in my studies. My ultimate goal is to be a financial analyst at a bank like Wells Fargo. 

Any information or opinion is highly appreciated."
"So, I'm sick (throwing up and the work) and being threatened to be written up at work","Alright, so pretty much. I work at a doggy day care and I woke up at 2am throwing up with violent chest pain and throwing up. I immediately texted my store manager and shift manager and got no response from the store manager, but I got a text from the shitty shift manager saying that I'm burdening her with figuring out how to cover a shift with 6 hours of time before my shift. 

I was then told that I was going to be written up because I made the shift manager go through the process of figuring out coverage for me. (My work has two locations and mine has 3 employees including me, stupid I know. So they had to pull someone from the other location) 

Also, written on our schedules it says at the bottom, if you have a medical emergency (I believe a contagious flu is...) Please contact the store manager and the shift manager for us to cover your shift.

"
I'm a depressed $30 a day worker that needs advice.,"This is gonna be a long one so if youre not interested in hearing a Millenial whine and ask dumb questions please move on. 

I'm 23 years old, i work a minimum wage job for 30ish dollars a day. I'm miserable. Ive been blaming the system but I realize that will just end with me hanging from the ceiling fan sooner than later.

First things first, I like hard work. When im at work I work. No talking, no chit chatting, just me and my work. Im the fastest production line worker in the company right now. But my boss sees my quietness as a bad thing, and I have been passed up for raises twice because of it. And my coworkers dislike me, or rather ""are made to feel unwelcome and uncomfortable by my attitude"".

I'm antisocial and anxious, speaking to my coworkers about anything but the task at hand drains me and irritates me. Is it so wrong to devote my shift entirely to my work? Will it really get me nowhere if I can't communicate mindless dribble to my coworkers? This is my main issue, this is what has actually led to me losing jobs in the past.

Second, I want an 8 hour shift. I dont want to work 16 hour days with a trade. I know people see this as whiney and entitled, but I have a family I like to spend time with every day. They make me happy and are the only reason i havent offed myself already. Is it so wrong to show up when your shift starts and leave when it ends? Will i really get nowhere if i dont dedicate my entire day to my job? Is that really what it takes? Is being the best damn worker in the business for exactly 8 hours a day not enough to be successful?

Last, I am bipolar. I get sick a lot. Sometimes i cant even force myself to stand up. And sometimes I call in because if i dont i will be less than useless at work and i know the only thing keeping me employed is how fast I can turn over products and i know if i show up and screw everything up im as good as fired. My boss knows of my condition and ""tolerates"" it. But usually i get snide remarks and unhelpful ""advice"" on how to be less worthless. Calling in hurts the company, i know. But even with medicine it's the only choice I have sometimes. It makes my coworkers hate me even more and hurts my chances of ever moving to full time again. Entitled again, I know. But if anyone has advice in this area, please let me know.

Im lost. I cant get my mind around these things and I'm so close to giving up. If staying at work for 10-16 hours a day is required, and so is being a social butterfly, to be a successful part of society than I think I'm just not cut out for it. If what i do makes me a lazy piece of garbage like my brother tells me, than I'm better off not being here anymore."
Can I be fired for being sick even with a doctor's note?,"Hi all,

I contracted a viral infection and have been very sick for the past week. I work part-time, so I only missed 2 work shifts as a result. I also have a doctor's note to back it up. However, the schedule for two weeks out at my job was posted online and I'm not on it.

I found coverage for both shifts that I missed, and was sent home from one of them by the business owner himself. Am I being fired for being sick? I can't afford to lose this job right now. Can anyone offer advice? Is there anything I can do?"
Difficulty finding a new job while working one.,"Hi. Just wondering if anyone could share some tips/insights about staying motivated to search for a new job while working one?  I have to keep working to keep up my student loan payments.m but I'm really not into my field (Special Ed as a Paraeducator) and need to find something else that pays more. I find staying motivated to search for another job difficult as alot of my time and attention gets sapped up at work ( training to get a promotion) and I have a side buisness I'm trying to do. Just feels like my attention is constantly all over the place and it's hard to focus in on one thing. I'll find a job and start to apply and then just not finish the app often times. Anyway, just looking for guidance. I'm an open mind. I can't quit really unless I was to pay my loans by ridding my savings"
"Fired for small infraction, had no idea I was anywhere near separation.","So many questions. I am still stunned and bewildered.

How should I approach this situation from an HR standpoint for one?"
Is it me or my targets that are insane?,"I’ve just got a new job doing customer service for a company in the UK energy industry. They’re telling me they expect me to send a minimum of 11 emails an hour. That’s just under an email every 5 minutes, not allowing for breaks. I’m currently at between 6-9 an hour and just don’t see anyway of getting to that target. I’m guessing I could not be cut out for this... but is this normal?"
How do you get over feeling like you're getting paid to do nothing?,"I sometimes feel bad about my job.

I'll come in Monday and have nothing or little to do unless emergencies arise. I can call up the clients I have, like I'm supposed to do weekly, but I like to space them out over the week, and that only takes 5-10 minutes each.

Tuesday is the same.

Wednesday-Thursday are usually travel days. Leave at 9, get there at 10. Meet with clients if possible, get paper work completed with them. It doesn't take very long, so I'm done around 12-1, spend 2-3 hours waiting for a flight and then go home.

Friday I just finish up all my paper work around 12 and sit around on Reddit until the week is over.

I get paid 31 dollars an hour to sit around for the majority of my time and it feels like I'm somehow doing something wrong. Maybe it's just that before this, I'd only worked in kitchens."
A good employee is a no-show and won't answer her phone. What should I do?,"I'm a manager of a  small business, a store. We are a little short staffed. Last night, I was called in on my only day off (I hate that, sorry.)  because one of my employees was a no-show. We have a process where if there's no call/no show they get written up and potentially fired. It's a few steps. ( still, we're an At will State and it's in the policy so if corporate decides to, yikes.)

I'm worried. She's one of my best employees. She always is on time, does a good job. I recently gave her a raise and she was excited about that. I worked on Sunday and she switched shifts with me. She said ""Hey, I'll see you tomorrow!"" But then, didn't show up. It's really uncharacteristic. My employee who was working the morning shift texted her, called her and informed me her line had been disconnected. So I tried calling and texting; also disconnected. I emailed her, no response. She has a few longer shifts on Sat/Sun and I'm nervous about it. She hasn't reached out to me at all.

What if something bad happened? How do I approach this? I've had employees skip out but it was usually just because they were being irresponsible, as I said. I just don't want to overstep my boundaries as boss but I'm worried she's hurt or something. What do you think?

Edit: Okay, I called non-emergency and requested a welfare check on her. I hope she's okay and that this is all for nothing. I'll update if anything comes of it.

Edit: I should probably mention she recently broke up with her boyfriend and she told me he was mad about it so that's another factor.

UPDATE: I got home from work. The police haven’t called me back. There’s a staff member at the shop, I told him to stay vigilant. He’s aware of the situation and is just as worried. I looked her up on Facebook and found her profile. It hasn’t been active for months but I still sent a message. Turns out, she lives in a shady part of town. Nothing to report from driving by. It’s like she’s just a ghost. I’m preparing to deal with the possibility that I won’t hear from her again. I have no idea how I’m going to deal with covering her shifts cause I’m on almost 8 days straight of working. Stressed. Some of you have suggested maybe she just skipped town. Seems unlikely but if her boyfriend situation was really bad... who knows? I’m wondering if the police checked on her and it was fine and they just didn’t tell me? Either way, I’m going to reach out to them and try to get an update tomorrow. If she turns up Friday to her shift I’ll be floored and relieved. If she did this just because she “felt like it” I’m going to be disappointed. I doubt it though, she cares.  Thank you for the support guys, I appreciate it. And your kind words. Either way I’m probably going to be hiring.

\---

**FINAL UPDATE:** She got back to me this morning on Facebook and quit over text. She waited until Friday to contact me. Why? Because I called for a Welfare check.  She didn't give me a reason why she skipped work, cut all contact and ghosted me and our staff. But she was mad I sent the cops to do a Welfare check. The police must have done a check and it was fine so they didn't bother calling me back. 

 I woke up to this from her*:* 

*""As a manager you don't send no cops to nobody house you can get me evicted for the fucked up move you just pulled I could've been in jail or out of town somewhere with bad reception I'm taking it personal because you're being unprofessional  now I'll be there to drop off this key y'all did the most ""*

I'm not sure how this is logical, but I guess I don't know her private life. I don't think you can get evicted for a welfare check. Unless she's doing something illegal?  I politely explained that I was worried about her because it was completely out of character for her to be irresponsible. Also, the break up. She was silent for five days. She's was a valuable asset for our store and I'd just given her a raise?  I doubt I'll get a response. I'm a little upset that she doesn't understand why suddenly disappearing would alarm me, the staff. I'm floored. She was with us for three months. Regardless, I hope she does okay out there and I'm happy she is safe and well. At least this didn't end with someone dying, right? I'm disappointed but relieved. I don't think I was unprofessional, just following procedure from email, phone, emergency contact to welfare check. People will notice and care if you're gone. I think it would have been unprofessional if I showed up at her door as her boss. Anyway, thank you for the conversations, support and advise everyone. I appreciate you all."
how do you motivate yourself to write cover letters?,"Hey y'all!

I'm at a low point right now. I've been struggling with some burn out symptoms since I worked on my Master thesis this January, went through a horrible dating experience, moved from a different country to my parents, and now job search is killing the last drops of my motivation. I have been a very fun-loving and life-affirmative person, but lately the job market does not make it easier to find motivation for cover letters.

I tailor every letter to the position, I research about the company and their values, I adress that and I double check it's the right person etc I am writing to. I went to a training for writing letters and she said I write really nicely (German is my native language). But after rejections and no answers (that is the most annoying part) I have zero confidence and motivation to write another cover letter for an institution that does not care how much effort I put into every application and doesn't even consider me as an applicannt. What should I do? Should I write heartless, standardized cover letters? 

I am applying for jobs that suit my profile (e.g. done internships in that area or wrote a thesis in that field etc), it matches my skills etc. So I don't get what their problem is? 

How do you keep up your motivation for writing cover letters? Any tips on how to change my perspective on it? 

Thanks!!"
"Game Dev graduate struggling to practice, stay motivated and find work.","Hi all,

So as the title states I'm a Gave Dev graduate with a BSc with honours at a 2:1 level living in Scotland. I graduated a year ago and felt pretty good. 

Issue is since then I've been working jobs with tiring hours that have me working with customers, one as a receptionist at a holiday park, now working in a bank call centre.

Since then I've never had energy to program, 3D model or do any level design, applying to any tech position scares me and I just feel like I'm getting in my own way. I've felt for a long time that I've managed to get through Uni through flukes but having left that feels stronger than ever before, especially with the companies I've applied to never getting back to me bar one who sent me a test. A test that brought me to tears over not knowing anything about it.

Does anyone have any advice to getting into tech jobs? As well as pushing past your fear and getting back into a pattern of learning more and practicing more? Thanks!"
Am I being paranoid? Is my boss trying to get rid of me?,"I currently work in a private school.  I'm in charge of the Upper School labs.  I teach also teach a basic CS/programming class, a ""computer skills"" class (basically power point, office, online research, etc.) and a mid-level math class (Trig/Pre-Calc).

Recently my boss (the Vice Principal, who's also head of HR) has been acting very strangely by giving me a lot of busy work.  For example, she's asked me to correct the test papers of other teachers (edit for spelling/grammar), asking me to cover 1-2 extra classes per day at no extra pay (covering classes is supposed to be overtime), saying that parents aren't happy with the course content (which of course, I have no freedom to decide), and claiming that I'm not being engaged in the community because I am not registered for extracurriculars/coaching.  On the last point, I did try to sign up for some things, but I was rejected (I was the only person who signed up and got rejected).

They said I will have a probation meeting on Monday Morning (with HR and some of my peers) to decide if I will go on probation.  They claim that if I am put on probation, the probation will last only 30 calendar days (typically it is 60 or 90 days), at which point there will be another hearing to decide if I have passed or not.  I think that this is just a way of getting rid of me, but maybe I'm just being paranoid."
Is a Mutiny at work ever successful?,"I currently work a state government job, and morale is pretty low at work right now because people are stating that the line of communication is awful and affects things such as, Work from Home Days, Pay increases, etc.

I overheard a few coworkers trying to plan a mutiny against the department. My question is are these ever successful? Any experiences if you’ve had a mutiny at work?"
Fired because client complained about my sexuality,"this is mostly a rant post, because it seems there's not much I can do.

so i was fired yesterday from my job because a client complained about my sexuality and the way i express it. I work in the education industry in Hong Kong, where there is no anti-discrimination law for LGBTQ. When I got to work yesterday, I was called to a meeting immediately, in which I was informed that a ""VIP"" parent complained about my sexuality. Apparently this parent somehow got hold of my instagram account (which I use a different name than my real name), and complained about the photos I posted. I concede that there is some ""nudity"" especially in my gay pride photos, but then that is just how i express my sexuality and my self, which doesn't affect my work performance. The HR and Manager informed me that my presence is seriously damaging the company's reputation, so they terminated my contract with immediate notice. They also emphasised that ""it's not about the sexuality, but the photos themselves"", as they consider how I express/perform my body is distinct from my sexuality.

The thing is that they are paying me full compensation, so according to Hong Kong labour laws there is not much I can do, as employer or employee can terminate contract any time if they abide by the Termination conditions of the employment contract. so yeah....."
"28 years old with BA, but no real work experience or skills","This is going to sound long-winded so I'll try to keep it condensed. I'm a 28-year-old guy that's been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. To be perfectly blunt, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

Are there any entry level jobs that are just looking for four-year degrees in any subject? Right now my big priority is to at least start working full time and then figure out what I want to do from that point on."
Is working too efficiently actually a bad thing?,"Hey! I'm a 25 year old at the beginning of my career and I'm starting to feel like working too efficiently is actually a bad thing. Everyday (particularly when I first started this job), I would come into work and feverishly tackle all of my tasks in the most efficient way possible. Eventually, this led to me finishing my tasks way faster than my peers who were doing the same amount of work, but spreading it throughout the whole day by taking breaks, surfing reddit, or staring blankly into space.

Of course, I thought this would lead to greatness, but actually it seems to have caused me trouble. Because I finish earlier, I constantly end up having to take on other people's work and help them. I didn't mind this when people seemed appreciative (or my boss recognized that I was going above and beyond), but now it just seems like I'm expected to do it.

Perhaps the worst part, though, is that I usually leave at 5ish because I've finished everything. My coworkers end up leaving at 6 or later because they still have work that they procrastinated on. Because of this, it looks like they're working harder/longer (especially because my boss seems to value how long you sit at your desk over how much work you actually get done).

I really feel like being efficient hasn't paid off in any way. I'm curious to see if anyone's had a similar experience!"
How do I tell my supervisor that our new hire is incredibly lazy?,"I use the term new hire loosely because he’s been working for us for about 3 months now. I was originally hired as part-time, but most recently converted to full-time. New hire was supposed to take over my old part-time schedule and I needed to train him so he can start on his own tomorrow. The thing is that he he always makes an excuse as to why he can’t work. He’s been doing this ever since he was hired. 

Last night I was supposed to train him. He made up some elaborate excuse about how his uncle is in the hospital (it was almost midnight) and that he needed to leave. I think he’s lying because every time he makes an excuse, he says someone in his family is sick or dying. I have a string of texts that shows him completely changing his excuses at one point, 5 minutes apart. 

The only reason why my supervisor hasn’t been able to find out he’s not working is because I’m saving him and covering his shift. Plus he’s not really paying attention to who clocks in and out. 

New hire also wanted me to come in on my day off tonight to help him train because that’s more convenient for him. I told him I can’t come in, he needs to find someone else to help him. 

I’ve been dealing with this person for so long, how can I tell my supervisor what’s going without coming off as a jerk? I honestly can’t handle dealing with him."
Just got demoted,"To put it simply, I am an auto mechanic by trade.

I got offered a manager in training position in a company. They put me in two problematic stores. One store, when learning policy and such, the person training me looked at my pay stub when I left it out while talking to a customer, and refused from that day forth to train me. I then got transferred to another store to help. When I got to this store, it was BAD. Technicians lying around doing nothing. No safety policy. Doing bad, dangerous work. Since I have gotten there, sales have gone up, usually we meet numbers and bonus, and there is a noticeable improvement in the motivation and the work quality since I started there. 

However, today,my regional manager told me I am not progressing fast enough (I was originally given a time frame of 3 months,but now it is apparently 2 months). He took me out of the MIT program, took away my bonus pay to meet what I originally wanted, but I am expected to do the same work. 

To add to the fire, my other assistant manager transferred without my regional knowing. Now I do not have that extra little bonus but am expected to work six days a week, some days alone. 

I am a bit annoyed that I got demoted especially since I was put in two problem stores. I see that these sort of things (constant transfers and demotions) happen in this region, to the point where customers and technicians have an issue with it. What is your best advice for me?

Tl;dr Got job as a manager in training. Get thrown to the wolves in problematic stores. Regional demotes me and now expects me to do same work but with an extra day cuz someone left. I think it's unfair because the store I'm in frankly sucks."
Anxiety After $500 Mistake,"I've been working for this company for almost a year, it was the first job I found after moving to a new state, and early this week I wasted $500 in product by not shutting a freezer door all the way. I sat down with my boss and signed a notice confirming the mistake and we had a very stern conversation about communication and being thorough when locking up. I haven't had any other problems or mistakes, but I continuously have a sense of dread about being fired. 

Even though I recently turned down their offer to become a manager, as I'm not in a position to take on any extra responsibilities, I'm still being confronted about mistakes other coworkers make, giving me the sense I'm somehow responsible for them not completing something. 


How can I move on from this mistake and not make anymore? My chest feels tight and my breathing gets shallow whenever I think about work because I'm worried about something else being wrong or getting in trouble, even if I wasn't the person working on a project."
Just got warned I’ll get a “talking to” about leaving 15 minutes early the past few days.,"So the vp saw me head to my car early a few days ago as he was was leaving early and apparently he talked to my supervisor about it and that i will be spoken to, but my supervisor said she doesn’t care at all because no one does work that past 15 min of the day. 

I left due to construction on the route home and i already have a 50 mile commute and traffic turns it into 2 hours. 

Can I go in defensive or is it better to kiss ass and apologize?"
Are there days in the office when you’ve done minimal/no work? Have you ever put off work for the entire day too?,"I just started my first full-time job out of college a couple weeks ago and today was the worst I’ve had in terms of completing things and actually just doing work. I allowed myself to watch the majority of the Blasey Ford hearing for several hours and it doesn’t help that my boss is on vacation until tomorrow(she’s a great boss and I like her btw). Other days I’ve been on my phone for an hour or gone web browsing for a while. I feel like shit for being super lazy today and have no idea how commonplace or rare this is in the office. It’s not like I didn’t have things to do, it’s that they didn’t need to be done immediately. Can anyone relate to this, especially in a new job setting? 

EDIT:
Thanks for all the feedback and advice! I work at a super small company (only 6 people!) and I’m the only one with my title which was also just created after the last person left and they shifted the role a little bit. Not to mention that fact that the boss tends to be out of the office a lot of days and nobody really checks up on me so I’m given a lot of leeway. But it’s true, I’m probably not trusted with a lot of stuff yet; I even told them during the interview process that I would be branching out more outside my duties if I could help it. Overall, it’s fairly easy to slip into laziness at this work level so I think I’ll start asking my boss for more stuff starting next week and the week after. "
Co-worker is desperate to look important...,"Hi everyone! 

I'm annoyed with a coworker. 

I have to go to this guy for daily tasks. But he makes it difficult.

Instead of telling me maybe 2 or 3 items to action at a time (do one then move on to the next etc) he wants to do it one at a time.

He then wants to me to come to his desk and have him 'mark' the work as I stand there watching.

He also insists on making go to his desk to request a new task and have him just talk pointleslly showing me things that are not relevant or helpful to the new task.

Rather than just telling me in one sentence or sending me an instant message of the task i.e B1. 19 he wants some sort of scenario to act like he's super senior (I'm new grad this year, he's new grad last year).

What would you do? How should I deal with this issue?"
Why I dislike the corporate world,"Been working 11-12 years in my line of work. It's the kind of work that goes in waves/projects. We have to do the actual work, but also  be organized, book meetings, interview co-workers in other departments, write reports, issue issues, follow-up on them etc.

I have been assigned to a single project under my manager, who I both like and respect. 

Lately it has been so slow due to the delay of our project I have literally nothing to do. Been surfing the net all day. I sit next to my manager BTW.

Yesterday he had to stay home to watch his twins  because of nanny issues, and assigned me nothing. Today I got in an hour early and NOBODY is here except the peons like myself.

&#x200B;

Now I recognize I could reach out to my boss and say I have nothing to do, but I've learned in the corporate world this is a bad idea. Image is important. Drives me nuts I can't just go hang out at home while doing the same work.  


I should admit I have issues taking initiative on my own, but I'm amazing at completing tasks or following instructions, so I tend to freeze up at these times."
"Can a member of upper management use his position to have me disciplined for something his wife told him I did, but was never reported to the company directly?","Today, my store co-manager came to tell me I was being given a discussion point (one step before being formally written up), for an issue that happened about a week and a half ago. He would not tell me who it was giving the complaint as the person didn't want me learning who they are, but apparently I refused to do something for his wife and she said something to him. He's now demanding I be written up, though none of my direct store management want to do anything, but as he's much higher up in the company they have to do *something* to me to appease him.

A little more background: I work in a grocery store in NC, I've been managing all the specialty cheese we sell but am moving to another store to work as a pastry chef. I spent half an afternoon helping out our cake decorator since she was very, very behind on her work and was off that day. A customer had come asking for a slice of a specific cake, as they were all on sale, but I had not seen any of that cake anywhere in our stock, and told her unfortunately we were out. She didn't seem angry or mad in the store and left, apparently to complain at her husband for it. I was told someone looked later on and found one of these cakes, yet our cake decorator kept things such a mess I couldn't find anything I needed to help her with and I haven't dealt with any of these products in almost 6 years. I was only helping because I had a replacement there for the position I was leaving. Also, as I was under an immense amount of stress that day due to a health issue, midterms at school, and having to go to my husband's grandfather's funeral the next day, I won't rule out the possibility that I missed the cake entirely in the back.

My co-manager said he did not agree with this, since first off a discussion point would be the first discipline used instead of going straight to a write up. Secondly he spoke to our HR rep who said that since the woman never reported it to the proper channels it's off the record, and also does not agree with the actions he was wanting taken against me. I believe it not only unfair but horribly unprofessional that someone would use their position to act like a giant spoiled child, basically. I'm wondering if I should speak to HR directly myself, if I would even have a viable claim about this? I'm well known to a lot of management for doing a great job, and as I'm transferring to open a large, new store in 3 weeks I will be seeing a large portion of the company's upper management. I'll have to wonder if this particular one is going to be there and scrutinizing everything I do (I was told he knows who I am, since his wife mentioned me by name).

TL;DR: upper manager pissed off I didn't have a product his wife wanted and is using his position to have me disciplines with a harsher punishment than what is outlined. Is this something I can speak to HR to address?"
Sometimes PIP's are exactly what they say they are.,"Received a PIP a month and a half ago, read comments on this sub, got scared and found a new job, put in my two weeks on Monday. My current job never intended to fire me. 

Now i feel weird leaving a company that actually intended on my performance improving. They put me on a 1 month PIP and it's been 1.5 months since then. I previously posted about receiving a PIP and everyone told me it was the end of my time here so I started looking for jobs. I found one, accepted, and put in my two weeks. Over the course of the month i continued having weekly 1on1's with my manager. She said that things were getting better but i was still making mistakes. This made me pessimistic about the future and sort of spurred my job hunt.  During my meeting with my manager they told me they weren't planning on letting me go and that it's been over a month and while I'm not where they wanted me to be, i showed improvement. 

I'm still glad i was proactive in looking for and receiving an offer, but all things considered, i enjoyed being here and my team. Now i have to start from scratch somewhere else. I know this is very anecdotal, but a PIP doesn't **ALWAYS** mean you're getting fired. I'd recommend trying to keep the line of communication as open as possible. Even though my manager wasn't going to fire me, her comments made me think otherwise.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: Got a PIP and this sub scared me into finding a new job. Now i'm leaving a job that sincerely cared about my improvement. **PIP'S AREN'T ALWAYS THE END.**"
Am I within my rights to leave a shift at the exact finishing time? Please read scenario in description,"If this should be asked somewhere else, please direct me, also not sure if the flair is correct.

I work in the UK, if that's of any importance.

I have a job that involves me working a split shift, one at 5am-8:30am, there are different managers for each shift, this is the only one I have a problem with.

I had a small argument/talk with my manager about this the other day, in basic form it went as follows:

Manager - ""Please can you do jobs x,y,z""

Me - ""I won't get all of that done in five minutes"" 

Manager - ""What's in 5 minutes?""

Me - ""It's half 8 (supposed finishing time) in 5 minutes, I'm going home then.""

Manager - ""We won't be finishing at half 8, we have a responsibility to ensure everything is done, we started later today as well.""

Me - ""Okay, the time is fine, I'll give you another half an hour of my time. However, I was told that my hours would be 5-8:30am and I believe it says this within my contract, overtime is not compulsory also, so I do not have to stay after that time.""

Manager - ""I can't tell if you're being cheeky or not.""

Am I within my rights to leave at 8:30 in a normal scenario, or in this one am I also allowed to leave at 8:30 or should it be 9?"
My manager at my second job is knowingly scheduling me outside my availability and is threatening to write me up,"I'm very frustrated about this entire thing. My manager at my evening job knows that I can only work evenings there and is still scheduling me during the day which overlaps with my day job. I try to get there as soon as I can but I'm always late. 

Yesterday she pulls me aside and tells me that she's scheduling to the store's needs and that I have to work whatever she puts down on my schedule. If I don't then she'll write me up and if it happens again then she'll terminate me. 

Now the big issue I have with this is my original availability that I put down on my application was that I can **only** work evenings. During my interview she never stated that this was a problem. I was never told that it was a problem that I can't work day shifts. This is very ""all of a sudden"" that I need open availability. I assume this sudden change is due to my manager having to manage another store that is currently without a manager so she has not worked at our store in about a month now. But again, I was never told that it was required that my availability be open and she made it clear that me only working closing shifts was fine. That was when I was hired 2 months ago.

The only reason that I did not get into a further altercation with her about my job is because I have another job opportunity elsewhere and I have no issues quitting this job or, if push comes to shove, her firing me. But she has done this with other employees and I'm not certain if I should report this to higher ups for their sake. It's just not fair that we were lead to believe that our availability was fine, when it clearly wasn't and we're getting our jobs threatened because the manager failed to inform us.

I'm not sure how I should go about quitting this job. If I give my 2 weeks notice and she continues to schedule me outside my availability she might just fire me before my last day. I also feel entirely bad for even entertaining the thought of quitting when we're very short staff and our manager is working at another store. If I quit then my other co-workers have to pick up even more slack and I feel awful about it."
I fear taking a gap year in case I do not find work. Any ways of boosting my chances?," 

I want to take a gap year before uni but I think spending a year of education and focusing on something else will be really helpful for my mental health, whilst also teaching me practical skills like budgeting and hopefully stuff relevant in chemical sciences because that is a loose way of describing the bachelors I am applying for.

I currently have my final college year to go until this proposed gap year. As stated my one fear is that I don't find work and ultimately just spend a year doing nothing. I have a part time job as a kitchen porter right now but is there anything else I can do to boost my chances?"
Just a reminder not to let a poor employer/boss hold you down and hold you back.,"My story is I was working for Company A who was a great corporation with great pay and benefits. However, my boss was the worst boss I've ever experienced. Constantly fighting and arguing with employees and putting everyone down. 

Fast forward a year of dealing with that job and struggling my way through it. I interviewed with Company B who has same pay, similar benefits, but a boss that genuinely cares about their employees. Outside of orientation I have been doing on the job training for 2 weeks and am already up to pace with the rest of my peers in my KPIs.

I just want this post to serve as a reminder that even if you are in a difficult environment to believe in yourself and keep marketing yourself and interviewing until a similar or better job comes around because your performance can change significantly enough to get your career trending back in the right direction."
Is your boss allowed to read personal notes you've written to yourself on company time?,"So I have a pretty boring job and sometimes out of boredom I'll write jokes to myself or little notes to help me write a joke later. Usually I do this on my phone but my boss caught me and told me to not do this at my desk. Now I handwrite these notes and so today I simply wrote ""boner nipples"" as a reminder to flesh that idea out later at home so I won't forget. Well my boss happened to be looking over my shoulder, read it, and gave me a warning about writing inappropriate things at work. Is this allowed?

"Manager set up a meeting for ""Significant Oversight"". HELP.","Hi guys,

 

Please advise on the below if you have the time. Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. Also if you can recommend other subreddits for this situation, that would be much appreciated.

  I work at a big global company that treats their employees like total crap and I can’t wait to leave the job but circumstances arent letting me so far.

 

**Quick background info of the position:** Suppose we are Team X, we work with Department Y and set up projects. Then Team QC, QC’s our works, sends back the findings/mistakes and we have to address them. Then the QC team finally publishes the project. Now the job Is very technical and demands very high attentiion to detail where its just insane because its on TRIVIAL MATTERS. Like Department Y had it as “Troponin-I” not “Troponin I” - like seriously our clients are PIs and PhD holders - they will KNOW WHAT IT IS. I digress sorry.

  **For months now-** we have been getting VERY high number of projects, where as we are always at least 20 (small+big) projects behind (we're a team of like 12). Company wont even hire more people and will keep us understaffed. Company also has a high turnover rate, glassdoor reviews are mostly bad because of this reason amongst many others. The corporate greed is high.

Team X, my team is now fully staffed after months of hiring and rehiring. But the QC team is SO understaffed, and SO backlogged, its like 4 Team X members to 1 QC person, as a result, a project is now getting QC’d 2-3 weeks later, and always right at the publishing deadline. That means these guys are rushing and breaking their backs. Before, theyd publish well before the deadline and we could take our time and address findings. And as you know any rushed work means more errors. The errors come back on us though since we set up the projects.

 

Lately my manager’s been telling me at my 1-1 regroups that I have a lot of QC findings and been telling me that I should take breaks and not get fatigued etc. In my defense - we’re swamped and I’ve been getting high level projects (as in big ones) back to back! But anyway I don’t complain and I just told her I am trying my best. Luckily for our overall error review to date, I met the standards and got average number of errors as every other person in the team (like expected). This was yesterday.

ALSO yesterday:

A QC person had the publishing deadline for a ginormous project I set up 2/3 weeks ago. I’ve been doing my due diligence and working with her this week to address the findings. Then I left for the day, and it turns out one finding had 90 small internal elements that needed setting up - now on paper, the document we use - it looks like 1 line. So this is a common miss. She had to set up these for me and publish late at night. In reality this is an extra 1 hour or 1.5 hour of work even though they are using the number against me. Anyway I  hold nothing against the QC person though even though her manager complained to mine about how upset she was. Understandable.

 

Now my manager is setting up a meeting next week for this “significant oversight”

 

**Now here’s my defense/argument:**

Yes it was an oversight, and my mistake. But in my defense, this study went well beyond my own timelines because the department I was cooperating with assigned their totally new hire lol I had to spoon feed everything AND that 1 line error that I missed, required a code that was released like THE DAY I was told to complete no matter what (also beyond recommended deadlines). This one code was holding up the entire study. Clearly this was rushed and it was the last minute addition that caused this oversight. Its like that last piece of the puzzle at last moment - that increases margin of error ANYWAY for ANY situation if that makes sense. I’ll own up to this. Also on a side note - the noobie was so pleased with me that she's gonna give me an inspire award for it, it's like a shout out. Just trying to tell you guys I don't suck 😂.

 HOWEVER I will not take responsibility for the QC person rushing to publish and meet their deadlines and finishing this stuff on my behalf. The normal process should have been she has to send it to me.  I would have gladly programmed the 90 small elements the next business day. This is a company ISSUE where they obviously don’t give a crap about their employees. QC team requested higher ups to hire more people, and they got declined. And as a result of them being understaffed, backlogged immensely and rough deadlines, she had to go out of her way and address the finding herself. Like thats not my problem. My Manager is also trying to obviously guilt trip me using the QC person’s ordeal but I am not having that b.

 

REDDITORS PLEASE ADVISE. SORRY ITS SO LONG.

**TL;DR: Manager set up a meeting next week because QC person had to address a finding herself because it was her publishing deadline and their team is backlogged. The finding itself is fairly common, and is an additional 1-1.5 hours worth of work and I would have gladly addressed it the next business day. I will own up for it as well. My manager is guilt-tripping me with the QC person's extra work - that I will not own up to because that is the company's fault for keeping their team understaffed and intensely backlogged. How should I tell her this as professionally as possible?**"
"Retail Workers: Rewarding Work, just a Side job, or a complete nightmare?","**To those who currently work in or have worked retail... what did you think about the job?**  
I am twenty years old and have worked exclusively in retail. My first job was Subway where I quickly moved into a Closing Leadership position. I was paid $8.50/hr.   


My second job I worked at for three years was at a Super Target, starting out as a cashier. I eventually cross-trained into different areas and eventually got permanently moved into Grocery with a 50 cent raise. I left the job a few weeks ago being paid $12.50/hr and started at just $10/hr. I was undergoing some career development but my leadership always fell flat on their promises. I was essentially a team captain for the department and I wasn't entirely favored over another guy who just leads with a bit of a better iron fist. I'm one of those guys who loves ""servant leadership"" and keeping morale and motivation extremely high. Essentially, I was the nice leader, and the other guy was the ""GET THIS SHIT DONE"" sort of leader who just barked orders and no one really liked. He was the same age as me.  


My third job now is working at a Costco that is being built and opening June 29th. I'm getting paid $15/hr to do this and my position is a Bakery Wrapper with possibilities to max out my pay at $24/hr in SIX years. I'm entirely hopeful I will experience career development here. I love the company so far, the benefits, and the employees I've met. The store is currently under construction but I've done my orientation, membership sales training, and working close to 40 hour weeks spinning a sign. Once the store opens, my hours will drop to a more part-time basis with the opportunity to get more hours so hoping I can get close to that forty hour week again.  


Anyways, what I am here to ask you is if you have found your retail experience rewarding, either spiritually, or physically(not even going to ask about mentally because we all know the answer..) or if you've found it rather dull, chaotic, hard, or just a total nightmare.  


I've always liked retail for what it is; the human interaction, the team, my co-workers, the customers(the nice ones), and the physical part of it where I am not stuck in a desk all day. I found it very spiritually rewarding but my first two jobs the pay was NOT cutting it.   


There were days where every single customer would look the other way if I said hi, or I got yelled at by a customer for something completely out of my control. Some days, a team member would piss me off or my leadership would say ""Hey, we're documenting your call in the other day."" after not calling in for months due to puking. Funny story, my team leader got sick with the stomach flu two days later and missed an entire weekend. I missed only a Tuesday and came back not puking, but still feeling ill. Things like that would happen that would make me question my employment.   


All in all, retail definitely has it's perks if you are not cashiering. I despised cashiering mostly because it hurt to stand in one spot all day. You'd think it'd be the other way around moving and lifting all day. I'm excited to be making a career out of it and I'm thinking I may attend college in the next year... I have no degree or real professional experience and in six years I could be making $52,000 a year in retail being a worker.  


On the side, I am an entrepreneur and run multiple side businesses that don't pay my bills but they help. That is my only real-world experience. I do have a semi-successful car detailing business that could pull in beaucoup money but in Minnesota, detailing cars outside only works when it's not below 40 degrees and snowing, so I usually need to close up shop every winter since I don't have a physical location and I ride out to client location.   


*How's your retail experience been?*"
Can I be fired for missing work due to heart problems?,"I have been missing quite a bit of work lately due to having chest pain/ severe tightness along with several other symptoms. I am under the care of my doctor and cardiologist, I do keep trying to make it to work, but despite being on weight restrictions right now, they keep making me do things that go against my doctors orders, causing more pain and more issues. I have doctors notes each time I miss or even have to leave early/show up late (I've spent close to $200 8n just co-pays over the last few weeks), but they still write me up for it. I'm terrified I'm going to lose my job, but I need to figure out my health situation.. My supervisor texted me telling me after I was finished with current documentation that needs done, she was going to discuss my position with the company with me, so I feel like either she is going to put me on suspension, or just terminate my employment entirely.
Can she actually fire me for this?"
Should I be worried for my job?,"I work in a retail pet store and saw on my company's website that they are hiring for my position at my store, however as a department manager there is only one person in that role. My numbers are good and I have never been reprimanded or anything. The only problems I can think of are that I have never been allowed to complete management training because my store manager wants us on the floor at all times, and that I am never allowed to take time to assign other employees to clean the quarantine room or do it myself for the same reason, so its always a little disorganized back there."
Suspended with Pay,"I have been in charge of five mechanics, two senior and three very junior, at a manufacturing facility for about four years. Lately the company has been struggling to meet its numbers so one of my senior mechanics was moved to another shift to help. My shift suffered with the loss of experience but we struggled though. Typically it takes at least four mechanics on duty for us to keep our heads above water. Yesterday my other senior mechanic was out along with one of the junior guys. We had a disastrous day. 

Today I come in and got my normal turnovers from my peers when my boss pulls me to Human Resources. I have been suspended with pay pending a performance evaluation by HR. I was not allowed to ask any questions or make any kind of statement. I was just asked to turn over my keys, work phone, laptop, and get escorted off the site. I was not asked to empty my desk. I will get a call in 1-2 business days.

In the past six months I had received two formal counseling , one for failure to message everyone about a machine that broke down and the other for not getting in an injury report in less than 24 hours. Neither of those are recent. As far as I knew my performance has been acceptable and this suspension blindsided me. My annual evaluations have all been great with minor advice for improvement.

I work for a company in an ""at-will"" state

I have never seen or experienced anything like this. All of my peers who had issues were immediately terminated. I am dazed and confused right now. I don't know what a performance evaluation from HR entails. Even if they let me come back, do I even want to now that they went after me? I always keep my resume up to date and I have already starting applying. Any wisdom out there for this situation?"
Not sure how to approach situation I was hired into (I'm a new manager and one employee doesn't respect me).,"This is a long post, but I'm desperate for advice...

I got hired two weeks ago as a manager in my new company (one position lower than the general manager). There is one employee in particular (I'll call her RD) who is very harsh and has an attitude problem towards me specifically. Turns out, RD interviewed for my position but didn't get it, and I did. The problem now is that she is VERY obviously bitter towards me for it and she is openly that way in front of other employees and even my boss. 

The problem is that when the previous manager was preparing to leave, she taught RD a lot of her responsibilities. Now RD has taken over and won't let me touch anything or really do anything that is part of my responsibilities. When I answer the phone she will talk in my other ear about how to answer a question I've been asked like I have no idea what I'm doing. When a client comes in to talk to me, she INTERRUPTS me while I am talking to them to answer herself. It's very rude and is obviously awkward for me and the client. 

I've talked with my boss (who I'll call GM) about it and long story short, he told me that it is going to be an uphill battle for me because she is still bitter about the position. He told me that if I feel the need to talk to her, to talk to her. GM told me that he will try to let us figure it out between ourselves, but if it becomes a real issue he will step in. He also made it clear to me that if I ever needed to talk about it or need advice I can ask. 

GM also made it clear that RD has had issues with the manager before me, GM himself, and even other office staff. He even told me that I'm ""going to make her mad no matter what. That's just how RD is"".  He also said that he doesn't trust her at all with anything personal and that if she walked out tomorrow, we would be okay because her job is just an unnecessary extension of my own. 

RD even admitted to me that she is ""a control freak and has to do things herself"" and that she had a ""tough childhood and that's why she is the way she is"" neither of which are excuses to treat anyone, let alone your boss, the way she treats me. 

I had the opportunity to talk with the girl who had my position before me and she made it very clear that my boss wanted ME for the position and that I need to establish my position with RD quickly. My latest experience with her happened today when I told her that she doesn't need to worry about what I'm doing because I can manage on my own (this is my second week on the job), to which she never made eye contact and responded with ""well I just need things done right"" gave me a slight look, and turned around and walked away. Which leads me to my main question that I really need advice for...

I have never been a manager before, and I'm even amazed that I got this job because I had zero experience in this particular field when I applied. So how the heck am I supposed to handle this situation? I have accepted that I will not be her friend, which I am 100% okay with because she is not a kind person, but how do I go about this in a professional manner? I need her to understand that even though I am newer than her (she only started 3 months ago) I am still her boss and she needs to respect that. And how do I reclaim my responsibilities that she jumped on to take over? 

TLDR; Started a management position and an employee that also applied for the job is bitter that I got it over her. As a result, she is disrespectful, doesn't let ANYONE tell her what to do, and has on multiple occasions shown me attitude in front of other employees and my boss. How do I handle this situation?"
What is the best way to deal with a co-worker who leaves early and makes you do everything?,"I work in a tourist attraction, specifically an observation deck. My job is incredibly easy. I greet or say goodbye to people entering or leaving the elevator and make sure to close the deck with my coworkers once it's closing time. I have a co-worker who's incredibly unpleasant and to that a complete slacker. When she's told to be in the same post as me when it gets busy she will randomly leave for 15 20 minutes, come back late from lunch to relieve me and just now, leave early without a word while I'm left alone upstairs to close the whole observation deck. My managers don't care about her behavior because they avoid confrontation as much as possible.  I am starting to get fed up with the fact that people like her are taking advantage of me and always getting their way while I have to be the one covering them. It's a very easy job and yes boring at times, but I just feel used and stupid. What can I do to stop this? She is very aggressive with confrontation and a complete narcissist so I'm not sure if I should talk to my director or my manager of just her, even though I'm pretty sure none of these options will do anything."
Looking for advice on a particular infraction,"In case it makes a difference my job is in NYC.

Long story short, out company uses paid time off hours for any time you come in late or leave early. They add it using a google form you fill out. On one particular day I left early, told mgmt but forgot to hit submit on the form, def my mistake but bc of that I am now receiving an infraction.

Now, thing is, I reviewed the attendance policy throughly. For latenesses it specifically states that the form must be filled out “before end of shift.” For leaving early though it says “any timeframe.” Only thing is there is no way to indicate on the google form you’re doing it for a day prior so you muss add it manually which I did the next day. So given that the verbiage isn’t specific about when PTO must be added, do you think it’s worth going to HR? Any advice is appreciated"
Given Negative Reivew at New Job Worried About my Future,"I started a new job with a government contractor about three months ago.   

The other week I had my 60-day review with the company, and the feedback was extremely negative. They said I was ""unprofessional', 'profane',  a 'slow learner"" among others according to the client's review.  

They assigned me some extra HR training online, and the HR point of contact sent me a followup with the review in writing while chastising me again.

They also said they are extending the orientation period in my review and want to ""follow up"" with me again in about 15 or so days.

Am I about to be fired?

In the meantime, I've generally been quiet around the office, and things have been going smoothly (knock on wood), my immediate supervisor thinks I'm progressing with my learning, etc.

Should I continue to worry outside of focusing on doing a better job?"
Should my boss get mad at me for asking for days off?,"I'm a high school students who is very active in school. I originally got the job to pay for my exchange student program, but now my mom wants to go on vacation and I won a scholarship to go to a NASA space camp in Alabama, USA for free. 

I'm never late without calling in first (the only times I've been late were due to car accidents, school meetings that I crunched time for, and emergencies) and I've never been late more than 15 minutes. I usually work 6 days a week and work around 20-30 hours a week (about 2 hours after school and full days when we don't have school). They've never yelled at me specifically, but they have been stern with me before, especially with my waitressing (I'm a dishwasher 50% of the time). 

I already asked off for my exchange student program, which is about 2 weeks long, and I'm terrified to ask for the other two weeks off. I'm afraid that they will fire me. Do you think they would? Asking for about half my summer off is a bit of a big deal..."
"Been working 1 year at my current company and I’m still making so many mistakes. I’m ashamed of my work and want to do better, how can I fix this?","So I’m a project coordinator at a big pharma company. Recently I had about 3 major projects due all at the same time. I was really overwhelmed and stressed trying to hurry finishing up the projects in time but that led to sloppy work and it wasn’t done to the best of my ability. I had to get my manager and the director to pull strings for me, wasting their time just to get everything done on time. I know I’ve made mistakes in that I should have brought up that my workload was too heavy, any risks to not completing on time and just asked for more help. 

It was my fault for trying to juggle more than I can take on. This is my first job out of uni and I feel like I’m still learning so much and that it takes me more time to do things right.

I am on a “probation” from my manager. I basically need to step up or my contract will be terminated. I started to fix this by apologizing to everyone involved about wasting their time on this. I also developed an improvement plan for myself to keep myself accountable and can communicate better to my manager. Is there anything else I can do to show that I am trying to improve and do better so that I can gain back trust from my employer?

TL;DR- made too many mistakes that were around the same time and super visible to upper management, how can I save face/is it even possible?"
How do you deal with a nosy/ weird co-worker?,"I sit by a very nosy co-worker who easing dropping in all my conversation and even takes time out his day to stare at my screen. Also, he doesn't seem to remember a lot of things about work and is always asking questions again and again. Instead of agreeing with the process, he wants to argue about the process. He has no manners, he will cough without covering his mouth (worst when you come to work with a terrible flu and refuse to take a sick day), brings fish into work, squeak his mouth because something is stuck in his mouth and chew with his mouth open.  Last but not the least, he has a big staring problem, where he will stand and stare at me or my other co-workers for a long time. 

&#x200B;

I have some of the problems to mentioned it to my manager nothing has improved."
"Made a mistake, company lost a client, not sure how to apologise correctly, also am austistic","I  said something to someone which was taken as a threat, when I thought  it was just warning them of the truth and we ended up losing a big  client (apparently it was the final straw?).

Boss is obviously upset, I might get fired, but also it seems he thinks I'm not sorry enough?

I've  not yet been paid for the work I did last month, and I've not been  lined up any work this month. I am sorry, and I have apologised a few  times already, but I don't know how he wants me to display remose?

I  know if I ask him it'll just feel like I'm making fun of the situation  or something. Like saying, ""I am really sorry, I regret my actions and  ignorance of procedure is there anything else you want me to say?""

I  know the situation is bad, and I know I messed up, but I don't like the  vagueness of ""There will have to be a compromise because I don't think  you understand how serious this is."" Does he want me to suggest my own  punishment? Is he too nervous to suggest something? Does he want me to  dock my own pay - I suffer too if I don't have any work, which I don't  seem to have from him this month. Also doesn't help that he's friends  with my aunt so maybe that means he thinks he can't fire me?"
Is my boss trying to get me fired?,"I had sex with her 5 uears ago at univrsity. She have me an std and just kinda fizzled out. 

Now I took a job unaware she would be my supervisor.   I have no issue with her bit i get a gut feeling she is purpisefully scrutinizing me abd excluding important information from me. 

For example today she made me unsubmit a project so she could amend something she thought was better.  when she came to me originally she said""so why did you do that not this"" she had a gloaty tone about her that screamed she finally got me.  Long story short she did not do her homework and had to go with what i had originally proposed.  She left work at quitting time right on the button and was obviously annoyed.  just before she found out i emailed her a rationale of why i did what I did and she disagreed with me in the email when i was just providing a rationale not attacking her decision. 

When she reviews my proects she latches onto anything she can find to record an error. 

many times she tells me things that are wrongvthat could unhinge my projects. 

However, her own work is riddled with errors so i really cant tell if she is just dumb or harassing me? Other people at work think she is dumb"
Have I already burned a bridge a supervisor?,"I just started working at Walmart as a stocker, and I think I did decent for no previous experience in stocking, but of course I made a couple of minor mistakes, One, I couldn't fit a whole box of yogurt or whatever on the shelf and my Co-worker that was helping me throughout my shift didn't say anything to me about me putting a half empty box back on the cart and my supervisor called me out on it (not so bad). then later on my supervisor gave me another co-worker to work with. and he talks quiet plus he talks while walking off. so we went to the cold storage to start stacking eggs to stock, so I was pulling the cart of eggs towards the door waiting on him then supervisor yells ""don't stand around."" ""you're supposed to follow him and help"" ""This is the easiest way to piss me off, by standing around not doing nothing."" Then about 15 minutes later we started stocking the eggs and the supervisor walked up and told me to take my lunch break early but the way he said was, to me like he was relieving my more experienced co-worker of me helping/learning how to stock eggs. So I thought the standing around situation was a little uncalled for so I came back from break early to talk to HR about the situation because I thought that was a little harsh for someone on their first day. I didn't do these mistakes by choice.

&#x200B;

TL:DR first day of work, went to HR because I felt like supervisor was being too harsh.

Edit: why are all y'all down voting everything I""m saying, just because you disagree

**Edit 2. I didn't go to HR, I went to the person who did my orientation training (personnel) but yes I still overeacted**"
Toxic work environment situation. Is it my fault?,"I started my current job 2 years ago. From the beginning I noticed some cattiness amongst a few of my coworkers  and so had decided to take a stance of keeping a professional distance between myself and my coworkers so as to not get involved. I leave everything that is personal at the door in the morning. I do my job the best I can, collect my paycheck and go home. I make sure to smile and greet people and be cordial but otherwise keep to myself. 

In the early stages, I was able to be an unproblematic fly-on-the-wall, minding my own business, while those around me did their catty rants about each other. One coworker, let's call her ""Coworker A"", seemed particularly hostile to another coworker behind her back, referring to her as ""that bitch"" in a rant for going to management about an issue she had with Coworker A. I ignored it and got on with being respectful to both coworkers without picking sides.

One day, I had to go to Coworker A for some work materials that she dispenses to myself and my immediate team. Coworker A, asked about materials she had previously dispensed to me, and I said that was for [""that bitch""]. She became hostile and said ""it's not my fault you stupidly gave [materials to ""that bitch""], I don't have any more!""

I asked ""why is that stupid?"" 

She quickly backtracked, and said ""I never called you stupid!"" and went on a mini-rant about her suspicion that I will to go to management about her now (like [""that bitch""]) and "" you wear glasses and can't see"" (presumably the discord between coworker A and ""that bitch"".  I saw it, I just ignored it.)

After this incident I went to the manager after work for advice on how to deal with an unnamed coworker who seemed particularly hostile. Without naming Coworker A, they seemed to know exactly who I was talking about. They seemed sympathetic. They said they had several complaints about her but every time they confronted her about it, Coworker A denied it. They suggested I use my cell phone to record her next time, and call a meeting with management armed with that evidence. 

Over time coworker A's hostility toward me grew into mild bullying. She would tell me to perform my job differently from how I am used to performing it. I would politely decline and give reasons,  she would get upset and say ""everybody else does it [the way she told me to], you always have to be different"" etc. 

It escalated until one day she was ranting about me being ""stupid"" for not following her instructions on how to do my job. Mind you, she is not my superior, I don't report to her. The managers have no issue with how I do my job, and had Coworker A gone through the appropriate channels to express displeasure about the way I did my job, I'm certain the managers would have told her I was doing my job the correct way. But it wasnt about how I did my job, Coworker A  wanted to exert power over me and wanted to punish me for not being submissive enough. On this occasion, I was able to pull out my cell phone as she ranted about me in the other room and record her calling me stupid and making derogatory remarks about the somewhat prestigious high school I attended. She referred to me as ""weird"" etc. 

I did as the managers suggested and called a meeting. They asked me to describe the circumstances around the recording I made, asked me to write a report and I did. The managers agreed that the way I was doing my job was the appropriate way. I played them the recording and they heard clearly the verbal abuse from coworker A. Other coworkers were interviewed and the manager mentioned to me that at least one (not [""that bitch""]) corroborated that Coworker A is difficult to work with.

Shortly afterward, I was told that she was asked to apologise and she refused.

Thereafter. Nothing. Coworker A has since been a lot less overtly hostile toward me but she just ignores me and there is constant tension since I have to go to her for materials etc.  Months later, I asked the manager what was the outcome of my report and I was told that because I stopped short of sending the managers the actual recording, relinquishing control over its propagation, there was no proof they could take to the president and board of management to have disciplinary action taken against coworker A. So it's as if there is no evidence at all and nothing can be done, even though the managers heard it with their own ears. I was also told that the fact that Coworker A has a rapport with the president was also a factor.

I am left confused about what I could've done differently in this situation. Coworker A and [""that bitch""] now have seemingly repaired their work relationship since then and are cordial with each other,  while I am now Coworker A's number 1 enemy. Having an ""enemy"" at work is something I find slightly awkward and I wonder if there was something I should have done differently. I feel as though my biggest mistake was taking management's advice."
Told I was full time but I’m not?,"I work at subway and have been under the impression I’ve been full time since January, I talked to the GM and the secretary and they said that if I wanted to they’d like to put me full time, I said yes. Well a few months ago we got new work shirts and I asked how many I got, was told 2 is part time 4 is full time, I got 4. GM also said we couldn’t afford to hire anyone else because I’m full time. 

Well in June I requested 2 days off for August so I could go stay at a casino for my moms birthday with her, we’ve never had to check in for our requests off because we always get them, one only requested one other day off since I got hired for a doctors appointment in early June.

Schedule came out and I had only Tuesday off and I had paid for the room and it was in 5 days. I had basically begged my manager to give it to me because I really needed it and they gave it to me, well she didn’t like that I said something to her and she claimed she “never got the request off” and lectured me for requesting our busy days off.

She tried to call in a co worker early so she could send me home because I had her give me the day off I requested 2 months ago, I know this may not seem critical to this but it is, I was working 35-40+ hour weeks and have covered for anyone even worked 56 hour week one week and did 3 back to back doubles when someone quit and covering for my manager and I’m down to 20 hours a week now, I was told I was never full time just working full time hours, they’ve hired someone else as full time now who used to work there and I don’t know if they’re aloud to do that? Is it going to hurt me the fact I was “labeled part time” all this year but worked full time hours? Can I say I’m full time on applications? Is there anything I can do to my employer about this?

TLDR: was working full time hours and told I was full time several times but I basically stuck up for myself and now they say I was never full time and went from 35-40+ hour weeks to 20 hours"
Can you rejected from a job because you don't look good?,Not your dressing sense but marks on face or pimples. Absolutely not attractive or worth showing off to clients. Can that be a factor in their decision of hiring a person? 
Is This Harassment?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

&#x200B;

I live in an at-will employment state. I'm an exempt salaried worker. I haven't signed a contract of any kind. 

&#x200B;

Now that that's out of the way, down to business. Due to new management, our formerly flexible office (which allows people to work periodically) has turned into a hellscape where we're required to stay in our seats at all times. I do not work a job that should require this, as most of my work is done on a computer without input from other people. So, to avoid the noise, I often leave the area and work elsewhere in the open office. 

&#x200B;

This behavior has put a target on my back, and now I've received disciplinary action from this new manager in spite of being in my seat the vast majority of the time. We had the discussion, and my manager told me that I wasn't in trouble per se, but that we were just correcting a behavior. So, I had PTO scheduled for the next couple of weeks and figured if I'm not in 'trouble', why would it hurt to take it? It was on the calendar as requested, but I've apparently received a flurry of emails in my absence which I haven't been checking due to PTO. 

&#x200B;

So, rather than wait until I'm back, new manager has decided to send me certified mail demanding that I check my email or call her during my PTO. This has never been an expectation in the past as we don't have company provided phones. 

&#x200B;

So ultimately, is this harassment? Do I have any case here?"
Should I love my job?,"So I’m only 15 and im working at a fast food restaurant. I have only been working there for a month and the other workers are getting mad at me because I’m not learning fast enough even though I’ve told them several times I’m a slow learner, but then my trainer told me i need to love working there to learn and said I shouldn’t have came to just make money. I absolutely hate working there and I don’t think anyone seriously loves working a minimum wage job in fast food.

Am I in the wrong to come there to make money and not enjoy working in a oven?"
Nearly risked my job today while trying to get a promotion. Is there any chance of recovering?,"Its been a very bad week. I had an off day a couple of days ago and made made many mistakes that my manager was not happy about. Today I made a great comeback amd my boss said that I was doing amazing and I was sure I would get promoted. Although at the end of the day I was humiliated in the work groupchat when our closing shift was looking for the keys... I opened the store. Very serious problem.  And of course, the person I am competing the position with had spare ones saved the day and my boss praised her. How can I bounce back? What is gold to a manger's ears?
 Please help me destress I cannot sleep"
"One month & 3 days on the job, already being threatened with termination","Looking for opinions & advice here. I had a coaching session today. I work in a emergency roadside assistance department & we were in training for two weeks, then put on the phones. One day in training, I had to miss because I had spent the night in so much pain I was wishing to die. I got around the next morning & showered but was so weak from the side effects of gallbladder, I don’t think I could have made it in. Even if I had, I would have been in & out to the bathroom all day. The next weekend, we had flooding. We were still expected to come in. I left on time but did not realize my route was closed for the flood so I was 22 minutes late. I called & let them know. Then I was six minutes late returning from lunch one day, we only get 30 minutes so I might have lost track of time, got lost getting back (it’s a huge facility) or decided fuck it I’m finishing my food. 

So all this was brought to my attention today, & that I’m not where they want me to be metric wise. I’ve been on the phone three weeks max! I’ve written the below note that I want to share with hr, & wanted some feedback. This is the least tolerant and least compassionate place I’ve ever worked, but I’ve had fewer than ten jobs in my life. WWYD?

Note:  All of the reps I’m surrounded by use profanity while others are on callst, using the F word excessively. Loudly conversing. One rep tolme her “vagina felt like it was falling out”. 
I was told on 6/17 that due to my one absence (I was up all night with gallbladders pain, diarrhea1- , vomiting). I was 22 minutes late one day due to the fact my area was flooded and I had to find an alternate route. 

Saying my talk time was too long - while in nesting it could take half an hour to get help. These calls are not simply question & answer. They are complex, we have to use multiple systems, SOP’s that are not cut & dried. 

I had to yell at the other pod tonight because they were being so loud and disruptive I could not hear my caller. I already could not even understand her. This work environment is the most unprofessional place I’ve ever been. If this behavior had gone on in any other call center, they would have been disciplined. (We have no supervision after midnight). (End so far)"
I (F22) am nervous that I might get fired over 20 dollars. I need advice.,"I just started this position as a bank teller near my house. It's convenient and a somewhat laid back environment. I've been working there for only a month so far, but this passed Saturday I was short 20 dollars.

I was never short before until Saturday. I also think it waa because I gave the Teller next to me 20's that she needed and she didn't give me the right amount back. I had the Control Teller count my drawer and my two other managers. Everything else proofed out correctly, so that's why I assume it could be when I helped out the Teller next to me. Mind you she has worked there for a long time, so I was being a little trusting. I did that for her while I was with a customer, so I could've also gotten confused.

I know it is a rookie mistake and I feel so dumb. There is no excuse for it, but they didn't say much to me after everything. They showed me how to fix the variance on the computer and sighed away. I felt worse, because they didn't say ""It's okay."" Or ""Shit happens."" Which of course I don't expect from them, but they kinda just acted aggravated with me. It was also one of the busiest days of the month and I was kind of nervous. 

I just feel like I might lose my job over something so small. I did all transactions correctly, so it was probably transferring money with the girl next to me. They have cameras, so hopefully they can see where I screwed up. I just hope they don't assume I was stealing. I wouldn't steal my from my own drawer. And if I did, why would I call attention to myself, ya know.

Anyways, I need some advice on how to calm down and relax. I don't go back to work until Tuesday and I've been having anxiety dreams about this. I know this doesn't matter, but I'm pregnant too, so my emotions are on high. I want to know if anyone else had this experience and did they get fired or written up? Also, how to better pay attention when I have million things going on in front of me as a teller?

TL;DR: I was short 20 dollars on Saturday and my management didn't say anything to me. They didn't even tell me if they were going to reprimand me. I'm very nervous, but I don't go back to work until Tuesday. I need to know if anyone else has dealt with this and were they fired? Or just written up? And how to not make this mistake again as a teller."
"Sexually harassed, no one seems to care.","I am a man in my 20's working in a factory floor environment currently for two and a half years. A few years ago I had issues with a supervisor and had to go to HR. Several other coworkers were having issues with him as well at the time. Back then they said they would keep my complaints confidential, but they clearly did not because my supervisor was upset with me for going to HR. He knew everything I discussed with them. This made me extremely uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

Right now I am having issues with a female coworker who's older and works in my area. I should have went to HR sooner, but didn't because of what happened the last time. HR isn't your friend in my opinion. The coworker I am having issues with has made unwanted sexual comments to me and has made comments about me to my significant other. I told this coworker to leave me alone. My significant other messaged her on social media, not being being rude or violent, asking why she was making me feel uncomfortable. She made sexual comments about me through those messages and told my SO to come to our workplace to tell her something in person to ""hurt her feelings."" She told my SO she didn't have the balls to meet her in the parking lot in person. My SO has lunch with me sometimes and sees her there anyways so she decided to just show up like she asked. My SO made it clear she didn't want to get into a physical altercation and was willing to hear what she had to say. My coworker waved her down, my SO approached her immediately telling her she did not want to fight, but was willing to hear what she had to say. My coworker immediately started making sexual comments about me to my SO while I was standing right there. I made it clear that I didn't like what she was saying about me and that I was uncomfortable. She then refused to tell my SO what she invited her to come hear. Then my coworker ran to her car and called our supervisor. They asked my SO to leave and she did. My SO was angry as anyone would be, but wasn't threatening her and made it clear that she didn't want to fight. She's at my workplace all the time to have lunch with me and she goes to company events. We were separately called to HR and I explained that I wanted nothing to do with this coworker after she has sexually harassed me. I asked my SO for screenshots of their messages, and showed HR.

&#x200B;

The next week, other coworkers had heard/seen her yelling at my SO in the parking lot and asked her about what happened. She told other coworkers that we both deserve to die and that we should kill ourselves. She told the other coworkers that she wanted my SO to show up so she could try to convince her and tell her why she should kill herself/we should kill ourselves (but she didn't and ran to her car instead). I was then pulled into HR again that evening. I made it clear to my HR department that I wanted nothing to do with this person and refuse to even work with them. How am I supposed to work with someone who makes unwanted sexual comments about me and wants me and the woman I love to die and thinks we deserve to die? I'm willing to quit my job if I have to work with that person again, and I have informed my HR the same (I am getting training in a different department currently until sometime in September). They pretty much just told me that I don't have to interact with this person and that they hope I don't have to quit. They said they ""handled it"" and that I don't have to interact or speak with this coworker, but they are still making me work next to her in September. Doesn't that count as interaction? We would be standing next to or across from the other. They still expect me to continue to work next to this person once my training is over and I simply refuse. I just don't think any of this should be tolerated, and they seem to not actually be doing anything about it. To be honest, personally I do think she should be fired because I don't think this should be tolerated at all, but I would feel so much better if I could just move to a different part of the factory, I don't really have that option unless someone else quits.

&#x200B;

Maybe to some this might seem extreme, but I don't feel safe around this person at all and I refuse to be anywhere near them. Now at work I skip out on meetings (with permission for the time being) because she will be there, and I have to avoid walking through that area of the factory. I have to park on the other side of the building to avoid her. I have to tip toe around this person that did things that I didn't deserve. I messed up by not going to HR faster, but why should I be the one making all of the accommodations? Why is this being tolerated? I feel like if the genders were reversed, this would have been handled much differently. I feel like they aren't taking my concerns or feelings seriously because I'm a man. I don't think anyone male or female should have to deal with this at work, or anywhere for that matter. It's awful. If nothing happens on my end, I want to at least do something about this to possibly make it easier for the next person who's in this situation.

&#x200B;

I have found the head HR representative of the corporation I work for and the head of compliance. I'm considering writing an email to someone, but I'm not exactly sure how to go about writing the email or who would be best to contact. I'm worried I won't be taken seriously. My options seem to be to email the head HR representative and possibly have good results (by not having to work next to this person somehow), get lucky and hope a job opens up in a different department before my training is up, or unfortunately quit my job. Is there anyone else I should contact instead? How can I make this easier for the next person in this type of situation? If anyone has any tips or guidance on this matter it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

&#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR\*\* A female coworker has sexually harassed me and told others she wants me dead. HR wants me to continue to work next to her. I can't feel safe working next to someone who's harassed me and wants me and my SO dead. Is there anything I can do to convince someone to help me so I can keep my job there?"
Got sent home from work early,So I got sent home from work early yesterday for arguing with my manager and they said they would call back before my next shift which is today. Should I go into work? Or just wait until they call?
Bosses are funny,"My first big boy job and i never thought I'd get a talking to for working late. I have one person above me I'm a junior software dev for a medium sized wfm company. I ended up emailing him  later in the evening than normal cause I found an issue and he got a little mad at me for being there so late. He said and I quote  ""I appreciate your dedication, but you need to go home. We can work on the issues tomorrow. That's why they call it job security. You deserve your sleep."" Never thought I'd get scolded for working more than normal. I am salary so I dont even get paid after 40 hours. Anyone else have situations like this?  Do I worry about it or just keep doing what I normally do?"
How to stop assuming everything needs to be done ASAP? [Discipline],"Hi,

Everytime my bosses say they need me to do something, I immediately jump and work at 110% because I don't know when they need it by and usually since I'm so young, I might have to learn how to do it in the first place. I guess I'm more accustomed to the school kind of deadlines where if I am late, there is no opportunity to make it up where as in the real world, I am witnessing first had other people having deadlines to send to us but are repeatedly late and delayed. Any tips on not having 24/7 anxiety because I am in a constant battle against the clock in my mind? Almost like a ""it'll be done whenever it gets done""sort of mentality? Now I'm not talking slacking, just a little more relaxation. My one boss even has said that i dont need to jump at everything he says because he just randomly talks and says a lot. The few times I asked when they needed it by, they of course said ASAP but then several days went by without touching it. Thank you all very much."
Job attire for a 17(M) year old over summer,"I am starting tomorrow and have a wide variety of clothing to wear so I'm just wondering what should I wear. For information I will be working at a hospital over 6 weeks for SYEP program and am based in New York. 

BTW I did email them but the response was to dress professionally and be presentable. No shorts, tank tops or mini skirts"
How far can a minimum wage employer dictate what you are allowed to do?,"I ask because from how it sounds from friends I know that work at Walmart, an employer can dictate whatever they want.

From what I’ve heard and been told, this example would get you fired at Walmart:

Customer: “excuse me sir, can you tell me what aisle paper towels are in?”

Producer Employee: “Yes they are in aisle <insert number>”

To clarify, from what I’ve been told is that Walmart is super strict on protocol, so an employee is only allowed to answer and help customers that pertain to their “jurisdiction” 

And I want to know what I’m getting into if I got hired, because a cashier offered to pray with my mother because of my mother is recovering from neck surgery and afraid doing something that nice and outside of what’s ordered or outside of position would get someone fired. "
I feel like I'm getting pushed out of my job. How necessary is a two weeks notice?,"I made a couple of mistakes at work about two months ago. All of these are paper typos so not safety related but it was a hassle to fix them and it made my department look bad. Every couple of weeks I'll get a new email over those past mistakes, then there's a meeting with this person or a phone call with this other person. I get it. But at this point its overkill.

Some mistakes were my fault but others were outside of my control and my coworkers and managers are willing to shove me under the bus and push the blame onto me. For me its not worth it to argue over this or that. There's other issues at work so that's not the only thing. Additionally, I'm planning to move out state at the end of the month anyways but I haven't let them know. 

I don't mind giving them 2 weeks but I don't feel like they've handled this issue that well. Also when other people have quit, we've all gone to dinner and had speeches about their impact on the company and I'm not interested in doing that personally after all of this. In a way I feel like I'm getting fired instead of quitting on my own"
How do I deal with my own low work morale?,"I really hate my job I graduated in December and got a job immediately as an insurance agent at a call center. Although I am licensed, I hate it.

I’m just tired and depressed I’ve been looking for other jobs but at this point it’s a struggle to go to work everyday"

Anyone ever been put on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)? How did it go?,I think a PIP may be coming. Is it just the first step toward termination or do people actually come out the other side? 
"Unplanned PTO not honored, worried about sick time","My work has been cutting corners everywhere with money. Nowadays all PTO MUST be planned 2 weeks in advance, otherwise the hours come straight from your paycheck. They don't care if you need an hour here and there to go to the dmv or pick up a sick kid from school.... 2 weeks notice... no exceptions. Which really pissed me off when I was docked pay for using a sick day for a car that wouldn't work...ontop of having to manage the repairs with hardly any money

Today I'm using sick time... but I'm wondering if they can get me for this to. I am definetly sick, but not sick enough to go spend 75 dollars at urgent care to ""prove"" it and potentially make myself worse.

Really hoping that they cover this as at this point I am living paycheck to paycheck. 

Can they fire you or otherwise punish you for calling out sick? "
Had a ‘documented conversation’ but boss had no specifics,"My boss and I butt heads. We are at different ends of our careers, we communicate and work differently. It is a challenge but we acknowledge it and try our best. I have kids and my husband takes the majority of their sick days, my grandmother died since being hired, and my mom was recently in the ER. 

Recently a team deadline was missed, I did 70% of the project split between 3 other part time staff. Yesterday my boss had a typed up ‘record of conversation’ regarding my absenteeism, missed deadlines and how that impacts the team dynamics. She was unable to give any specifics to me about work and missed deadlines. I also have the majority of my time off approved and have notified ASAP with sick kids and taken work home. She said there are no issues with how I am communicating these unexpected absences and that I am using available sick time. 

She was unable to provide examples where I did not complete work. She was unable to provide examples of when I did not make a generous effort to bring work home/make it up later in the week. She was unable to tell me what she expects from me moving forward.

To note, I have had a total of 14 absences since hired in July, 4 unplanned. She has had 27 planned days off. She also is only in the office 5-6 hours a day and I am there 8. She continued to emphasize that it is a full time job and I need to be there 40 hours because when I miss work it impacts the workflow.

She emphasized that my absenteeism is impacting the team culture and dynamic. She was unable to provide examples. 

When I asked for solutions as to how to move forward she had none. When I asked for an addendum to the document with examples she asked why. When I asked for a copy of the sick policy she said she didn’t know where to find it or what it is. 

How do I move forward? I did not sign anything but am expected to."
How to avoid the temptation to be lazy/procrastinate at work when not busy?,"My work tends to alternate between extremely busy periods and down times. The thing is, during down times I've noticed that I tend to slow down and waste time by drawing out tasks that I normally do a lot faster during busy periods.

Although there's nothing urgent for me to do during down times, there are things like additional training/readings to do to advance my career, but I can't do them if I don't make time for them. I'm just wondering if anyone here is guilty of doing the same thing, and if anyone has any tips on how to stop this. Thanks."
I got a job with a company I really really wanted to work for and I haven’t told anyone except my family,"I’m a student and I got hired through my co-op program at school but I have struggled for SO LONG trying to get hired. It’s taken me 4 years, Hundreds of resumes and cover letters, sleepless nights, and interviews that were horrible. I use to brag about interviews and then when nothing happened I would just feel like shit. Now that I finally did get hired, I don’t want to fucking tell anyone. In reality, it’s no one’s business to know anything. Right now I’m just mostly excited and trying to humble myself because I can lose shit with a snap of a finger. It’s a temporary contract but it’s better than nothing. "
"Do you get this unhappy, annoyed, tense or dread feeling waking up to go to work?","I was unemployed for 8 weeks and I am now on my 3rd day of my new (and better) job. 

But, just like my old job, I wake up feeling annoyed that I have to force myself to go somewhere and the fact that I have to do that for the rest of the week.

I think I just need to get used to this routine after having 8 weeks of freedom. It does make me feel unhappy sometimes, but I know it is something we all have to do (I am 22, btw).

I get a pissed-off feeling, stomach tension and get thoughts like ""I can't do this for the next few years"" (but I then combat that with ""tough, I have to save money"").

I am 22, by the way.

Does anyone else feel like this when the alarm goes off on a working day?

UPDATE: So many insightful comments here and it has made me realise that I do have it somewhat better than others. Ultimately, I do like my new job, but I hate going to it every day for 7.5 hours, making money for someone else and working on their schedule. It is my goal to pursue business whilst working. So hopefully I can make something that will allow me to work for myself.

No call no show,"I accidentally didn't go to work today it's been four hours since my schedule and my manager called me two hours after my start time yet I didn't pick the phone up because I honestly thought they wanted me to cover someone else's shift, thinking it was my day off but I got suspicious and checked my schedule and it turns out I'm off tomorrow not today. Should I call him now? I'm a little buzzed ATM hence why I never called and I am asking you guys. FUCK I fucked up. It's only a min wage job but still I never do this.

Telemarketing - How to deal with being cursed out on a daily basis,"So, I landed a new job and it's comparable to telemarketing. I'm not the greatest salesperson (i'm working on my aggressiveness), but I can land a few sales per day which averages to about $17-20 per hour.

"My old boss got put on a PIP, then told me and the rest of the team vague details from the PIP meeting—e.g. the words “not meeting expectations” were used. It kickstarted our team, and people really tried to turn it around and my boss got off the PIP. How much info is okay to share in such cases?","Like if your manager has told you you’re not doing as well as they’d like, and you know you’ll need your teammates’ help in order to improve quickly, how much is okay to share?

In my old manager’s case, they were well-liked enough that people rallied to help them. They didn’t share the info in an antagonistic way against upper management, I guess; it was more of “I really need to turn this around or else I’m not gonna have a job here.”"
Are there jobs that do not require productivity standards or a productivity log?,"had a full-time job that required very unreasonable productivity standards.Meaning I had to produce a certain amount of something in a day or week or month.And if I fell below that they'd write me up. I'm one of those people that has a hard time staying on task. Especially if I hate the job. I really really hated this job. It paid well at least for my situation it was about 30k a year. But the stress that was put upon me by this job gave me health problems and it was a very physically demanding job the repetitive nature of the job really drove me crazy. And hurt my body.

It kind of burnt me out so much that I've been unemployed for about a year-and-a-half I'm afraid even apply for a new job because I'm afraid they're all going to be like that job.I mean they would yell at me and say I was wasting time when I was trying to ask them a question. I can't work those kind of places. I guess my conscientiousness is not very good.

I have a bachelor's degree in history with a minor in business administration. I had a GPA of 3.7.

I just want to know if there's a job out there that has decent pay it does not require production standards and activity logs that keep track of your activities that you do through the day?

Job fired me for posting in the wrong server and not understanding a meme,"To give some background. My job for whatever reason decided to go to discord to conduct business.

Has anyone else ever broken something on their first day of work?,"I work full time at a lab but since exotic animals are a passion of mine and I needed a little extra cash I got a second job at my favorite pet store and they hired me almost immediately which was great, except for the fact that on my first day, yesterday, I was carrying a big heavy tank and it slipped and bumped the corner of the table I was placing it under. The bottom of the tank cracked but didn't shatter, and I panicked and just replaced it and hoped it would go unnoticed. They definitely would have noticed this morning since they use that tank every day to put water in for some of the turtles and since cracked tanks don't really hold water too well it probably leaked water everywhere and someone saw and had to clean it up today. I didn't work today, but I go in tomorrow and since we have to initial everything we do they'll definitely know it was me. What should I do about it? Fess up and tell them it happened or, if they confront me about it, say that I didn't notice and apologize then, since I kinda lost my chance to be honest that day."
"How can you stay at a boring, dead-end job, just because it pays well?","I've been in my job for almost two years and I'm pretty fed up with it. It has its perks:

* I never have to work over time, like EVER
* I don't work on weekends
* Boss is almost never around (it's been almost 3 months since she walked into the office)
* Human Resources is not too aware of the goings on of the people
* My salary is pretty good
* I can pretty much be on Reddit all day and do absolutely NOTHING and pretty much no one cares
* I've been using most of my time reading and learning new things (I'm currently learning a new language, the course is being paid with my own money that I get from my salary at this job)

Still even while having all this pros...I still feel like I want to just quit and find something else, even if its the complete opposite as long as I actually like what I do.

This is a very boring job. Pretty much everything I do seems to amount to nothing, I feel totally inconsequential. 

I've been going to therapy and been trying to figure out why I just can't be like most people who just stay in their job as long as it pays well. Most of my friends are like that. Some even hate their jobs to the point of going bald from stress but don't search for anything else because the money is too good. 

I just feel really guilty about not being productive, even though the job itself doesn't inspire me to be productive. 

I know that if it pays well enough I can use the time after work to get to do the things I like. I remind myself of this every day. But once I get into the office, sit at my desk and stare blankly at my screen...I just can't stand it.

My other problem is, I have absolutely no idea what I want to do besides this. What other job I would like to do that is probably going to be more demanding because that's the norm. "
I hate my job and don't know what to do,"(Please note this is my first post in reddit ever, so if I put this in the wrong place please tell me! Thank you!)

Alright straight to the point, I HATE my job.  As a college student, I thought I'd lucked out getting a retail job for this company (a world wide and pretty expensive cosmetics company).  The job was nothing special, just your basic helping people find their stuff, cashiering, stocking, and the likes.  Or at least I thought it was.  

So everything was going really well, I even got a ""promotion"" and was able to take on more responsibility, which I enjoyed.  I was constantly asking what I could do to improve, what I needed to work on, or if my manager needed any help with anything.  Everything was fine until I had to request time off in order to complete my last semester at college before I could move onto a University.  Trying to finish off classes is normally hard enough, but during this time my parents were always fighting and seriously considering getting a divorce.  Add on top of that the fact I can only go to college if I keep my grades up, as I rely only on scholarships.  You could say I was just a *little* stressed out at the time.  Scheduling for this place has always been bad.  The manager would make it one week in advance, your never allowed to switch shifts with someone else, and in order to get time off you have to request it a month in advance.  So anyways, I told my acting manager (he's actually the assistant, but because the stores real manager broke her leg and couldn't work for a long time, we as the staff filled out a survey which got him temporarily promoted) about everything that was going on with school.  It should be noted that while I didn't love the manager (I actually thought he was and still is super child-ish.  He refuses to take any criticism, is rude, and is super 'car sales man' like to the costumers), the two of us had a pretty good relationship.  At this point, we'd only really only had a one on one when I expressed how much I hated the new sales tactic we were using (basically continuously bothering costumers in every section of the store, even if they asked us to go away).  

So I tell him the issues with needing more time for school and he assures me he will do everything he can.  Next schedule comes out and guess what?  I'm scheduled for MORE hours!  I was pissed, we had another meeting where he tried to tell me ""I did do everything I could, this is less hours, I don't know what you want me to do.  Besides, you only go to school four days a week, you should have plenty of time to work here.""  I had to explain to this man how even though I go to school four days a week, the work load required for my classes was that of a full time job.  So even though it seemed like I had all the time in the world, in reality I was spending hours upon hours a day trying to figure out homework and getting tutored.  Eventually, my manager said he understood and agreed to let me give up one of my shifts.  I was still pissed, but I eventually was able to graduate so my availability became free again.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago.  So, our real manager finally got cleared to come back to the store, and within about two weeks of being back she pulls me into a meeting with the supervisor I'd been working with thanks to my promotion.  They tell me I'm basically de-promoted because of my availability and because the old manager (now the assistant manager or AM) and my supervisor thought it was taking away my commitment on the sales floor.  She also told me the amount of time I had taken off because I was sick or for family emergencies was unacceptable and if I missed another shift I'd be fired.  I was in shock.  That promotion was everything to me, and to make matters worse my supervisor in that position told me they were still ""so thankful for all the work I did and the new organizational systems I had created.  In fact, there so great will still be using them.""  I'm sure they meant well by saying this, but all I could here was ""thanks for fixing everything, but you're useless now so bye!""  On top of that, I even checked with both my supervisor and AM if my availability would affect my promotion, and they both assured me as soon as my hours became open again I could go right back too it.  I ended up having to be sent home that day because I had a break down.  

At this point I just don't know what to do.  I am so upset about the fact they took away my position (I was able to work behind the scenes more and was insured longer hours).  Honestly, what makes everything so much worse was that I never heard anything but positivity in that position.  They never told me I was doing anything wrong, and never gave me things to improve on.  At this point, I know I worst case scenario I will need this job until the summer ends.  Its only a couple of month but with how much I hate this place it might as well be a century.  Does anyone have any advice?  Should I just try to keep my head down and push through it or should I try to find another job?"
"So my ""friend"" got me an interview at her work. so we work at the same company now. It's been 7 months and yet shes so rude to me and I dont get why?","At the beginning sure maybe its frustrating cus I'm making mistakes and learning. 

But today I really had it.... she came to me and said "" does this (envelope) say my name?"" I said obviously not. and she just gave it to me cus I process the mail and put in whoevers folder it belongs to.  before I could have thought she left and I realized the only mail I gave to her was when she came by my desk and i handed her another piece of mail. plus the stamp I use on the mail is black and the stamp on the envelope was red. I figured it was the receptionist cus we split the mail. But i wasnt gunna bring it back up just cus its such a small thing, even tho she blew it out of proportion. I know if I had told her it was the receptionist she would joyfully say okay and prance off.

When its someone else's fault she kindly lets them know, but when its me shes condescending, undermining and rude. 

I dont get why, and I dont know how to end this childish behaviour of hers."
"Coworker forgot to cover my shift, being written as “no call, no show”","I have been working in a bar-type restaurant for the past year without being late and considerably a good behavior. The work place doesn’t have strict policies so the managers and owner often like to blame employees if something doesn’t go right. We do not have a printed schedule, although we have a paper absences for employees to write down and sign, it isn’t always being written down and often times employees and even managers switch schedules without manager’s approval or the paper agreement.

Today I got a call from my manager because my coworker who was supposed to cover my shift didn’t show up. I called her only for her to say she forgot. My manager will give us both a written warning for doing a no call, no show without a written agreement so the liability belongs to both of us, particularly on me because nobody can contact my coworker. Other people say it’s partially my fault for not reminding her. How do I go on about this? I have had bad breakdowns because my workplace can often be a toxic environment but I never expected to be treated like this. I’m unsure how to touch on this matter to my manager and boss because this is the first time this kind of event has ever happened in the workplace."
"Hurt at work, failed drug test, EAP programs","I got hurt at work last Friday, slightly my fault more of my supervisors fault. ( he left the Machine We were working on running as he made adjustments, didn’t follow lock out tag out procedures) But they decided to drug test me on Monday. I failed the drug test because I couldn’t pee. (I’m on antibiotics that caused a UTI. Peeing on command is impossible right now.) I peed the first time and the nurse told me the temperature didn’t read, fine sit down and try again in an hour, I peed right under the line that they accepted and the temperature still didn’t register. Okay fine tried a third time, I drank a bunch of water but alas I wasn’t able to pee. 

My job know I USED to smoke CBD, I quit a while ago and have tried home tests and they came out clean so I know I would have peed clean. But whatever I took the fail, got suspended for three days (all after I submitted a claim with L&I). I had a meeting with my plant manager yesterday and they want me to sign a last chance agreement. 

I’m slightly confused by this agreement. I have to get in contact with a Employee Assistance Program case worker before I return to work. Does that mean they are going to make me go to rehab or counseling? I’m alright with getting randomly drug tested for the next year as I know I’ll come up clean. I’m just slightly annoyed if I have to go into a treatment for a problem I don’t have. I know I can get another job but I like my profession and the people I work with. I just would like to know what to expect.

I’m also annoyed my supervisor didn’t get drug tested, I thought everyone involved in the accident had to be tested. (I could be wrong)

Anyway, thanks for reading!

Edit: if I didn’t flair this right I apologize!"
Opinions on/experiences with “no talking rule?”,"Hey all,

So, I have 4 employees right now. Had 5, but one left already due to the employees having near-daily arguments.

I leave them alone for one minute and they start fighting. I don’t have the ability to constantly watch them, or anyone else I would trust to do so. 

We already had a two-hour long discussion on it, which helped for one day. Great waste of time when we’re already weeks behind schedule.

I’m at a loss. Tbh they’re from a temp agency and I’m pretty much done with them and the agency once I manage to hire more direct employees. They also seldom do a good job, deliberately choose to not follow directions (have a way they think is better), and they call in once a week. Right now I need the help though.

My Hail Mary is to meet with them again this morning and inform them if there’s one more fight, I’ll establish a “no talking rule.” 

Looked into the laws, I can do so as long as they’re allowed to talk during breaks.

I don’t want to, and pray I won’t have to. It’s almost barbaric. 

But I’m at a loss of any other solutions at this point.

I have 3 years management experience and have never had such a difficult staff. My boss is breathing down my neck about all these problems and I about walked out myself yesterday.

Anyone worked under this rule? Did it help or hurt employee arguments?"
"My coworker went through my email on at least 2 occasions and forwarded herself a few of my emails, I am conflicted on what to do about it","A little background info : I work for a big health care company. I work in one of their medical offices and in my job I interact with many patients a day and I have access to their medical information and have to chart. We have a lot of computers in our department and we use those computers to chart patient info as well as do many other things. My job gives every employee a username and password to log onto windows and that same information is used to log onto our work emails. On certain computers when you log onto windows, you can simply click on the email application and it will open up your work email without entering in a password again.  For my position, there are 2 computers that are primarily used among my coworkers and I, one of those computers i set up to that once we log onto windows, our email will open without needed to enter a password.

So, a few days ago I was logged onto one of the computers because I was working on that computer, i never logged off because i was going back and forth from that room and it takes minutes to log back on. One of my coworkers had come in for a shift for the second half of our day. When she came in she was assigned to work in the room I was originally working in, the one that I was logged on the computer. A few minutes after she had clocked in I went to that room to tell her something and i saw the computer screen was on my email page(I realized i had left my email open because the last time i used it the webpage froze on me and i never got to close it). When my coworker saw me she got startled and made some bs about how she thought she was logged into her email and then said ""i will log you out right now"" I was suspicious when that happened but didn't think anything of it and just assumed she would log me out since she said she would. That day passed and when i came into work the next day I opened my email to respond to a message I was having with a union representative, when i opened the email somewhere at the top of the email it said ""you forwarded this email at 2:06 on January 24th"" When I saw that i right away realized something was fishy, i looked through my sent and deleted boxes and nothing was in there. Much to my luck, our email system allows us to recover deleted emails within 30 days and that option popped up and low and behold i recovered 2 deleted emails. Both of those emails were emails I had with a union representative in regards to my job and both of those emails were forwarded to my coworker who was using my  computer and had my email open when i walked in. One of those emails was sent a week before the other, one on January 18th and one on the 24th. On top of that, this girl had to really look through my email to find these conversations. The first one she forwarded was in my sent box so she had to have looked literally through everything. 

I have no clue how to handle this situation: I have a few options: 1. Would be to report her for doing what she did but i'm certain she would get fired. 2. I confront her about what she did and tell her she was wrong and to never do it again to me or anything else, and just ask her how she would feel if someone did this to her etc etc. 

I understand that people can be curious and maybe if they see someones email open they might read what they see on the page (although this is wrong either way), this girl did way more than that she went through many of my emails to find these emails and she freaking sent them to her self. I don't dislike this person and although i would never ever trust them, i dont no if i feel comfortable reporting them because they might lose their job. However, I am conflicted because my job does require us to report certain things to compliance, for example if my coworker was accessing my medical chart or another coworkers chart she would have to be reported right away. However, I don't know if accessing my emails falls under the same category(of course her doing this is still extremely unethical).

What would you guys do if this happened to you? What do you guys think I should do? Will talking to her be enough for her to never do this again or will it simply make our work situation hostile. Will she try to sabotage me for confronting her? Idk I feel like I am in such a tricky situation. "
"Misunderstood how many sick days I got, learned about it 2 years in","So I had my biweekly 1-on-1 with my manager on Wednesday, the meetings are usually just us talking about how I'm doing on my project, company updates, etc. Never really had an issue in my two years. But this week he kind of awkwardly brought up that I was -73 hours on sick time. Apparently I misunderstood our sick time as 15 days/year but it's actually 10. I had been slowly going deeper negative over time, and neither my old manager nor this manager noticed until now.

He made sure to mention that he knows I'm a good performer, he recognizes it wasn't intentional, and he hasn't heard anything from HR about it. He still said he'd like to talk with the managers one and two levels above him to figure out what to do about it since he'd never dealt with this before. He came back like 30 minutes later and reiterated I'm not in trouble, but to just not mark sick on my timecard until I'm in the green and use vacation days instead if I'm sick.

I'm not upset about the outcome, he sounds understanding. But I am embarrassed and I really dislike the feeling of being in the spotlight like this in the manager chain. This, coupled with the fact that I've been using my 2018 sick days a little judiciously in the past month as I adjust to my antidepressant dosage change.

I typed this all out and I guess I don't have a question because I'm not in trouble and the solution is clear. But anyone with a similar experience would make me feel better lol, because this sucks and it took me from a 3 month streak of loving the work day to dreading it because I'm self conscious that I'm not performing well enough now. If you're a manager, what would you do in this situation and what would you like to see from the employee? I'm worried it's going to affect yearly bonus/raise offers this year or in the future."
"Have gone above and beyond for over two years, make one mistake and end up suspended/hours cut. Advice?","Long story short: I've been with this place for two years. I show up early and leave late every night. I do more than what's asked of me. My coworkers/manager notice, but have gotten lazy because of it. 

My bosses rarely ever come to my location. We're not considered much at all, compared to the others. Everything we have is outdated. Everything we do we put together ourselves, often on our own dime. My department is specifically suffering as our software hasn't been updated in over a year and I only get reassurances, rarely any results. 

We had a company meeting recently, of which I was late. Not on purpose, I just forgot. As punishment I was given a menial task to be completed along with someone else that was late. I ended up doing it all alone, but after my boss saw it. The other guy wasn't there. 

A week later I missed another meeting completely. Not on purpose. I'm dealing with anxiety and depression right now and I just can't do appointments. I canceled every doctor's appointment I've needed in the past couple of months because of it. 

The bottom line is that I feel taken advantage of. As much as I do for that company, I make one mistake and my hours are being cut to the point where I can't pay my rent anymore. Not to mention the money I have to pay to update software at work because *they* won't do it. 

I might have some kind of meeting with them. Should I bring any of this up? Should I bring up the depression? Should I just quit??? I don't know what to do."
[Help] Meeting Store Management Regarding Bullying,"Hi - I could use some advice please!

I have a meeting tomorrow morning with the Store Manager and Assistant Store Manager at the supermarket I work at in Australia, it is a large supermarket chain. I will not name them, however, I recently made a complaint to my line manager after I experienced inappropriate behaviour from the duty managers supervising the night shift that I worked (several times).

Among other things, the following happened:

* Duty manager kept us in the store after midnight when our shifts had finished, yelled at the team and team supervisor saying we had ""no sense of responsibility, never have and never will"" as we didn't finish putting away all of the stock (short staff, 2 new people on the shift)
* Duty manager confronted me in the bathroom on a 3-hour shift by the duty manager, 3-hour shifts have no break and I was told I was not allowed to use the bathroom during the shift
* Yelled at for purchasing a drink during my shift (again, 3 hours with no break) after I forgot to bring one, which is fine, but it took longer to lecture me about it than it did for me to buy the drink
* Told that ""heads will roll"" if I did the wrong thing

After experiencing this and general inappropriate behaviour and expressions from these duty managers, plus, having other staff share in my feelings, I made a complaint to the line manager and said I would consider resigning.

The store manager then contacted me and has requested a meeting tomorrow to discuss what I have said. I feel like this will be held against me at work and that I can't go back. I'm not sure what to say in the meeting either and I don't want to be intimidated as I have been so far."
How to communicate to my boss diplomatically that I feel demoralized?,"I guess I’ll flair this as discipline, because it’s a masked punishment. Not to mention, it makes me feel like a child; I work my butt off for this company and cry weekly. For instance, I put in 60 hours one week LEADING a convention and have helped to win us two military bids by catching errors in final print which our proposal team missed.  This treatment, and feeling burnt out, is the main reason I’m jumping ship to go teach English abroad, but that’s a different story. 

4.5 months ago (can check post history), there were some major family issues I had to deal with. This, in turn, affected my productivity at the office. While I was not put on a PIP, I was asked to begin documenting my tasks and hours spent on them, and sending them to my boss. She maintains that it is to help me become better at my job with project and time management. I maintain that it is trying to mold my work style to fit something she can control. 

This requires me to be meticulous and track every hour - one day, I sent them a time log with only 7.25 hours recorded and said, “hey, I don’t know where the time actually belongs, I’ve been in the office for 8.5 hours and I’m sure it was used to send emails etc.”

I then received an email that “all 8 hours need to be recorded and I’ve also heard that using your phone at your desk is still a problem” (not saying it’s 100% ok to be on the phone in the office, but I take 5 minute breaks to clear my mind; my coworker spies on me and reports my actions, also if I talk to other coworkers ‘too much’).  Side note, you will be billed for all my hours I am in the office, minus lunch, even if I’m getting a coffee or going to the bathroom. Period.

Well, it’s been 4 months of this. My boss has been on maternity leave for the last two but I have to keep submitting them to my spying coworker. I want to breach the subject of no longer doing these - it’s so demoralizing and I just dread coming into the office. Further, if I work on 3 things at once, sometimes it’s 5 minutes here, 15 there, then back to a different project. It’s wasting more time for me to write down every movement than .... I don’t know.

I feel burnt out. Sad. Can’t get my thoughts together. I just don’t want to do these lists anymore. I’ve thought about just refusing but I can’t until I have a solidified back up plan. And that’s anywhere from 2 weeks to 7 months away. 

Help?"
"I missed a day of work because I did not know my schedule, am I going to get fired?","I am 16 and I work at Mcdonalds.

 I just got hired about a month ago. I was never on the actual printed schedule or the one in the system, so I was mostly working undocumented hours (but I knew all the hours I work). One day at the end of my ""shift"", I asked one of the managers in store to put me on the schedule for the next week. I asked him how to figure out what days I had to work and he just told me to talk to the hiring manager. I texted her (twice, because she left my 1st message on Read) and on Saturday she told me that the schedule for ""this week"" is already done and that she would make sure I was on NEXT week's schedule. I assumed that ""this week""  was the schedule for the next week (the days after that Saturday in which she texted me back) and that I would have to wait a whole week to get back to work. I did not text her back because she was adamant about how she did not read texts when she was not working, and seeing as how she was my boss, I did not want to get her any angrier. So now I just missed a day of work and I did not know. The hiring manager texted me back and told me that I missed my shift and said that ""whenever you need to find out your schedule, call the store on Thursdays and Fridays"". It would have been great to know that in the last text you sent me. Will I get fired for this? I guess this kinda is just all my fault for being stupid but I don't know, please help."
"My boss tried to pressure me to come into work, at a restaurant, while I have the flu.","This flu epidemic is scary. Last I saw over 70 people have died of it. I work in a franchise diner, as a server, and many of our customers are elderly people. I think it could be extremely irresponsible to put people at risk of getting sick, not to mention putting myself at risk by working night shifts on my feet for 8-10 hours while I'm really sick.

I told her initially that I was afraid I might have caught the flu, and I missed one shift. I had the following three days scheduled off, so I told her that if I wasn't feeling better by my next scheduled shift, I would get a doctor's note. 

I called the afternoon before my next overnight shift, and told them that I was definitely sick, it definitely felt like the flu, and that I'd be going to the doctor ASAP. I asked if I could bring the note in tomorrow, and she immediately got irritated with me, and said that if I didn't bring in my doctor's note before my shift that night, I'd be fired. I told her I'd try to get one today, but either way I didn't think it would be reasonable for me to come in coughing and sneezing, and serve people food and prepare their desserts, etc. She said that's not a good enough excuse, and that I should just come in because ""that's what everyone has to do even if they don't feel good."" She said unless I have a fever, it just sounds like a lot of excuses. 

So I spent 5 hours in the ER on Friday, while they were insanely busy specifically because of the flu. Got a flu test (positive), and they wrote me a note saying that I'd been seen, and had the flu. I immediately drove to work, gave them the note and they said, ""Okay, so you'll be back tomorrow?"" I said no, guys, I have the flu. You are absolutely not supposed to work in food service if you have the flu, especially during an epidemic. 

I spoke to my boss again and she said that if I'm going to miss any more work, I need another note from a doctor saying when I'm cleared to come back to work. My boyfriend had our only vehicle and was working, so I took a bus to the ER, waited a few hours, explained my situation, and they wrote my a note clearly stating that I have been diagnosed with the flu and will not be cleared to work until after the 15th, and if get worse or get a fever, add another 24 hours to that. 

I understand that it's hard for her because I'm fairly new, and she has to have someone fill in for me, but I think it's entirely unethical for her to guilt and pressure me to work when I could infect other people or worsen my own condition. What if I infect my other coworkers and then we all miss work? We do not have any kind of sick leave, so she would be screwed and so would we (I'm surviving right now because I made my serving tips last, and my boyfriend just got his tax return. But I have not earned money this week.) 

She seems to just generally have a bad attitude with me now, and while the assistant managers still like me, she's the general manager so her word is it. I have the experience, should I be looking at other jobs? I feel like there's just going to be a bad environment there now, and my other co-workers all seem to be intimidated by her also. She also only writes schedules one week at a time, and writes each schedule the day before it starts, so it's really stressful trying to plan anything unless I know about it in enough time to put in for the days off. 

TLDR : My boss is kind of unprofessional and rude, and pressured me to serve people food while I have the flu. She seemingly does this a lot, and people don't ever stand up to her because it's just a franchise diner and they probably know they can be replaced. 

Has anyone had experience with this? It seems unprofessional, and maybe even against company policy (though she didn't give me an employee handbook so I'm not sure). What would I tell my next employer about why I quit this job? Would it come off like I was just whining and had bad attendance? 

UPDATE: My boss now says that the 2nd note I brought her, stating that I was cleared to work again the 15th, does not have the proper letterhead from the hospital (it was written by a nurse) and I'd need to get another note before I can come back. I told her I don't have my car right now, and I think it's pretty unreasonable of her to ask me to take a bus, in the cold, while I'm sick, back to the ER for a non-emergency, just to ask them for a better note when she could just call the number they provided on the note if she has any questions. 

Jesus. "
How does one deal with a lazy store owner?,"I work at a Chick-fil-A nearly full time. We have this owner that most of us, managers included, agree that he does less than minimum. Owners are responsible for running the store and making routine purchases but he RARELY shows up. When he does, it’s to point fingers or to hold weekly, hour long meetings that change nothing and it doesn’t help that he generally doesn’t consider input from anyone. One example is the night time manager asking for more hours to give employees because it was just too unpredictable and we were understaffed but he basically said he didn’t want to pay for the extra hours. Additionally, I heard that our director is actually paying the bills; not the owner. I assume he just gives her access to some billing account and makes her do it. Lastly, the best evidence I have is that our store is horribly under average in nearly every area and most of my coworkers are good employees in my opinion. What steps can us hard working employees take in this situation?"
How to deal with not doing something your boss asked you to do?,"Me and my manager were off on holiday at the same time last week. 

Before I went on holiday my manager asked me to sign something in her name and send off once she’d had a read through as she was on holiday that day. 

I waited for the go ahead, nothing so I text her as she was at the airport if she’d managed to read it so I can sign and send and I got no response. I even waited an hour after work in case she messaged then. Still nothing but I had to leave to pack and go to the airport and couldn’t wait longer. I signed the form and sent it to myself so if she messaged me in the evening I could send from my phone. Still nothing. When I was on holiday I couldn’t get my work emails due to lack of connection and I just left it as I couldn’t enjoy myself as I was worrying. 

Well I’m back to work tomorrow and now I’m so scared I’ll be in huge trouble for not sending it as she said it had to go that Friday. But she also said she would read through to check it was fine. As it was signing and agreeing to something on behalf of the company and I didn’t get her response I didn’t send it. 
Am I to blame? Should I have just done it? My heart is pounding for tomorrow. But imagine it was wrong and I signed it?"
"NEET, about to turn 28. Degree, but no real work experience or skills.","This is going to sound long-winded so I'll try to keep it condensed. I'm a 27-year-old guy, two months away from turning 28. I've been NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) for about 1 year and 7 months. I graduated from college in Spring 2014 with a Bachelors of Arts in English. Truth be told, I never really knew what I wanted to do in life. I'm not good at math or any of the sciences, and only really settled on English because the graduation requirements at my school were lenient. My single mom placed an extreme emphasis on going to college while I was growing up, as she did not have her degree and never made much money. The main issue I have though is that I was never a very studious individual. I was bullied very heavily in college for a number of reasons, and I spent most of my teenage and young adult years overweight, depressed, and socially awkward. I've had jobs, but they've all been retail and I've never held one for longer than a year. My highest paying job was an assistant manager for a small pool store, which was just a glorified keyholder position that paid only 12.50/hour that I was let go from, mainly because my poor social skills made me disliked by my boss and my forgetfulness was making him lose patience.

The few friends that I have are all in jobs typically geared toward intellectuals. They're all programmers or in IT. They make close to six figures which makes me feel like a failure by comparison. The unfortunate side is that I've never really cared that much about math or learning skills. I just wanted a job that paid enough for me to live comfortably and afford things like video games or anime merch. I don't have any interests or hobbies that can be turned into a career. When I was in college I just assumed that getting a degree in any subject would enable me to find an entry-level job, but after dozens of interviews following my graduation I realized I had nothing to offer any employers. Sales is not an option because I do not have the social dexterity needed to perform well, and my appearance is not what I'd call ideal.

I don't know what to do. I know I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do to support myself for the rest of my life, but I get so overwhelmed that I shut down and do nothing. I know I need to focus on my diet, get some exercise, lose weight, and be on a good sleep schedule. I don't have the motivation or energy though. The only positive side to my situation is that unlike many people I know with degrees in useless majors, I have no debt from having good financial aid. I am not sure if going back to school for another degree at my age will be worth it, as I will still graduate with no experience.

Are there any entry level jobs that are just looking for four-year degrees in any subject? Right now my big priority is to at least start working and then figure out what I want to do from that point on."

My boss is going too far.,"TL;DR: My brother and me work at the same job. But because he's had less experience than me, my boss is very harsh on my brother and gets him in trouble at the smallest, dumbest things that arent even that big, and are stuff that i do a lot. He's threatening to fire him for dumb reasons, and I've told my boss ill leave too if that happens. But this job has been good to me.


I really need advice on a current situation that I'm in, because I'm not exactly sure how to go about it.

I'm in highschool, and about a month ago, I started a job as a receptionist for a barbershop. Its been quite decent; the environment is friendly, the co-workers are nice, and I can handle it pretty well. Most of all, the boss is really proud of my work. I've been trained well, so I knew what to do by the fourth day. I've never had a job prior, but I have had experience with dealing with customers due to volunteering at multiple places. 

Two weeks pass, and my brother requests to work as well since he's in need of experience. He's only a year below me, but his personality is a bit different. He's more timid, shy and quiet. Plus, he has had no experience beforehand. To make up for this, I made sure to have his shifts correlate with mine, so that I can train him and all that. The boss did train him as well, but didn't really go in depth with him like he did with me which I found to be a red flag at the start. It seemed unfair.

Few days pass and my brother is doing pretty well considering his personality and his first time ever working. However, there is one issue and it's that my brother can't multitask. For instance, this job also requires cleaning stuff like sweeping hair off the ground, wiping the windows, or dusting the supplies. However, while doing all that, you'd still need to be aware of the customers and make sure that everything is going smoothly. That's where my brother lacks understanding. He does things in a 1,2,3 fashion and doesn't understand how to do all that especially because it's quite stressful on someone inexperienced. 

Therefore, I asked the co-workers to help him through all that, and ease his stress. Since that started to work, I requested my boss to have seperate our time shifts because he seemed ready.

My boss has cameras that have audio and he can view them via his phone. He doesn't watch them when I'm working, but does when my brother is working and starts to poke at every little thing. He also frequently visits the store when my brother is there but never when I'm there.

Everyday after work my brother comes distressed and upset, and everyday my mom gets complaint calls about his work. Me and my mom are quite pissed at my boss's claims, especially when we hear my brother's side of the story (and my brother doesn't lie).

First, he claims that my brother is horrible at cleaning. Mind you, my brother is a clean freak and theres NO WAY that's true. I'm a worse cleaner. I even tested it out once. Once my boss was in the shop, and he was just sitting on his laptop doing his work in his office. I knew the windows were dirty, they had finger smudges everywhere. But I left them there. And he didn't do anything to me. Yet, today after my brother's shifts I hear him tell me that the boss made him clean it 3 times because it ""had a smudge."" What the fuck.

Secondly, he claims my brother doesn't do his job. Sometimes, the barbers check the computer at the front to see the waiting list of the clients, any potential appointments, and how much clients they've had so far.  And I let them, but I watch them ofc. Rarely, there will be times where they do the transactions themselves, but it would be if I'm in the washroom. And my boss has seen me do this. Yet, when my brother does this, my boss yells at my mom claiming that his co-workers arent trustworthy and my brother is too easy to manipulate by letting them tamper with the laptop. This also happened with the phone, where once I was dealing with a customer and the phone rang, but my co-worker answered it (which turned out to be the boss) then gave me it when I was finished. I wasn't in any trouble. But the same exact thing happened to my brother, and he got yelled at on the phone.

Thirdly, he claims that my brother sits idly all the time. While I do know what he's talking about, I have consoled my brother about this and told him to always be aware of your surroundings. Usually my brother just stands around when hes done his duties, but he's supposed to look out for anything else he needs to do. When he's sure that there's nothing, he's free to stand behind the register and relax. I do it all the time. But my brother is not even ALLOWED to relax at this point, because my boss keeps calling him lazy and other stuff even when he's literally done everything. 

And the best of all, my boss constantly compares me to my brother. He always tells him to ""be like your sister"" and criticised him otherwise. This pisses me off a lot, especially because we have DIFFERENT amount of experience. I think its absolutely stupid that my boss, instead of HELPING him, CRITICISES him for not being like me! We're not even the same people!

I genuinely see this as absolutely unfair. I don't even want to work for such a man anymore, but this job has been very great. I don't even know what to do at this point. My boss keeps threatening to fire my brother, and I've claimed that if my brother leaves I could leave as well. I understand firing my brother if it was because he thought he was not suitable for the job, but the reasons my boss has given is an unfair reason for firing anybody. 

Please, I don't know what to do at all.

Edit: Typos"
My manager is trying to write me up for not showing up for work even though I was not scheduled for that day.,"I was originally scheduled to only work Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday this week but my coworker told me yesterday that my manager is trying to write me up for not coming to work on Friday. I was never scheduled Friday however my manager took the liberty herself to schedule me for Friday without my permission or even calling me to come in. I have evidence I wasn't suppose to work Friday (paper posted schedules and recites of hours I work) so I just wanted to ask what should I do and is my manager even allowed to do this."
Risking being fired for reasons outside my control?,"Can you get fired if you call in to work because your car won’t start and you’re stuck in another city for two days? Going by Texas laws. I let my assistant manager know 8 hours before my next shift was to start (because that’s when I had got the information), and she says that there’s nobody to cover me and it’s a holiday weekend, so I need to show up, else I could be fired. It’s not my fault that my car broke down (Someone stole the starter out of it while I was asleep, idk how), and it’s not my fault that my employer can’t keep employees. I’m their longest term employee, I’ve only ever called in once before because I was flooded in, and I’m the only person trained to work nightshift (Which is a solo shift I’ve been doing for a bit over 11 months, and haven’t gotten any time off I’ve requested in around 9 months). The store itself is understaffed because they always scare off new employees and the store manager is on maternity leave, leaving just the two assistant managers in charge of the store. Can they/will they fire me?"
Fight or Resign? Really need some advice.,"Hey guys, Sorry in advance for any rambles, bad grammar, spelling ect ect. I will try and keep this as short as possible. I work within the Civil service UK if that make any difference.

I suffer with anxiety and depression and my job does not make the situation better. Not so much the job but more the people. There was an incident on the phone where others complained about the way i had said something to a customer. This was not true. We finished the call and the customer did not call back at all.  I was taken into a room by a manager and spoken to about this. Not my manager a different manager, at that point in time, there were NO managers on the floor. He had asked me what was said so i explained what i said to the customer. He had advised that others in the office had complained about me and that i was aggressive and rude ( i certainly wasnt). Baring in mind, we work in an open office and there was no one around me during this call. He asked if i was okay, apparently he was making sure i was okay. No im sorry.I walked out of the meeting as i felt as though he was only asking me to cover his ass and people were gossiping as per usual.

&#x200B;

After this incident i was sick with anxiety, i was fuming and was winding myself up. Another who sits behind me (she was not there during the call) was asking me about what happened. This is not the first time something like this has happened and my frustration built and built and i started crying and I said I needed to leave. I said 'Everyone is a bunch of backstabbing cunts'. Then left the office.

I can 100% take responsibility of this. I was angry, frustrated and unsupported. It was absolutely stupid and I told my manager that i needed to leave. When i got home I had a panic attack and was shaking with emotion. The next day I couldn't bring myself to go to work to i went to the doctor for advise and he signed me off with anxiety and depression for 2 weeks.

Yesterday was my first day back. My back to work meeting was left till the last hour all day so I was concerned all day. Apparently my last absence, which was also anxiety and depression (not doctors note as i was in the 5 day self certified absence) was my final written warning  which means that they will take this instance to pannel. I have no occupational health review right now but i was planning on calling them today.

AS WELL AS THIS. more than one person complained that i personally called them cunts in the office. So i 100% should not have said something like that out loud but due to my frustrated and upset state it just came out. In no way was it personal to anyone and the manager around me will say it wasn't personal. But more than one person complained. So this is also going to a misconduct meeting. I have no notes on my record about this but im a blunt person, i dont beat around the bush. Im not passive aggressive like people in the office i just say it how it is and people do not like it.

I am absolutely sick to my body about this whole situation, yesterday i couldn't stop crying like what the absolute hell is wrong with people. My manager has given me the option to resign immediately without having to go through all of this. I was going to hand my 4 week notice in next week as im moving to another side of the country. But i need the money. Obviously there is no way anyone could tell me what to do, but i dont think mentally i could handle all these meetings, and having to go to work everyday around these insects unless i thought i had a great chance. I have a couple of people in work who will 100% support me if i do.

&#x200B;

I am going to call an employee helpline this morning and occupational health, but apart from that i need to decide if i should resign or not. Everyone I have spoke to have advised me to fight it. A couple of people have said to go off sick for 4 weeks and then resign? Im not at a loss of what to do. 

I know its early, but i would appreciate any advise! Thanks x

Throwing up every morning,"Pretty much the title. I get up, take my shower, brush my teeth. I then think “Time to go to work” and I immediately get physically ill. This happens every morning. It’s not even food, just a horrible awful feeling. Is it anxiety? I just started working in an outbound training call center about 3 months ago and I’ve been doing this every morning. What the hell am I supposed to do to fix this?

Edit: Thanks for the messages guys, It helps. I stress posted this on break this morning, it seems like most obvious answer here is that I may be suffering from some sort of anxiety. I'll look into it."
Found a job but it’s in a call center and It sucks,"I have never worked for a long time because my parents used to tell me how they could pay for my things and that I should focus on studying, I was careless but just until a few years I realized I needed to find a job to contribute to society. I found a call center job  but:

1. The trainer in my call center is treating us like slaves, wanting us to do homework after our shift ends and then requesting presentations for the next day, leaving us no time to rest.

2. Management is constantly threatening us to fire us if we mess it up, I don’t even want to make a mistake because I don’t know the consequences.

3. I don’t socialize with my coworkers, I find them very vulgar and the type of person who likes gossip and I’m just not like that, I’m also not used to people who doesn’t respect diversity and I find myself alone, I don’t talk to people here apart from the hi and bye.

4. I need the paycheck for my things and so I don’t have to rely on my parents anymore. I want to be free but with my parents help that’s almost impossible. I felt miserable without a job and now that I have it...I feel I’m in a very negative environment. 

What can I do to last long and gain experience? I want my parents to know I’m determined to be independent and also be disciplined and be a good worker.  

TL;DR: I found a job in a call centre but management or anyone above agents treats us like slaves and there’s no other job I can find that pays like a call centre in Central America. What can I do to survive, gain experience and not suck? "
I’m a recruiter for internships at my organization. Just hired a graduate assistant and NOW learn from someone else that she’s a horrible employee,"So to put this in context. I’m 23 years old, a recent college graduate, and I work at a research organization within a university. I’m a very recent hire and my job is to recruit student workers, volunteers, interns, grad assistants, etc. And basically be their “boss” aka I have the power to hire, pay, and fire them. Which is a HUGE responsibility! 

To get to the problem, I hired a grad assistant and I just had orientation with her this morning. One of my coworkers recognizes her, pulls me aside IMMEDIATELY and tells me “that girl does NOT do her work, she doesn’t get along with anyone, she has an attitude, and she’s overall a bad employee”. This is from a past experience working with her, I guessed.

I just submitted all her hiring paperwork to HR, and she’s here to stay for at least the next year, is what I told her. I’m supposed to talk to her actual boss tomorrow and warn her about this girl. Also, this girl is 30 and I’m scared she’s not going to take me seriously if i try to talk to her about her performance. This is one of the reasons I don’t like being in charge of people my own age, or older.

I don’t know, I’m trying to prepare for every scenario possible in my head and I’m freaking out. It’s not like I can fire her but I feel like I really screwed up and I should have seen this coming when we interviewed her in the first place. She SEEMED like a great candidate, she clearly had the experience necessary for the job, but the way she talked was very off-putting and it really didn’t seem like she would fit, but we had to hire someone and she was the only “good” candidate.

Basically I don’t know how to discipline people if they are not complying with our policies or not completing work assignments. I really don’t want to have an awkward conversation with her, and I especially don’t want her to get angry. UGH! I’m beyond stressed about this as you can tell."
Should I tough it out or jump ship?,"I started this job the last couple days of April. It's my first full time office job, before this I've only worked part time as a tutor, retail, and prep cook. I was excited about it at first but now I dread going into work and I'm honestly only posting now cause I can't sleep because of anxiety. 

It's data entry for a pharmaceutical company. They used to have my department in another state, but decided to move everything to this state in like a couple months and replace all the experienced people there with new people here. So we're expected to be able to do the quantity and quality of work after like 2 months of experience of people who had been there for years.

And it's only 12 dollars an hour. 

I'm constantly told what I'm doing wrong,and absolutely no positive feedback to balance it out. They want a certain amount of work done which I'm struggling to meet so I rush things and make mistakes. 

Yesterday my boss called me in for a meeting with another supervisor from the other state on speaker. They told me they're lowering my daily goal of work for the next 2 weeks but they need my accuracy to go up. And it's weird cause they'll say focus on quality but then follow it up with that they do need my quantity up. They said it was a coaching session bit it just felt like reprimand. At one point my eyes started to water and my boss told me not to be upset in her sickly sweet voice I've come to hate. They said they want the job to be fun?

My boss wants me to be more independent and stop asking so many questions but also reassured me she's always happy to help. But so many times now her answers have been condescending or just something like ""What do you think?"" I don't know, that's why I'm asking! 

 I asked a question about something that had confused me last week that she had explained. It's a big important client so I wanted to make sure I got it right. When I asked she only responded with ""I explained this last week, did you forget?"" 

So because of stuff like that I feel damned if I do and damned if I don't. If I ask a question, I just am made to feel dumb and useless. If I don't and try to figure it out myself, I get it wrong and mess things up. 

I started with two other people who have now been moved to different things, still in the same department, but their jobs are way easier, even they've admitted it. So they look great and I in comparison look like a bad employee. 

There's new people who were trained a few weeks after me. They learned things I didn't. The only reason I ever know things change or information got updated is because I heard it from them. They also tend to avoid difficult work to do the easier work to get their daily goal up so I do the hard stuff and then get it wrong. And at first I was understanding because I did the same thing when I started but now it's just...a lot.

It's like I can't make mistakes at all and it feels like my boss takes it as a personal insult when I do. 

There's a lot to do and I honestly think we're severely understaffed. My boss takes her whirl home and works off the clock. So she's clearly burnt out. There's overtime offered every week and at this point it feels like an expectation to do it. We never get a thank you for doing it. We never get a thank for anything. Like I said, no positive feedback. 

Is this typical for full time jobs? Do I need to just suck it up?

TLDR: company decided to move entire department in two months and is unhappy people, including me, aren't doing the same quality and quantity as people who were there for years. All I hear is negative feedback, nothing positive. Training was rushed and now there's new info the new people know that I didn't. Questions are met with condescension. I'm struggling to meet the daily work goal. It's not great pay but it's better than retail."
"How many of you guys feel like you’re competent at your job and what type of role do you have (I.e. customer facing, data wrangling etc.)? As in....fully competent, never make mistakes?","I’m very curious how others are doing in their roles as I’ve been in my role for 3 months and am not as competent as I would like to be. Especially in the type of role I am in as a Data Analyst dealing with clients. On many occasions, while sending out reports to clients little mistakes are made that would’ve been caught if I spent significant time checking each cell in the file, however, there is no time in the world to check these files. "
Boss won't fire people,"The title says it all. We work as a team of 9 people (more or less) delivering packages across the city (it's small) by foot through an international company. We started this a year ago with a national company, and before the project really took off, 5 people left because we weren't getting paid for it at the time. Now, two other people (not part of the original team) come in, and do whatever they please (one showed up whenever she wanted, and the other just started two weeks ago), and act as if they know what they're doing when they just started. We go in teams of two people per group, and divide the packages by zone. The one who started two weeks ago is constantly trying to take charge of delivering the packages no matter who he goes with, and walks slow (too slow for us to deliver efficiently), causing us take twice as long to deliver the packages. The one who showed up whenever is no longer working with us. I was frustrated that they weren't being hard on people to work a little faster (3 hours to deliver six packages between two people in one section of the city?), and they temporarily removed me. After I was given the chance to return is when the new kid shows up depsite us being told that the reason the former co-worker was no longer with us because they were new/inexperienced with the job, and yet they bring in someone who doesn't know anything about the process, and once they did, they began taking over no matter who they accompany to deliver."
"Called in Sick, Told to come in Anyway","Hello, not sure if this is the right place to do this. I've been working at my job for 2 years now, and in the beginning I got sick a lot and would call in whenever I was. I still was a very hard worker, and many of my managers praised my hard work, and even some of the higher ups complimented my work as well. I also would come in on days off or work for hours after my scheduled shift.

So recently, just got a new manager. She worked at the store before, but was never in charge of me. Initially, we didnt like each other, but once she saw how hardworking I was, she began to like me, and same with me, for requested days off were usually approved. I've been working with her for 3 months, and during these three months I haven't called in sick once. I've also worked give overtime hours, and she has written me several times thanking me for how hard I've been working (I work at Safeway so I stock things basically and face)

One of my other managers who oversees the schedule and such, doesnt like me (which most people in the store do like me and even were shocked at some of the things hes done) There was a time he yelled at me during my first year when I needed time off after finding out my Grandma had stage 4 cancer. The past 4 days Ive been feeling very sick. I didnt want to call in because I really wanted the money for Christmas presents for my boyfriend and family, so I worked those days, not taking a lunch either on any of those days to make sure the job was finished. Today though, I felt dizzy and couldn't even get out of bed for a few hours. I've been having a very bad headache, sore throat, runny nose and cough with a heavy feeling in my chest. I'm not sure if its bronchitis or another sinus infection, just a really bad one, but I just knew if I went to work today i could potentially pass out. So, I let my manager know, she didnt say anything. Then I called the store to let them know. My schedule manager answered and instantly was annoyed and I felt terrified because I knew he might yell at me again. I told him I felt awful and was wondering I could use my sick hours for today (whenever I called out previously I never used sick hours, but this time I really didnt want to take a hit to my paycheck) he began saying ""this is the worst possible day to do this, she has to count EVERYTHING.  You can't call in you have to come in. You've been calling in a lot again."" I tried to fight back tears because I was not expecting him to tell me I couldn't, is that even possible? And I wanted to say I hadn't been calling in, in fact it had been over 3 months of solid working even overtime. But I just said okay. Hung up the phone and cried. My boyfriend told me I needed to be more firm, stand up for myself and learn to say no, but then offered to call.  I told him no, that would make things worse.

My mom also was upset, and told me he can't do that. I told her I already agreed to come in. Now I'm concerned not only will I potentially pass out from being dizzy, but also that I could get others sick.

I'm also now on the bad side of my schedule manager (let's just call him J) again, who yelled at me on the phone. I've even come to work before with a face mask on when I was very sick, just so I didnt get yelled at by him for calling in. I have a very weak immune system, have had doctors notes almost 90 percent of the time I've been sick, and they even see me coughing and having to blow my nose. 

What should I do? "
"High School Graduate - New Job, what to do, and what not to?","Hello fine folks of reddit! 
I graduated High School, and have gotten my first 9-5 job(I started last week). The  term job is suppepose to end in august, but it has been quite a rough start, and the tools and skills I have to learn ( manufacturer job) is  a lot. I feel like I have not been doing anything productive the past few days, and I do not even know if I can finish the project they set me to do. I am stressing over it after work, and cannot even seem to relax, mostly I  do not even know how to act in a job setting. Should I just quit or, is there any approach I can take to be a better co-worker?"
"Had a rough start at work, struggling and dont know what to do","&#x200B;

So here it goes,

So it's been 4 months on my first job and I've been struggling at my current work. I work in an IT company and being deployed on the client's location. I work as a business analyst, honestly I was usually a dev throughout my years in college but felt like exhausted being a dev since i also felt like I'm just mediocre to moderate as a developer, so I decided to try out becoming an analyst, just to know what it feels like and I was always curious on how it feels like becoming a business analyst even if it was outside my comfort zone. I just don't want to feel that regret of not trying out other jobs that I've been always curious of. Cause who knows, it might be the right one for me right? Anyways, before I applied to the company, I've already asked a few people who worked there, and they told me they had a good start and it was also a good start for fresh grads, good pay, proper training and the projects they had were worth the experience. So that's how I made my decision of applying there as my first job.

So when the day  came on my first day of the job, I was informed that I'll be only working with a team lead. No other teammates, the project manager's role is only to manage financials(Idk thats what they told me, but yeah cant approach them), so just a team lead. There weren't even any trainings as well. The team lead is only instructed to attend once a week for the whole day or 1 hour per day, only to give feedbacks on my outputs and to report to him whatever I did throughout the day. So, it wasnt how I expected it would be but I said to myself that it felt like it was manageable, it was a bit difficult, but yeah, still manageable. 2 months later, my team lead told me that he was going to resign and after he left everything went downhill. At first, the client told me that they were going to look for a replacement to the team lead, but in the end they said to me that they will be getting a senior BA but would be working on a different project and I will be directly reporting to the client instead.  I felt like I was just told what I should do but I'm not really feeling like I'm being trained like a BA. There was also that pressure of ""Aren't you a BA? Then you should know these things or what to do right?"". Ever since that happened, I felt like my drive of looking forward to work slowly faded away. They also keep pressuring me in a ""joking-tone-but-im-serious"" manner regarding the deadlines  of each output even though it's not my fault. The cause of delays were because of numerous meetings with several departments for feedbacks and opinions regarding the output, and they don't immediately respond if they are  going to attend the meeting so we had to keep rescheduling until they do. And currently Im just almost finished with one output out of six, and the length of the whole project is 6 months(so 1 month per output), so basically there's only 2 months left and probably they'll extend it but I feel like I cant see myself doing this 5 more times since I realized I dont like what I'm doing and I lost my drive. I also feel like I don't want to go back there anymore as I feel like everytime I go there I just lose my morale and just getting depressed. So now I started to realize and ask myself these questions:

* Is this work really meant for me or it's ridiculous for them to just leave me there alone on my first project?
* Should I ask the IT manager or HR to request to go back to becoming a dev and just try to become better at it?
* Should I tell the IT manager or HR for what I'm experiencing now and request for a different project or  request for assistance?

Need advice or opinion on how you're going to handle this situation as I don't know what to do as of now.

&#x200B;

I also actually want to know if it's normal working alone on your first job and on your first project without any training or even a mentor, and also being deployed on the client's location, and if it is okay if I suddenly ask to transfer to a different project since I don't feel that comfortable working there anymore."
How fair is it to retroactively discipline an employee for attendance?,"There’s this extremely problematic employee who happens to be one of our most productive. Part of the reason they’re one of our most productive is that they’re often mean to other people and fail to develop the skills of those around them.

This employee disrespects me and others, and I’m about done being nice. It just so happens that they’re often late and/or absent. I’ve documented their attendance infractions, but I haven’t had any conversations with them or had them sign off on the forms—a step needed for each documented incident.

The bad news, however, is that our department head doesn’t apply the attendance policy on a consistent basis. 

The head boss keeps hinting to me that they want “us,” as a management team, to write people up, but I get the impression that they’re kinda scared to apply the policy.

To be honest, I kind of am, too.

Partly because I don’t want to do the boss’s “dirty work” by writing everyone up if the boss is going to feign cluelessness to the policy. Partly because I don’t want to write the problematic employee up retroactively when I (and other managers) have been late, as well. I don’t know if my manager would suddenly, retroactively write me up, too, since our (and the company’s) numbers have been kinda bad recently, and none of us managers’ jobs are really that safe. And partly because this employee exhibits some psychopathic behavior, such as frequent triangulation of people. So I don’t want them to organize something at my expense.

So...how risky is it for me to write this person up, retroactively? Would it be fair?

This person’s attitude and character are detrimental to the team, and their presence and behaviors detract from team morale. My boss says the employee has been warned that they’re on thin ice for not having a proper attitude, and I’ve tried to support them as best I can. I feel like I’m running out of ways to help them succeed, and in a sense they’re a constant detriment to the goals of the team."
No Such Thing As Downtime,"I am a receptionist for a small business, that has a lot of family ties (upper management, week day receptionist, etc). I'm one of two receptionists that work on either Saturday or Sunday, and I'm a full time student as well. My boss chewed the weekenders out via text recently, saying that we should never be on our phone, or drawing, or doing work (not even homework) outside of the company, or even being on the internet outside of for the job. This would seem reasonable, except that we don't have a ton of things to do. We have data entry we can do (until we do it all), emails and phone to answer (until we don't have any), general cleaning (until everything has been dusted and swept and it's tidy). I understand wanting us to appear busy at all times, but if we aren't even allowed to read articles online, then what is there to do besides sit blankly?  It REALLY gets me that I can look at the computer's history and see the main receptionist (my bosses' family member) searching about healing stones and illness symptoms, but that's not something I can change.

&#x200B;

Am I in the wrong? Any suggestions, on how to deal or what to do with this downtime? "
Warnings regarding performance,"Two months ago I interviewed for a firm doing a similar job to the one I have now, but it was full-time rather than part-time. Earnings were roughly the same, but there was a clear progression pathway and an actual structure to the firm. Following an improved offer, I elected to stay at my current position, which brings us to today.

This morning I had a vague warning about my current performance - ""I'm not seeing X-value performance, if I don't I'll find an x-value employee."" I've been regretting not taking the other offer for a while now, as while it would have made me slightly worse-off in the short term, medium-term it was looking better, and now I'm looking at either losing the raise I earned for staying put, or losing the job altogether in the next ten weeks. It would be significantly cheaper for my firm to employ someone new since they wouldn't have to pay the bonuses I get each week for recruiting client schools. On the other hand, the firm is also losing two other coaches as they're moving on to pastures new, so I'm not sure if I'm in a good position or not.

Apart from looking elsewhere as I have been, what can I do to help save my skin? I'm sure when I sit down and think about it calmly I'll be able to identify one or two things I can do a little better but at the moment I'm feeling a little bit sick.

NB: My role is technically self-employed so I don't have any of the usual"

Manager tried to make me choose if i wanted to fire his brother or not.,"So long story short me and my manager havent been seeing eye to eye. His brother used to work for the company but quit and he decided to hire him back when our other delivery driver got fired. He told me the complete opposite of what his brother is and i absoloutely hate working with him. Last week his brother got caught smoking weed right in front of the store... Yes i know hes an idiot. The manager which again is his brother calls me into his office and tries to make me make the decision on whether or not he should escalate the problem to head office. I just straight up told him "" if it was me id be fired instantly, you are the manager and this is your decision not mine"". He then said he wouldnt fire me and made me write up a statement of what happened the day his brother got caught. Is this unprofessional of him and should i let the higher ups know he tried to pin it off on me? Or do i just let it go."
Can I be fired for my super gay Youtube channel?,"I just accepted my first job offer, and it's an entry level social media gig at a big company. I have a Youtube channel that I have never mentioned during interviews, and I use a pseudonym (same first name, different last name) on the channel. I've never mentioned it because I talk about things that are very personal to me. Most of my videos are about my sexual orientation, and the ups and downs I've had in accepting myself. I don't use profanity during these videos, but sometimes I'm drinking a glass of wine or saying something that someone ultra conservative might not approve of.

I'm worried that if my company ever discovers this channel, they'll fire me or make me delete my channel and stop filming. Or that someone homophobic might watch me and send my videos to my boss to get me fired. I would never mention my company in my videos, and I do not reveal any personal information that could indicate to any of my subscribers of who I am and where I live. Youtube is not only my passion and a great way to get out my thoughts, but it's also my side hustle, and I'm able to make a decent amount of money from it so I really don't want to lose it. But I also don't want to lose my job. "

How do you know if you’ve been put on a PIP?,"I got promoted to assistant manager of a failing sales team at the end of last fiscal quarter.

Our district manager was supposed to train me, but for whatever reason he didn’t. So instead our general manager did, with the rationale being that the GM used to be a DM. Kinda weird but whatever.

Sales still suck, and the quarter is almost over.

So today my district manager came in and told me our sales are bad, and he gave me a chart to track my sales. He says he wants me to improve my sales by basically 10% in the next six weeks. He asked me what I think is keeping the team from higher sales, and we brainstormed some things to help raise sales.

He didn’t say what would happen if I don’t.

I’m kinda taken aback and unsure of how to interpret all of this. I barely even got promoted.

A lot of the powerful people in the company seem to like me (VPs, DMs, etc.)...except for the territory manager, who is just above district manager but below VP. The territory manager is friendly with me, but when I observe closely, I can tell something is off in how he reacts to my presence.

Our hierarchy is like: Founders>VPs>Territory Manager>District Managers>General Managers>Assistant Managers>Shift Managers"
How to handle a coworker who thinks he is management?,"We got this new employee who was hired as temp to hire. He has been there for about a month, he is a serious ass kisser and within a couple days we realized he is a snitch as well. 

He has gotten in tight with the supervisor and now acts like he is part of management. Many others are really annoyed with him as well but it seems he really has something against me.  If I leave the room, he will question the others about where I went. If I am running an operation in another part of the building, he will question others why I am taking long to do the task. He will show up out of nowhere to i guess ""check on me"" at my work station and made a point to lay eyes on my laptop to see what I was doing. 

Also, If I am on my phone he will complain to others about why I am on the phone. If I am 10 minutes late to work, he will complain to others about my tardiness. I was out of work for 2 days because my kids school got cancelled due to weather and he was complaining to others that i miss too many days of work when it was literally the only 2 days I missed since he was there lol

I am not sure why he has targeted me but I am going to assume its because I am the defacto group leader (without the title) and he wants to be the man.

I work for a California based tech company and we have a really relaxed and laid back culture and work environment and this dude is killing the vibe.

People Management?,"I recently freelanced at a company that had a Director of People, as well as HR. Since then, I've come across a contact sharing a job post for a VP of People.

What is this job? Is this some crazy new BS title? Why does this title sound so icky?"
How to be less stressed/on edge at work?,"Hi all,

So I am returning to my summer job in a few days, at which my anxiety is returning at full force. Little context: I work at an architecture firm where I'd like to think I am a valued employee (have received compliments about my progress, been given raises, etc). But it is a huge field with lots of drawings/contractors/knowledge that are prone to mistakes.

Basically my fear comes from making mistakes and being disciplined - basically the idea of being given responsibility and letting others down or being punished and being at fault. It's to the point where all day I am constantly shaking in fear of messing up or worrying about the next new task I'll be given and whether or not I will be able to figure it out or mess up royally. I just know if something happened I'd feel so very ashamed and upset at myself. Now my bosses are not bad people and they are not the cause of my anxiety I believe, as it is more internal attributions that cause these feelings. They have never directly given me cause to think that any mess up by me would result in a yelling session or an immediate firing.

Do you have any ideas on how to change my way of thinking that this is simply something I do for money rather than a 9 hour fight-or-flight panic attack for survival? It almost is part of my identity and that if something bad happened that I could never recover or it would be life-changing. My ego is so afraid of looking dumb or letting down others that I am a perfectionist and cannot accept any less, otherwise the worst might happen. I'm always looking busy because I'm afraid of getting a new task which I have a new opportunity to fail.

Thank you all very much and have a lovely day."
"(US) New manager made multiple inappropriate comments regarding my health, and misc. other things. How should I proceed? [xpost from askHR]","So this is going to be a long post, but I want to make sure I explain the entire situation in hopes that I can get some opinions on what my next steps should be.

I'm in the US btw.

I'll start off with explaining that I was hired 3 years for position A. Hiring manager, and my reporting manager were incredible! One of the best things about this job was that they offered complete flexibility on working from home as needed, and there was no hard start-time. 

I was blessed with some great genes.

One being asthma since birth... which sometimes leads to pneumonia during the colder months. And the other is my kidney disease... which brings kidney stones, and causes me to be frequented with gout flare-ups. Whenever I have a gout flare-up, it'll last anywhere from 2 days, to 3-4 weeks. During which, I have a really tough time walking, sometimes not even being able to put a shoe on. So the job I took had to be completely flexible with working from home as necessary.

It also offered me the flexibility to help my in-laws (who are retired and disabled), and be home with my elderly dog when necessary. It was one of the main reasons I took the job. And I fell in love with this job. More and more every day. Was thriving in my role, and was working with some very awesome co-workers. First year review was great - 4/5 (and he noted he never gives out 5s. there's always room to improve, but couldn't really think of anything in particular with me. Raise #1 was alright. Didn't expect much, as it was my first year with the company.

Shortly after the first year, my then-manager mentioned that there was another team in need of someone with my skill-set and he thought it'd be a great fit as they were really in need of the help. He moved me to the new team, and I was situated with a new manager. Manager 2 was extremely supportive in furthering my career goals, and we clicked really well. Meetings with him were a blast, we'd geek out about technology for an hour+. Working with the new team during my 2nd year was great. I was learning more skills, and my opinion was being asked by department heads, on various important decisions. 

My 2nd year review was again, great. 4.5/5. Said that I should spend time writing more tests, and possibly get into automation if I ever wanted to chase a 5. The others on my team all have a different job title than me. They all went towards being full-stack developers, whereas I went more of the front-end UX/UI focus route. It's where my passion is, and is something I'm able to contribute to fully. Raise #2 was better than the first... and was on par with the work I was completing. No complaints about anything I did. Whenever I, or anybody on the team needed to work from home, it was perfectly okay. He knew we were all working, and that ""we're all adults here."" Treated us all like grownups, and showed us that respect. Something neat that this manager did, was introduce a 'completely optional learning objective', where we could choose to learn something new... to encourage us to keep learning. You could take time during the work-day to do this, too. If you chose to do it, it'd be noted on your annual review, and was something you could choose to demonstrate to the department heads. I was actually excited to do this. Did a learning objective to further my knowledge in a front-end programming language. Built a dummy site. It was small, but I learned a ton. But the important thing to remember here was that he helped get me excited about it.

Fast forward a half a year, and manager 2 got a job with a different company. Our team was given a new (much less experienced) manager... Manager 3. This is where things started going downhill. I'm sorry if I ramble on with any of this. I've never been so angry and sad about something like this.

So from the very beginning, there wasn't that great vibe, or connection I had with my previous managers. Manager 3 was constantly over-involving themselves in every meeting, and all of our planning (which isn't something any of the previous managers did.) The micro-management was obvious. Constantly asking how to get us to produce more work, ignoring the fact that we've been over-delivering for the past 2 years. Completely disregarding the work that we complete, and just constantly looking for more, more, more. Culture/Personality mismatch... 100%.

Manager 3 they started over-doing the individual meetings with us. Remember that 'completely optional learning objective' that manager 2 started? Manager 3 started pushing this as something that we should do... while continuing to call it 'optional'. Totally turned me off to wanting to do it... because not only was Manager 3 pushing this previously optional thing as a soft-requirement, they would tell you what they think you should do for it. Manager 3 wanted me to learn server-side coding, so I could become a full-stack developer, so I could ""contribute to more work"" - as if my days weren't already slammed packed with other work. So I say that I'm not interested in the optional learning objective, and that most of my days are already packed with work. Manager 3 also started speaking up during the personal meetings about wanting people to not working from home as much. I explained that some days I need to work from home for 'medical reasons', and it was something that I, and the company agreed to when I took this job.

During her first 6 months, I'm involved on multiple things, from UI wire-framing, to finishing stories for features, to resolving defects. Lead the entire design, and wire-frame process for multiple key features on a product we frequent. This was something I thought would be notable for a great review. Wouldn't you guess... Manager 3 gave me a god damn 3/5, and under critical notes explained that I didn't opt into doing the optional learning objective. I also got a smaller raise than I had in previous years. 

All and all, this review was a complete slap in the face to all of the hard work I put in, and money I both made for the company, and saved the company by reducing the amount of resources necessary in the design/mockup process. It didn't discourage me to the point of not working... I was really just disappointing that it was completely ignored. 

The next ~3 months, continued doing similar work, and manager 3 was constantly making comments about the team not working from home as much. Mind you, this isn't a company policy that they were trying to enforce. And sometimes, people are actually unable to make it into work due to health reasons. We're human.

Another month passes, and this is where things get very... inappropriate. This was around the time where we began working on strictly server-side code for a project. Something that I explained that I'm not at all experienced in. I explained that I'd work alongside other developers, and hopefully learn as we go by observing. It wasn't realistic that I'd learn an entire programming language all while also owning and completing stories. I didn't say this, but it's worth mentioning that none of said language, or skill set was described in my job description... and that work was way above my pay-grade.

So I end up catching pneumonia... which completely knocked me off my feet with Thanksgiving just a week away. Had to go to the ER as I couldn't breathe. Asthma going crazy. It was awful. At that point, I had been out sick for 5 days... when I all of a sudden get an email to come in for a personal meeting the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I'm still sick at this point, so I angrily get dressed, and go in for said meeting.

Manager goes and asks how I'm doing, and follows that up with a discussion about how ""I know you've been sick, but I really need you to be contributing more for this feature..."" I'm dumbfounded at this point. The nerve to even say something like this... I explained that I'm still very much sick, have ER/doctors notes if necessary. But working while having pneumonia is just about the craziest thing I've ever heard. I explained that it sometimes takes people weeks to fully get over it. 

I don't think it's at all appropriate for a manager to make any comment about any illness, infection, or disease. If there was any policies, or company rules broken, then that needs to be addressed. But I hadn't broken any. I had sick time, and was using it as needed. I left after the meeting, still sick. Luckily had the two-day Thanksgiving break, and weekend to fight it off.

Got the news late Wednesday night that my grandfather passed away. that was miserable. Funeral/wake on Friday.

We still had Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday as planned. Never having eaten turkey on Thanksgiving as an adult, for whatever reason, I did this year. And boy, do I regret that decision entirely. Turns out, turkey is loaded with purines and is incredibly bad for people who suffer from gout. 

OH JOY! The next morning, my entire foot was swollen... and I couldn't put any pressure on it. At all. I've never had gout flareup the entire foot before, normally just effects my toe. I stubbornly tried ignoring it at first, limped down the street walking the dogs. I knew as soon as I got back in that I was very much doomed for the foreseeable future, with easily one of the worst gout flareups I've ever experienced. Here I am, pneumonia-gout ridden. I'm a total mess at this point. Couldn't put my shoe on, couldn't walk, couldn't do much at all. 

Luckily by late Saturday/early Sunday, the antibiotics finally killed my pneumonia. Unfortunately for me, my arch nemesis gout, remained with me. Sunday night the pain got so bad, I had to go to the ER. I was there until 6am on Monday... and a round of anti-inflammatory pills. After spending the entire previous night at the ER, I had to take another sick day on Monday. But emailed in that I'd be working from home on Tuesday ('for medical reasons'). Still suffering from the flareup, I worked from home the rest of the week. I made sure to participate in every meeting, and make my presence known. I wanted to make sure it was apparent I was working.

So that takes us to today. I finally made it back into the office! Had a semi-swollen toe, but it wasn't nearly as painful. Manager schedules another personal meeting with me, right after our morning team meetings. We get into the meeting and immediately felt the negative mood shift. Manager asks 'if I'm doing any better' (different tone than them previously asking how I was doing.) Then again, immediately going into their concerns over the past few weeks, and how I haven't shown any improvement.

I bluntly just looked at her, and explained that I've had pneumonia, gout and a death in the family all in the last month. Explained again that if necessary, I'd have doctors notes, to which they replied ""not necessary."" I explained that when I have a gout flareup, I'm unable to walk. Which means, I'm unable to safely drive. I'm able to sit in a chair at home and work from home without problem though. Manager replied ""I didn't know that's why you were working from home last week, you should have told me... but you still need to make an effort to make it into the office more."" I replied, that ""as long as I'm able to successfully work, it's wildly inappropriate to even suggest that I email my specific medical status."" I then asked if I should go speak to HR regarding my kidney disease, and work with them in allowing me to work from home as I need to... manager replied that ""we could both go and talk with them together.""

I've just about had it at this point. I have a kidney disease that I know one day will eventually kill me. And this manager is basically saying that coming into the office is more important than my comfort.

So I guess my question is:

Do I speak with HR regarding this? Or do I go directly above the manager's head to their manager? How would I approach HR, without this setting off landmines and losing my job over escalating this. What protections do I have legally (if any)?

Sorry for the long post... any advice would be greatly appreciated.



**TL/DR**:
Worked for current company for a little over 3 years. Took job because of the 'flexible work environment' which allowed me to work from home as needed. I have kidney disease, and pretty bad asthma. The kidney disease causes me to get gout frequently, and the asthma is just something I have to cope with during the cold months. When I have a bad gout flareup, I can't walk at all. First two managers let me work from as needed, treated me as an adult. New manager is fussing over me not getting as much done due to me being out sick.

Actual quotes: 

> ""I know you've been sick, but I really need you to be contributing more for this feature...""

...

> ""I didn't know that's why you were working from home last week, you should have told me... but you still need to make an effort to make it into the office more."" 

Very inappropriate, and overstepped my boundaries. Looking for advice on how to approach HR with this."
My general manager is becoming increasingly abusive and I have a phone call scheduled with our district manager to discuss it. Advice on approaching this conversation and actually getting results?,"I'll start this off saying that I've missed 4 days of work in the past month. Two of those were because I urgently needed to complete homework for college midterms, 2 were for mental health. During that week I was also scheduled about 47 hours even though I'm a part time employee (usually about 20-25 hours) and have never agreed to that many hours. I asked my manager if I could drop or swap my shifts and he laughed at me and said no. I've been struggling a bit and honestly I was at my breaking point, I don't normally miss work often at all (I've worked at my store for over a year) and I don't take it lightly. 

I also have recently been switched to a state insurance plan which is not free as it was last year, but requires co-pays for each appointment and prescription. Primary care appointments aren't too expensive but ER visits and psychiatrist visits have been costing me about $100. So I haven't brought a note from my psychiatrist to excuse my absences, and frankly I feel extremely uncomfortable even discussing mental health issues with my boss, but I'll get to that shortly.

A lot of employees have had issues with this GM for a long time and several reports to upper management have been made, usually resulting in a slap on the wrist. He almost never completes the weekly schedule on the day he promises to, he makes his assistant managers do almost all of his work for him (including signing important documents, for which they have a stamp with his signature on it), and he is notoriously rude and immature. He talks about how great at his job he is and how he knows how to make employees act how he wants them to, but truthfully almost no one respects him because he's so blatantly lazy and unprofessional.

Over the last couple of months my store has had two imperfect mystery shopper reports and my boss has been furious and constantly borderline yelling at employees, especially supervisors. He's been tightening policies, removing job perks (free items we previously were allowed, which is not a big deal but is obviously more punishment oriented than disciplinary), and threatening to fire people left and right. Every supervisor is scared of being demoted. One girl was just named employee of the month and she was also threatened with demotion for making a mistake this weekend.

All of our employees have been extremely on edge and unhappy, and I've heard most of our best employees mention looking for other jobs. Yesterday I walked by the managers office and overheard him yelling at our head supervisor, cussing and telling him that he better get people in line because ""these little shits are starting to piss me off"".

I'm a supervisor myself and I've worked hard this past year to get where I am and be great at my job. It's a lower wage hourly job so it's not the American dream or anything, but for a long time it was a great place for me to be while I'm in college.

Because of these unexcused absences, I've received 2 write ups, which resulted in me getting suspended for a week. I missed my shift today. I spoke to an assistant manager about it and was then called back by my general manager. He immediately began yelling at me and told me I must not care about my job and that I needed to prove to him that I do care, and then hung up on me while I was trying to explain to him why I missed my shift.

Let me emphasize that I truly do understand the importance of coming to work and being reliable, and I've always taken pride in my ability to do that. Literally just since early March have I begin slipping for the first time, and I've apologized and taken responsibility each time. I didn't complain when I was written up, and I didn't try to make excuses even given that my mental health has been in bad shape. But he is demanding an explanation and has sent an additional write up for me to our HR department. He told me to come in Monday if I want to make a statement to explain myself, but said that he can't really see how a piece of paper is going to help me.

My workplace has become so toxic and everyone is so unhappy, when he spoke to me so disrespectfully today I truly considered going in tomorrow and turning in my written two week notice. But I don't have other employment yet, and I honestly do care about my coworkers and the fact that they are clearly being used and abused by someone who has no idea how to actually run the place without throwing tantrums. I emailed my district manager and explained the general situation and asked that he call me tomorrow.

How can I approach this conversation in a way that's professional but doesn't gloss over how toxic my manager is? Truthfully, at this point I want this guy to get fired. He's a terrible manager and he's turning our store into a miserable place. I really want to see some kind of actual result come of this, and I'm honestly really nervous about going in on Monday because I know he's going to try to downplay any explanation I have and make me feel worse.


Tl;Dr
My boss is increasingly toxic and abusive, has never been reliable or good at his job, and is now constantly threatening employees with write ups and demotions over minor mistakes, calling it ""insubordination"". I've been absent several times recently, which I acknowledge is not okay and I take responsibility for, but he's being so openly disrespectful and belligerent about it that I don't feel comfortable coming to him to explain my mental health issues. I have a meeting to speak with my district manager, how can I handle this productively?"
How to deal with a Negative Coworker???,"I've been working at {place} for about a year now, my co-worker and I are ""friends"" but she's probably the most toxic person I've ever met. She complains about literally everything, calls in sick atleast once a week, tells me I do ""nothing"", makes unnecessary comments towards me like ""ew, never wear your hair like that again"", acts like she's the manager (and makes sure everybody knows it too) , makes everyone try to feel sympathetic towards her, and she talks shit about everyone behind everyones back. How do I deal with this on a day to day basis? She's the type of person if I confront her she is going to be passive aggressive and snobby... (other people have left the position because of her) :( I hate this, going to work everyday is toxic."
Feeling Paranoid About Losing New Job,"So I got hired at my new job as a marketer and I have been here for a month. I do my work to the best of my ability, the coworkers are nice, the boss took me and a few coworkers out to a few lunches and a dinner. The boss thanked me for joining their team and appreciated the work that I put in. But sometimes I feel like I'm not putting in a lot of work, I ask a lot of questions sometimes when I'm stuck ( For some I realized the answer was right in front of me but it was too late), and I feel like I don't know much but my coworkers are patient. This is the first good job that I received out of college and I am really fearful of losing it."
Tips for work ethic improvement?,"Recently I have found myself struggling with my nosediving work ethic in the office.....since 2016. After getting a standard Good Ol' American 9-5 Office Gig, I've been lazy and unmotivated in my work day. It's a frustrating and embarrassing realization as new ""rules"" are put into place for myself and my colleague to follow due to my inability to pick up the slack. Tasks and assignments fall my the wayside as I cannot see the urgency or even the reason for doing them. Little stuff like....printing copies or sending out an email blast. I'm an admin, so I do basic little stuff.

I don't know how to describe it other than I am completely un-invested in the work that I do. My job previous to this, I did lots of physical work such as packaging, counting, moving, and all around handling products. I was involved in meetings and discussions but the overall physicality of movement and sensation of *doing something* kept my mind sharp and heart happy.  

I'm worried that if my work ethic continues to landslide I'll struggle to find and enjoy any job. I can't quit, because of bills and a somewhat high col area and any jobs I search for just seem to be different versions of office-related Hell. I struggle with what I want my career to be due to feeling so far behind in life as is (26, shit degree, lots of time wasted, no valuable skills, etc)

There's many things I want to do, apply for certifications and start a freelance writing gig but my job has totally destroyed my self esteem and mental happiness to the point where everything is a big ""why bother."" I can't seem to find motivation, inspiration, heck even *joy* in anything. 

What's the way to fix this? Books, meditation, working out and yoga? How do I take that first plunge and start myself on the long path toward a better work ethic and an overall happier life? Most of all how do I care about working again? "
"So I really fucked up at work after working here a year, I owned up to it and am still scared of the consequences","As the title says I made a mistake that basically impacted a few projects for a client of my company’s and I owned up to it immediately. I explained myself and how this was done when I was still fairly new and didn’t know as much, etc. because it did happen when I was new and not as well versed in things. 

Anyway, I’m still worried about all this because it’s a big fuck up but didn’t get the sense from my boss that it’s a fireable thing. I’m just trying to stay calm and not worry much about it but in the back of my head I’m obviously panicking. How should I deal with this? I’m not playing any blame game or anything and I owned up to it without playing dumb so I think I have some points for that at least. "

Timeline:

1. Over 5 years: complete as many personal projects, textbooks (full comprehension), and research papers as possible. Get experience with Tensorflow, PyTorch, R, Python w/ Scikit-learn, SQL and noSQL. Apply for a Master's degree in Machine Learning Fall 2023.
2. Over 1 year: study the Deep Learning Book and take a free online course (i.e., Andrew Ng's course using the Python/sklearn GitHub repo). Continue work on personal projects.
3. Over 2 years: Start my Master's degree at a great out of state university using my savings and learn everything I can on Measure Theory, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistics, Transfer Learning and a Specialization like Computer Vision. Work a part time job at night, spend 30 to 40 hours a week on studying/homework and spend 20 to 30 hours a week on research with a PI. Do an internship over the summer.
4. Over 1 year: Continue working a part time night job and experiment with freelance/consulting to pay loans. Take six graduate math courses non-degree (Complex  Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Stochastic Calculus, Information Theory, Measure Theoretic Probability Theory), and focus on more research with a new PI.
5. Consider Applying for PhD programs in growing, marketable, technologically focused fields with sparse available talent while seriously looking at my value to industry with just a Master's degree in Machine Learning. Get at most 3 years work experience before I make the decision.

Concerns and Questions 1:

1. First, this idea works on paper (I really like it) and matches the time that I currently use for things like chores, cooking and sleep. However, this is a 70 hour work week for 9 years, and I don't know if I can handle that. The best thing that I can do is try.

Concerns and Questions 2:

1. Second, the 8 books comprise about 4000 readable pages. I have a maximum of 5215 hours to study over five years if I only work 40 hours a week, don't take breaks, study during 14 days PTO, and don't study during my commute. However, I will realistically only have 40 minutes average per page to fully comprehend the material and solve a significant amount of problems. I do not know if that is enough time. 
2. I can probably partially alleviate (1) by creatively using my academic paper time, and by skipping all or parts of a book(s).

What do you think about this schedule and my two concerns? Am I over planning my goals? How do you think I should approach my goals? Is this realistic?"
Call center / service desk employees -- how leveraged do you feel is 'over-leveraged'?,"I work at a large corporation that provides great benefits and decent pay (for my locale anyhow).

Originally, I was hired on to work on their internal IT helpdesk.  While it was still crappy call-center-esque phone and email support, I still enjoyed the work because I got to talk to a lot of people, troubleshoot issues, and had a lot of autonomy to work on solutions to problems.

Over the past couple of years, though, the department has really gone down hill and has started implementing some really miserable policies (strictly scheduled lunches and breaks, metrics, 60 second wrap-up time, etc).  But we also started taking on many new external contracts -- and many of these contracts each have their very own SOP.  Some clients, besides having their own SOP, have multiple projects under them, and each project may even be handled different.  They are also all *white label*, and many of them are angry assholes (unlike internal employees).

An example would be that one client requires that we open a ticket in one ticketing system, while another requires us to use another ticketing system, except we close that ticket and then send an email.  Another might require us to some combination of steps, while yet another has two completely different SOPs depending on the time of day.  In fact, multiple clients have their own operating hours, and none of them are standardized.  There is no training, either -- we just get an email from management going, ""Hey!  New THING is going live today!  Here's a KB article!""

I spend more time digging for KB articles in three different knowledgebase systems to check for proper 'procedure' than I do fixing an issue -- even when I already know what the problem is and how to technically fix it.  I am not even exaggerating here -- my average call handling time has gone from 2 minutes to over 14 minutes.  I literally spend 10+ minutes just figuring out how to route and document the call because I'm not allowed to do that post-call.

&#x200B;

I feel like we're getting over-leveraged, and I'm tempted to approach management about it and try to think of some solutions to suggest.  But I'm also wondering if I'm just being lazy or am not coping well with change -- is this normal in a call center environment?

I work in three different ticketing systems and have so many clients that I actually can't name them all -- I think it's around 25-30, many of which have between 2-6 sub-projects -- and I manage 15 different email boxes.  I can't always depend on ""whispers"", because many callers will dial into a generic IVR and mash '0' immediately and then just expect me to know who they are and what it is they are talking about.  We're also the ""roll over"" for other service desks.

&#x200B;

**The point:**  *So -- sanity check -- is this all really over-the-top or am I just getting too old for this shit?  Should I suggest trying to dedicate agents to different projects?*

"I was given an end of year bonus, but also put on performance improvement plan?","I work at a small company with around 7 people, I've been working here for almost a year. Yesterday, the owner gave me an end of year bonus, but also said that there are a lot of things I need to learn, and that I would be put on a ""program"" which I assume is a performance improvement plan? 

I've been reading online, it looks like if you are put on a performance improvement plan, it basically means that they are preparing to fire you?

Can someone help me interpret this situation?

What is wrong with not wanting responsibility?,"A person not wanting this still help with the work that is given, still report for as long as 8hrs a day, not get paid doing nothing just that they are doing it in support style instead of carry frontline. But to the company eye when they hire a person like that they feel that they made a wrong decision which I am not getting as they still helped out no matter how you look at it. They get viewed as someone who are getting paid to do nothing or lazy and negative impression."
"I want to fire an employee, but cannot.","I want to fire this employee (call her ""Mary"") because:

* Failed our key benchmark for staff by a wide margin.
* Reckless behavior.  Has been responsible for 5 accidents and at least twice as many near-misses.
* Generally poor attitude.  Does less than the minimum amount of work and bad mouths the company routinely.
* Minimal skills and unwillingness/inability to advance.  Hired for an entry level position and never advanced in 7 years.
* For the reasons above, and others reasons I have not mentioned here, I am certain Mary is not going to ever improve.

Additionally, I am certain she has been building a case for work comp and/or disability or some form of harassment, even though somehow she has avoided serious injury (in spite of her recklessness) and we have never been anything less than completely professional in dealing with her.

I have wanted to fire Mary for a very long time, but because I am only 1 of 3 managers that would need to sign off on this decision it has not happened.  The other two managers recognize Mary is an awful employee, yet they choose to not deal with it because Mary's personal situation is especially bad and they believe it would be cruel to let her go.  They are hoping she will retire ""soon"" and the problem will take care of itself.

Mary is single, 62 years old, cares for her severely disabled brother, lives close to the edge financially and, given the weak job market in our area, there is zero chance she will earn comparable pay or benefits without relocating 200+ miles.

I have been contemplating a strong-arm approach to the other two managers to force a decision, though I am contemplating if they might be more willing to accept a compromise (reduced hours?).

Any advice on how to deal with Mary?

\[EDIT\] Mary has a few notes on her performance issues in her personnel file (though there should be many more)."
Advice on how to keep a fast food job. My low self esteem has gotten me a warning from my boss,"I'm currently in the trial period for an entry level job at a fast food. Never worked this field before but i'm motivated and ready to give myself 100% in it as it finances my future. But my self esteem is so low right now that my boss has talked to me about the returns he had so far, how i'm uneased with lots of customers and the other workes constantly have to tell me what to do. 

On that latter point, i disagreed. For example they are telling me there are plates to bring, but i saw them. I'm just finishing what i'm currently doing before taking them to the customer. I'm always keeping an eye on every station in case there is something that needs to be done, but i'm still slow as i'm more focused on doing things properly rather than quickly rn. 

I feel like shit right now, if i lose this job i will have nothing left to do during the summer. Plus there will be the humiliating fact of not having been able to keep an entry level job.

I4m at a loss. What should i do ? How can i improve my social skills and have the self esteem needed to actually say what i need to say and do what i need to do quicker ?

Thanks you for your answers. I'm ready to give any other info in the comments if needed."
"Coworker did not get fired, but was ""laid off"" because the company feared a lawsuit. Is this common?","My coworker had been caught deliberately falsifying his time sheets, driving Uber during work, over-billing clients, and other infractions which I thought would warrant my company, an engineering firm, firing him for cause. It got so bad that our client wouldn't even let him work on their contracts anymore. 

My company eventually fired him for ""lack of available work,"" which is BS because they were attempting to hire a new employee around the same time they fired him. Another coworker told me that they couldn't outright fire him for cause because they feared he would sue the company for discrimination or favoritism. This could have been the perception if we hired someone right after he was fired. This decision apparently came from our company's general counsel. 

The employee that was fired was African American and had been heard muttering about how the company was racist at the client's office. But the local office of my company has 17 employees, three of which are African Americans, two of whom have been there for almost 10 years.  While I can't say conclusively that there isn't any racism in our office, I personally have found no evidence of it. However, I could find plenty of evidence of the fired coworker's infractions. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Coworker was effectively laid off instead of fired because there was a risk he would sue for discrimination. 

&#x200B;

Which leads me to the following questions: 

1. Is it more common to lay off employees than fire them because of the risk of legal retaliation? 
2. How could an employer fire a POC for cause if they could always claim racism or discrimination was the reason for  their firing? 
3. How can an employer hire someone to replace an employee who should be fired if the hiring of someone new is retroactive evidence of favoritism or discrimination? 

&#x200B;"
The company won't get rid of this problem employee for some reason - why?,"I'm about 1.5 months into a temp-to-hire position through an agency. I like the client company and have hit my minimum hours threshold to get hired on (250 hours). I started in one department and got moved over to another department (I guess you could say 'promoted' in a sense). I like everything about the job except for my team lead in that new department. My department has only two employees and the lead. She comes in bitter and in a dreadful mood every single morning. She always has an attitude all throughout the day and her moods flip from minute to minute all day long. One minute she's laughing and the next she's screaming and cussing at somebody. Most of the people in the entire place can't work with her and have before - they didn't last long around her and asked to be moved, citing that they can't work with her and she's too hard to get along with. A lot of temps have come and gone under her. I'm told that I have been there the longest. Most describe her as like working with the devil. She's double-minded, will tell you to do something one way one minute and the next she'll turn on you and tell you that it wasn't the right way. She will try to say that you shouldn't listen to what others tell you because they'll stab you in the back, but she actually will do the same thing. When she makes a mistake, she plays it off and blames others. If others make a mistake, she rants and cusses at them. You can hear her screaming all over the warehouse. She frequently says she doesn't care what other departments do, but she spends her entire day ranting about the lead in the department next to us and saying stuff like, ""I wish she would shut up, I don't want to hear her voice.""  She's petty for every little thing, ridiculously OCD and thinks she's better/smarter than everyone else. She frequently says that other people ""don't have any common sense"" and the stuff she does doesn't make sense most of the time. She does things her way and backwards. Half of her shelves are not labeled properly and she expects employees to go by memory. If they don't remember, she gets mad at them. I figure that she also keeps a grip on that department by acting like she's the only one who can do it. I'm told that she has been there for a couple of years and has previously worked in a number of other departments. She insists that others call her ""queen"" (I won't do it and a number of employees won't) even though that's obviously not her name. She convinced somebody to change her time clock name to that, as well. I'm not sure why even the managers call her by that nickname. She's a low-level team lead and on the bottom in regards to management.

We have a new employee and I have been trying to tell him stuff and show him stuff to train him. She doesn't want me to help him. Doesn't want me and him to talk at all, but she'll stand there and rattle her head off to people all day. If she sees us being happy or getting along, she tries to basically interrupt and break it up with her sourness. She is so petty that when I clocked out one day and was waiting for my ride in the break room, she thought she'd stand there in the break room and make sure that anyone else didn't say anything bad to me about her. I told her that I am my own person and I don't have time for that nonsense. She's just a huge mess. Not sure if she's bipolar or what.

Nobody seems to know the ""why"" as to why she is so hard to get along with. The kicker is that a lot of the employees who claim she's hard to work with and won't work with her - they want to date her/sleep with her. They leer at her and kind of make advances at her all day, yet at the same time act like she's an awful person to be around. One coworker literally told me that she's hard to get along with because she's not sleeping with a man. I find that very hard to believe. I know that she's dating a man who was fired a while back (he was my coworker and part of a few people associated with theft from the company).

I can't see any specific link to her and anyone in upper management. They ""know"" her as an employee, but I see nothing personal. She doesn't seem to be anyone's favorite, for instance. I don't know why they keep her. At the end of the day when we're done in our department, she is also so petty that she tries to keep us from helping out (for the overtime) in other departments. I would do it anyway because I need the money and she's no longer my team lead when we're done in our department. I have even seen her ranting at my manager and my manager's manager. I don't understand it. Why won't they get rid of her?

I discussed how hard she is to get along with with a couple of managers. One of them told me, ""Yeah, queen...we've all tried to 'tame' her..."" and acted like nobody could do anything with her. They're managers for crying out loud. Every other lead says the same, too. That she's hard to get along with and that they can't work with her. What would be the liability in this case? Are they scared of a lawsuit? Scared of her somehow? I see no dirt that she could have on anyone. I'm hoping to eventually move to another department. For now, I let her insults and such go in one ear and out of the other. When I ignore her and laugh, it seems to hurt her even more. She wants someone to argue with her, it seems. While doing your job, she'll say that you ""missed"" something in the area that you're in and you haven't even had a freaking chance to get it yet. It seems to be a bug tactic. She does that all day long. ""You missed this, you missed that"" to both me and my coworker. The last coworker stopped coming in to work."
"Really behind at dream job and it's been weeks, should I work with my team's manager to fix it or fix it myself?","**TL;DR** See title, but it's been a year since I started, and weeks since things have been going wrong. Anything else to remedy current situation would be greatly appreciated.

I’m nearing a year into my first job, my dream job. I’ve been working after hours every weekday and weekend for weeks to try to fix multiple mistakes that I've made over the last few weeks.

* I’ve accidentally abandoned projects before finishing them,
* had projects have their scope change drastically out of nowhere that I had to redo,
* had to redo projects because I made some bad decisions with them,
* have a backlog of necessary updates that grows faster than I can finish them,
* and I’m having a hard time keeping up.

It feels like I’m not seeing the forest for the trees with the amount of suggestions and changes that my work has to go through before it’s either approved or worked on. It’s almost like I have no idea what I’m doing, and on certain projects that's definitely the case.

My mentor coworker on my team wants me to work on it without announcement. That would be fine if other teams didn't need my incomplete projects to be finished and I don't know how to complete these incomplete projects. Thankfully, I've avoided that embarrassment until now, but I'm afraid it won't last. 

Living in fear that my incompetence becomes more than just a verbal, unwritten complaint; but I feel too paralyzed and embarrassed to say anything about it, especially since it won't affect just me but my mentor as well, since he's responsible for my cultivation.

**What exactly should I do?**

* Should I go over every project and what went wrong with them, and then provide a plan and timeframe for how to get each one done, even if it’ll hinder my colleagues (but what if they tell upper management who thinks I'm doing fantastic)?
* Should I only go over the ones I know I can't get done in time (but what if priorities change out of nowhere)?
* Should I speak with my mentor again to try to convince him otherwise?
* Or should I just stay silent and hope that I can pull things together without anyone noticing?
* Or maybe they have noticed but are waiting for me to say something about it?
* Are there any other things or methods I can put into action to help prevent something like this from ever happening again?"
Show up on time-Anthony Bourdain,"*If you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).*

“Show up on time. I learned this from the mentor who I call Bigfoot in Kitchen Confidential. If you didn’t show up 15 minutes exactly before your shift—if you were 13 minutes early—you lost the shift, you were sent home. The second time you were fired. It is the basis of everything. 

I make all my major decisions on other people based on that. Give the people you work with or deal with or have relationships with the respect to show up at the time you said you were going to. And by that I mean, every day, always and forever. Always be on time. It is a simple demonstration of discipline, good work habits, and most importantly respect for other people. 

As an employee, it was a hugely important expression of respect, and as an employer, I quickly came to understand that there are two types of people in this world: There are the type of people who are going to live up to what they said they were going to do yesterday, and then there are people who are full of shit. And that’s all you really need to know. If you can’t be bothered to show up, why should anybody show up? It’s just the end of the fucking world.” (Men’s Journal)"
How do you deal with wanting to leave your current job but not receiving an offers yet to quit and start a new job?,"Hi everyone, just looking for advice on the emotional/mental aspect. I really want out of my job, but so far I've only had a couple interviews with no callbacks yet so I have to grin and bear it until something else bites. I know I need to stay on the horse and keep applying and interviewing, but how do I deal with the misery I feel in my current job? I have no interest in the industry nor do I have any interest in the product we sell. I am the project lead for an aspect of the service that requires giving feedback and suggestions, and I am just not interested in participating in the conversation because I really don't care about enhancing the product or making it better or its future in any way. How best can I deal with this without having a negative appearance/energy? "
What do you do in your down time?,"Aside from scrolling through Reddit, I find it's super difficult to keep busy at work. I really try to stay busy but there's only so much I can do. I'm new to this job (it's a role in business) and I'm in a bit of a ""training"" phase. The person I am to replace isn't leaving for another 1-4 months and my boss admitted he barely has anything for me to do. 

What are some things you like to do when/if you have free time at work to better your skills?"
Why do companies feel that hiring people is more than just asking for their help?,"A person being hired is asked to help with the company workload and I know why that is so but beyond that I am not sure at all. I mean the first reason why people are there is because of the need for manpower like if I need someone to build car for me but I cannot do it alone I will search for people and as long as the people I find is willing to help do it I will have no complain with anything else they want to do but that is not the case with companies. But instead on top of helping them with what they want, they also demand so many other things of their workers and there are so many demands and I do not feel that all of them are absolutely necessary or primary. If I get a person to help me build a car I am paying them to build a car for me is that not it otherwise without paying them they could just decide freely if they want to help or not like how friend and family sometimes feel that they are not able to assist you at times.

What to do about racism at work?,"I’m currently very low level management at a thrift store. I’m struggling with managing some of the employees making unwelcoming/vaguely racist comments when South Americans and Central Americans come to the store. I’m unsure of what to do with the situation. Not only do I find their comments incredibly offensive, but if someone else were to hear them (they’re not very quiet) it would be easy to get into a lot of trouble publicly. I’m half the age of these women, so if I ask them to do something, they don’t really listen. But, I think this is something worth talking about with them. I’ve seen two occurrences of this happening, and both times I’ve been so shocked, that I didn’t do anything. I walked away and didn’t participate in the conversation. I’ve spoken to another coworker about this, and I think my first choice of action will be to simply tell them I don’t talk about people in that manner, and they need to be careful of how they speak about people on the sales floor. My second choice of action if I see it happening again will be to tell the store manager about their behavior. 

Does this seem like a good line of action? "
Fired because of 'no call/no show'.,"I tried calling my manager in advance because I felt extremely ill that day. I even left her a message, but she never responded back. My question is: Would this affect me in the future when searching for a new job? I know I made a mistake and I deeply regret it, especially since it was my first job. "
Why do people call it offered a job?,When you are selected for work what exactly is your gain? Isn't it the company who gain as they can get people to help out? Like if you ask for help and people willingly assist you isn't it suppose to be you are happy and your gain and not the person helping you even if you pay them? 
What does it means to do ok or mediocre?,People with good performance can make requests and get more benefit like pay increase but for those who don't they won't get fired but they will just be status quo and of course bad performance will be fired. So I am thinking when they mean do ok what does it cover and not cover? When a task is given we are literally fighting a war and losing this war means real life damage unlike school where only the simulation is damage and teacher can give and take freely. So if I consider this aspect aren't everyone suppose to win the war rain or shine and losing is not an option? If yes then what is a person who do ok but not good? Do they win or lose?
"Suspended on Friday, probably will be terminated today and I can't even take one step","*Edited to add:* I am in California, just to give some context.


The past three days have been nothing short of a surreal nightmare, so I will try to keep this concise and coherent.  


I have worked for my company for 7 years and in my position as a manager for 3. The company and my location are very large with many employees and my role is part of HR. I am the only person who does my job at my location and I report to a Director (and subsequently, her Director) who have never done my job before and really don't know much about it. Others in the company with my same role get to report to a Senior person in our position who is obviously very clear on the job demands and routine. Because of my unique reporting structure, I have always felt isolated, confused by the priorities and goals established by my boss, and frustrated because of the time I must spend trying to explain to them how my counterparts do things so that I can achieve alignment with them. I conduct a great deal of training in my position so it is important that I am doing this in the same manner as the other trainers in other cities.  


While I am very confident with the training aspect of my job, I have always struggled with the reporting/administrative projects I'm forced to take on as they are far more lengthy than what I have time for in a normal week. I am completely burned out, regularly working 70-80 hour weeks, and having taken no time off except for the occasional 1 day of PTO every few months for the past two years. I also go in to work (90 minute commute) or work from home at least one day every weekend. I have tried to address my workload with my boss MANY times, but was always dismissed and made to feel like I was just inadequate (by her, or by her Director, who isn't a bad person, but is often harsh and condescending) and the result was constantly being late in submitting these projects. I did receive prior warnings about my performance, and was placed on an Improvement Plan (PIP) in January, but around the same time was forced to take on the responsibilities of one of the HR Reps who had recently left as well as completely overhaul one of my main reporting procedures. Not surprisingly, I fell behind again and I was suspended on Friday afternoon and sent home (literally in tears in front of trainees I had worked with all week, which was awful) and told to return late this afternoon for the results of the ""investigation.""  


The Director has made it quite clear that the investigation will certainly result in my termination. I do not plan to fight this decision because while I believe that my failure was due to burnout and the constraints my leaders placed on me, I cannot deny the actual performance offenses for which I was written up. The Director is very combative, and always finds a way to squash any concern I try to discuss. She passively warned me never to seek out a conversation with her superior (our GM) without her knowledge and to just relay any messages for him through her. While I know a lot of this is not right, there is literally nothing I can contest that she won't find a way to dispel. That being said, I acknowledge time management is a challenge for me (I have had ADHD for as long as I can remember, and while I am treated for it, it was never disclosed at work as this is usually discouraged by ADHD professionals) and in my three years in this position, I endured my mom's terminal cancer and eventual passing away, my husband's unemployment, my husband leaving me, and then having to move all of our stuff 30 miles to a cheaper apartment with no help. My bosses are aware of most of this (no details), and I took VERY little time off for any of these rough times and even managed to stay connected with work if I was off. And while they showed a shred of sympathy once or twice, they sent a clear message that I needed to keep those personal issues out of the workplace.  


I still have the opportunity to submit a statement for this investigation, and while I feel like I owe this to myself (and my future replacement) to finally document everything that led me to fail in a job I was perfectly qualified for, I also want to just make this separation as quick and painless as possible so I can maintain my reputation and move on with my life. On one hand, I am absolutely devastated about losing a job I truly loved and horrified about losing my income (my finances are NOT in order for this by any means) as well as the crushing devastation of having to explain a firing in interviews. But the other hand, I keep feeling this rush of relief because for so long, my life has been marked by misery and exhaustion that I never fully recovered from because of my work demands... so maybe a drastic change is what will finally get things to improve (I keep trying to ignore the latter feelings because I NEED to be more worried about being fired and un-hirable. I cannot afford a ""mental break"" and its affect on my finances and future career.)  


I know I would forever regret not making a sincere effort to try and save my job at this point by writing this statement, but ultimately, if they want me gone, I just want to accept it with as much dignity as possible. There are some people in the company who believe in me, and I would love the possibility to return someday to work with them. So I don't know which direction to go with the statement, or even where to start.  

**TL:DR - After three years of work overload, exhaustion, and endless stress from my leaders which destroyed both my performance and my self-esteem, I was suspended on Friday and facing likely termination. Despite the challenges, I loved my job and want to separate peacefully and possibly work for the company again someday. Should I finally expose these issues to defend myself or just keep quiet and move on? What should I put on my statement for the ""investigation""?**"
How can I learn to be grateful? I'm always finding faults in each job I work at...,"So, I'd recently gotten a job in my desired field, which I am blessed to have. I guess this is just me 'nit-picking' and whatnot, but I do find myself somewhat dissatisfied if that makes sense. 

While I am grateful for the experience and lessons I can take along with me in growing as a budding professional, I find the entry position to be quite boring. I enjoy my coworkers but don't find myself to fancy my boss much. The field, however, is something I wholeheartedly enjoy and wish to further myself into. I know I'm in the right place, though I can't help but dread thinking about the start of the new week where I'll have to return and repeat all over again. I guess it's more of a dissatisfaction with both my employer and setting. 

Maintaining a strong work ethic is something I wholly pride myself for and am willing to work as long as possible before advancing to another position. Though I believe to have the ambition and discipline, I can't help but continue to focus solely on the negatives. Yeah, losing a portion of my 'freedom' is hard for almost anyone, but I mostly lament over those previously mentioned. 

How do you all get through it? I have goals and aspirations, but I know better than to rely solely on motivation. I can think of some positives; days off where I can spend time taking part in some of my favorite hobbies...earning money on a consistent basis, which will allow me to save up for a car, or a new mattress. Saving some of it and learning to invest, as I've wanted to do for quite some time...I guess that's a new start?"
Question for people who dont have any passion for employment: What degree and/or job did you end up getting ? and how much are you earning now ?,"Anyone else feel they have no real passion for any ""real job"" and feel they will either end up broke doing what they enjoy or hating what they do to makes ends meet ?"
My Boss criticized my work as Hacking,"I work in Production Support. Whenever we get issues/requests I always think of the best approach to resolving the issue/getting something done. Today my boss pulled the plug on me and said my approaches have been too hacky, which is a result of my comfort in the environment.

Although hearing this has a cool ring to it, I feel in professional setting this more of an ethical issue. Do you think I should take this as a warning?"
Are Indeed assessments actually worth anything?,"I have taken a TON of assessments on Indeed, and have scored really well on many of them. To me, they seem like valuable workplace skills, but I'm not sure if employers are actually taking these into account, or even care at all.

Do recruiters or hiring employers actually take these assessments into account when looking at Indeed resumes?

Edit: To add a little more detail, I have taken assessments both as part of job applications, as well as many assessments that I took initiative and completed on my own. I work in industrial electronics/automation/electrical/etc., and proficiency exams are common because technicians need to objectively prove they can do the job. But aside from exams relevant to my craft, I've gone out and taken exams for other industries. For example, I took the ""Marketing"" exam and scored ""Expert,"" so that gets me excited in thinking about how I can leverage that for a career shift/improvement."
Advanced Excel skills but not much else...what kind of jobs can I qualify for?,"Well I’m currently unemployed due to a COVID-19 lay-off.  However for the past 2.5 years I have been unemployed on and off as well as underemployed doing GIG work in between jobs.  Had a long term job from 2010-2018 and developed advanced Excel skills (VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, pivots, graphs, macros) but did not use any other in demand tools.  So I really don’t have any on the job experience using tools like SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Python, R, Salesforce, etc that would be required for data analytics and higher pay.  

I have been self teaching myself these through YouTube videos but am not competent in them yet.  

Not getting much response to my resume and have been applying to a lot of jobs.  When I have used recruiters like Robert Half and Randstad they only offer me entry level data entry type of stuff.  Me ego gets triggered by this since I believe my skill set in Excel is above the entry-level data entry phase. 

I am 35 years old and fear that I am forever going to be stuck doing administrative work at the junior level making 35-40k.  Was lucky to make 55k at my long term job and have never been able to find something similar since then.  The recruiters I mentioned above only offer me gigs that pay $15-16 per hour and that makes me want to shoot myself in the head.

There are entry level college graduates making more than me and makes me think what was the point of even doing white collar work when I am barely making anything at my age."
I feel unqualified for nearly everything,"I'm 29 and I have never had a job that didn't just take anybody. My first job was selling knives with CutCo. I can usually make myself distinct after getting the job. When I worked for Mathnasium I became the Floor Manager, when I worked as a substitute teacher I was well liked and was invited to numerous long-term assignments (where I learned teaching wasn't for me). 

I got a degree in Psychology, which you can't really do anything with without a Masters and I can't go back to school for another degree because it is just too expensive. I'm fairly wishy-washy anyway when it comes to what I want to do so I can't go back to school in good faith anyway. 

I mean, I'm fine spending a couple hundred for an online class but how do I know what business will accept? ""I don't have a degree in programming but I did take an online class on Coursera"" doesn't seem like it would fly.

I'm not secure enough I can do an unpaid internship. Sorry if this is turning into a rant. I just feel like I'm not on any path that leads to a career and financial security and that I'm quickly getting too old to start that path. Any advice on how to build up qualifications or entry level jobs that provide training on the job?"
Does working abroad look good on a resume?,"I moved to East Asia right after college. I finally secured a job in my field, but I do want to move back to the states. I probably won’t be able to unless I secure a job. Do you think having a job abroad helps with job prospects or gives it any kind advantage? I’m looking to move to NYC because I am in advertising. 

I would have one year of experience and 2 college internships. 

Probably won’t start searching for US jobs until after corona virus. I was just wondering! :)

Thanks!"
Is the PMP or Six Sigma right for me?,"I'm currently looking to change careers and have been thinking about up-skilling with a new certification and wanted some thoughts.  

I have a mixed professional background.  I was in the military, I have retail management experience, I have a BA in Mathematics and an MA in Economics, I was a Sales Manager for a large insurance company, and most recently have been a program manger for a large non-profit in my state.  Career-wise I have been utilized a lot as a fixer, someone that can come in to a bad situation and get things turned around quickly.

I have narrowed my search down to either pursuing a Six Sigma Black Belt or a PMP from PMI.  For anyone looking to know the difference, [here is an article pointing out them major differences.](https://www.villanovau.com/resources/six-sigma/difference-between-six-sigma-and-pmp-certification/#:~:text=A%20certified%20Six%20Sigma%20professional,project%20by%20a%20specific%20deadline) 

My question is, in the marketplace, does one have significant advantage over another?  I have a pretty broad range of industries and roles that I am looking at, but I enjoy the role of fixer/consultant, and want to prepare for director/c-suite positions in the future.  Both certifications look like they would be beneficial for me, so I was wondering if anyone had experience with either and how they are valued in the market."
Where to start in underwriting,"I’m a woman in my 30’s with a bachelors degree in agribusiness that I’ve never used, looking to change career paths (currently work in the veterinary industry) and have seen a lot of jobs posted for underwriting. From what I’ve gathered, this type of work would be right up my alley.
The problem is that all the job listings I have come across require previous underwriting experience—and there’s not really a certification program or class that gives you that equivalent experience.
So my question is, if anyone has any experience in this business, where did you start? And is it possible to jump in from a situation like mine?"
What sort of Writing Samples should I curate?,"So I've been applying for writing jobs and I'd say 3 out of 5 applications usually ask for a writing sample.  I graduated college with a BA in English back in 2016.  I've been working with a law firm but don't have anything I've worked on outside of College (and my writing has changed since leaving college).  

My plan is to fabricate a few different pieces that I can keep on the side while I work on getting guest spots on blogs, but what should I make portfolio wise? Magazine Ads for Products? HR memos for fake companies?    

I want to get into Content Writing, Copywriting, and Editorial type stuff but at this point I'd be fine with anything writing related and I know spec work isn't ideal but I feel like something is better then nothing."
Call center experience,Will working in a call center help me get a better job elsewhere? I really dislike calling people and scheduling appts or transferring them to speak with reps. I don’t want to stay in this job for long and end up old and useless. I’m in my 40s and not getting any younger.
Hiring someone with a disability?,"(If this isn’t the correct place to post this, can someone please direct me to the right place, Thank you.) 

I know this is kind of a weird question to post and I’m more then certain that many managers or owners of their own businesses would never admit to this, but I’m genuinely curious as to how some of you feel after hiring someone with a disability and seeing them perform their job duties very slowly. I ask this, because I’m a person who has a physical disability (mitochondrial myopathy) that limits my movement and I sometimes feel like I’m slowing everyone down. That saying of; “time is money” always runs through my mind whenever I feel or see my managers eyes watching me as I go about my job duties. I work in a small retail store and though, I know that this job isn’t particularly a right fit for someone who suffers from my illness, I needed something to generate revenue and I WAS NOT going to depend on SSI or the government at the age of 24 to take care of me because I truly believe I can at least do a simply entry level job. Anyway, as I was saying, I work very slowly at times due to fatigue and not being able to carry heavy loads and every time my manager and I talk, I feel like there’s some type of animosity because I truly believe he/she regrets hiring me but doesn’t want to fire me due to the fear of me suing for wrongful termination under the ADA law. Also I want to add that they knew I had a disability prior to them hiring me. My question lies in; As a manager (anyone in this sub) do you ever regret hiring someone who suffers from a disability because you feel their slowing down the work flow? Would you ever admit to, said employee, that you don’t think the job is a right fit for them because of their illness?"
Finding Entry-level science work,"Hi there, I have recently graduated college with a BA in what is basically communications. However, once I was too far in I had a change of heart with way degree. I minored in environmental science and took extra classes, but I feel like a fish out of water. I have been browsing through jobs trying to find entry-level work or internships in anything. I plan to go to grad school- the reason for this post is that I am trying to boost my application to give myself an edge with that. Anyways does anyone have ideas of job types that I can apply for, or maybe volunteer work that would help with my grad school application.... Thanks"
Resources to brush up on my SQL and Excel skills?,"The second round of my interview process includes a SQL and Excel assessment. I’m all right with Excel; it’s the SQL I have to refresh myself on. Any suggestions for free, effective, effective resources on sharpening my skills in preparation? Is there a preferred resource you like in particular?

Thanks"
"My friend had the experience for the job, but got passed up because he had the wrong bachelors degree? Is this common?","My friend works in tech and had a few years of IT experience.  He got rejected from a job that required an IT degree.  His degree isn’t IT, but the experience they were looking for matched the experience he had.

I mean I guess I can see why since it’s not the right degree, but I’d thought what you did in the previous job should circumvent that."
Helpdesk to Technical Support,"From my understanding Helpdesk doesn’t necessarily require a lot of technical knowledge and generally escalates the process. 

Technical Support seems to be broken down into different departments like Hardware, Software, Network, etc. They take escalated tickets from Helpdesk.

It seems like a degree may not be needed for Helpdesk, but for Technical Support it looks like either a degree or certifications or both are needed. If I want to pursue a Technical Support position, is a degree needed? Will certifications suffice?"
I don’t meet the job requirements,"So I have been just online applying to a whole bunch of companies. I finally got an interview for one and I went in yesterday. It went really well and a few hours later they offered me the job. I was ecstatic, as I need a source of income especially during this whole coronavirus pandemic. I gladly accepted and then decided to research a bit more about the company and found that they have a minimum age requirement that I don’t meet. I have no idea what to do. I surely don’t look very old but now I already accepted the offer. I’m only one year off from the age limit so does it really pose any problems? I researched everything else and in my state there isn’t anything prohibiting me from working as someone older would. I didn’t know where to post this but I really don’t know what to do."

Does QA testing require a degree now?,"I want to work in tech, but have no experience. I thought QA testing was one of those jobs that was considered entry level, but the more I pry into finding what I should write on a cover letter, I'm seeing more and more people talking about going to college for this job."
Does a decent personal blog count as experience to marketing hiring managers?,"Currently I’m a technical writer, but it’s boring and a bit of a dead end. 

I want a more creative job, so I’m thinking content writer for an ad firm or something like that. 

But my only qualification is an MFA, a niche literary/sports blog with 9,000 views per month, and one semester of web development courses at the local college.

Obviously the blog is my best quantifiable portfolio piece because of views, but do hiring managers even care about that? 

Also, what sort of creative/marketing jobs would a technical writer with a niche literary blog be qualified for? Like what are the job titles to look for? Sorry I’m a super noob to anything outside my current industry.

Thanks!

P.s. any other tips on what marketing hiring managers look for in a portfolio would be great. I’m aiming for upper-entry-level work."
Getting a job in HR with a strategic communications degree,"Okay this is for any HR people in here. So I currently work in marketing. I'm a recent graduate, and have a  degree in strategic communications. At my last internship I had such a  good experience with the HR department throughout my time there, and I  liked hearing about what they did. My sister also works in HR and has  great stories (and some not so great of course) but she gets to help a  lot of people. Would I need a degree specifc to HR to get a job as a  recruiter or the like, or could I swing it with a communications degree?"
"Why ""Attending Non-University Certificate or Diploma"" is a requirement?","If I understand this correctly, it means people who are taking or graduated from university with a Degree/Certificate is not allow?

There are few incidents when I being ask about my education, I replied BA in business economics and the employer never reply or reject my application. I know maybe I am overqualified or whatever, but I want the job and I meet all requirements except this, why not?

Can someone explain why companies want to hire people who is attending non-university certificate or diploma?"
"I want to be a Technical Writer, but I’m not sure where to start","I originally planned to go off to law school after I graduated from college, but I decided to take a different route. I worked at Apple for a few years while in college and I realized I really had a passion for technology. I enjoyed not only keeping up with the latest products and software updates but also being able to provide a break down of the products and features to individuals that were not as tech-savvy. I did some research and I came across technical writing. I know this is what I want to do. 

I noted Technical Writers not only have degrees showcasing they can communicate effectively, such as in English or Journalism, but they often have specializations in technical fields such as computer science, information technology, etc. Any Technical Writers that have a tech degree? Is a tech degree needed? Or Certification? Both?"
Looking for advice,"Hello Everybody,

I was wondering if anyone here works in transport in the UK?

I'm working as a transport supervisor for a transport company, and eventually i want to climb the ladder. I'm not in a hurry, but I would like to start preparing for it early  i guess. 

I know you need a CPC and an O Licence but i don't want to go through that just yet, so i was wondering if anyone knows where i can find some reading material related to this so i can go through it until i'm ready to do the CPC course? Like business and company law, financial management etc.

Also, is there a minimum number of years that i need to work in transport before being able to apply for a job as a manager?

Any help or advice will be very much appreciated :)"
Fastest Route to Special Agent?,"Hey Redditors, 

I've wanted to be a federal special agent for a while.
Luckily, my parents are finally gonna chip in and help pay for a portion of my undergrad. 

I have 2 years left, as I  finished my AA in High school. (M23)

Would it be fastest to finish the bachelors, get an MPA and then apply? Something like Postal Inspector or ATF Agent really appeals to me.

Or enlist into say, the Navy as a Master at Arms Navy Police? Problem I see there is that im stuck for 8 years vs commissioning in.  The experience would certainly get me noticed.

The main 3 careers I want over my lifetime is being a Special Agent, working in architectural historic preservation, and leading/running a housing or urban development state or federal agency.  (Really, just managing any mid size agency would be dream come true.)

In all honesty I would rather not work for 4 years at minimum wages to earn an investigators license mainly because I have a hatred for the private sector.


Also, would my undergrad need to be strictly CJ or could I double major?

Whatcha got? :)"
How do I bring unique qualities and traits to the position to stand out?,"I don't have any experience in tech, but that's where I want to work.

Is something like my personal outlook on life considered a unique quality or trait that would be beneficial to a position?

Let's say, I'm a very open minded person, so I enjoy reading many types of material and looking at both sides of stories. This type of thinking, I believe, is exceptionally beneficial for tech jobs like programming because programming is all about solving problems. The best way to solve a problem is by looking at it in as many ways as possible to see what could be the best way to solve it. Someone who lives in a bubble and doesn't explore many things in life wouldn't benefit from seeing a problem in many ways, as I would from the explorations that I experience. 

Or are unique qualities just the boring, I know Java and C++, and that makes me stand out. Or rather, I've built Pac-Man with c# in Unity kind of quality that would make me stand out?"

Is it okay to try applying to places even though I (20m) have no degree and still in college? Internship or some such?,"My parents have been pushing me ""to try doing more, instead of constantly doing jobs that don't have room for growth"" for a long time. I always told them its just a job while i'm in college and saying ""plus, its impossible to get a that type of job with no degree."" Until I did more research and found that its not true.

I have many things that I might want to pursue in life. My parents are Asian but support any choice I make. I just want to know if it would be wrong to have the audacity to bother businesses with applying. Here are some things I was thinking (Fluff):

*-Vlogging because I want to travel the world. They like this idea the most because they've seen how much travelling is my passion. (This doesn't count... you don't apply to do this)*

*-Photography firm/studio. I love scenery and photography. I don't know much about Photoshop but I have taken a class in high school. I also love exploring places people don't really go and taking photos.*

*- Journalism firm - Definitely up there with vlogging. I can meet people, I can travel, I can go to where interesting things are happening (I know international journalist is dangerous but that entices me more), and I have a significant part in changing the world. I'm also pretty gifted in English, Communications, and Persuasion compared to math. I also love learning new languages.*

Anyways... back to the topic. Would it be out of line?

Thank you for your time and reading."

"I'm 24, in a construction field, and realize now I know very little about construction (but I'd love to learn)","I work for a very small construction company. The point of taking the job was that the pay (at the time) wasn't bad, the work that was pitched to me was very interesting, and there are a multitude of jobs that I would be qualified for when I left. What I didn't figure into the equation when I was hired was that the workplace was toxic. Supervisors calling you stupid, insisting you're stealing from them any time there's a discrepancy in AP/AR, calling you at home at 9 PM to complain about how the office is running, and constantly telling you you're doing a bad job. This has had a genuine impact on my mental health.

As such, I decided to leave about 4 months into the position. I did not have much time to apply to jobs, due to having to be on call every day from sunrise to sunset (which is no excuse and now I regret not making more time). Now though, I have put my foot down and started applying with vigor. The issue I'm running into is that the work I am doing is not the traditional role for someone of my title. I have received a few inquiries with that same title, and I'm realizing that I don't know near as much as I should because of the way my company is run.

&#x200B;

After five years of hardwork I can successfully say I got a degree in finance with a focus in insurance principles.

During my college stint I couldn't really hold a job, because of the fatigue I've gotten with my disability.

It's been increasingly difficult to explain my lack of work experience in phone screenings, since I'd rather not disclose my disability currently due to discriminatory reasons. 

Would finding an internship be the right path to start off my career? Or should I keep on applying for entry level jobs.

 I would love to get a job at a university as a coordinator, and work my way towards a master's degree or even as a director, but it's a huge hurdle getting my foot in the door. Any recommendations would be helpful.

I want to be a college admission officer but don't have degrees in education or mass communication,"I have wanted to be many things, but one thing that has persisted in my heart is to be a college admission officer because having struggled with college admission due to little resources and financial difficulty myself, I want to be part of team that helps selecting well-deserved students to get opportunities they deserve. 

The thing is, I have a B.S. in chemical engineering and now working on Food Science master's with thesis. Y'all might think I am crazy or weird, but honestly at this point I am not sure what I want to do with my degrees lol...much less if I will get jobs with them at all because unlike my friends who have some Co-OP or internship experience, I have none(yeah being an international student sucks, but the good news is I will probably be a permanent resident soon!) 

Is it possible without education or communication major?"
Need advice getting back into computer science field,"I graduated from a computer science and technology program 4 years ago in college. I had an internship in app development but didn't feel like the field was right for me at the time. Since then I've been working in a few IT help desk jobs and customer service. I feel like I am ready to go back to work as a dev.

I know I have to work on putting together an up to date portfolio. However I am not sure if I should attempt to get an internship first or a  an entry level job considering the time gap since  the time I graduated. A part of me is also thinking of going to university but I'm struggling with if it's really worth it."
"Moving from construction to IT, advice?","I’m heavily considering moving to IT.

Hard finding entry-level jobs with current work history.,"Hi all, hoping to find some help and guidance in approaching new jobs. I’m 23, M, live in NYC. I have a BA in Communications (focus in Media Studies), as well as a minor in Critical and Professional Writing. While in college, I became a barista and found I was actually very skilled at it—I quickly moved up at a couple of roasteries and ended up landing a job that was paying well, however I left because it was toxic and absolutely draining. The issue with the specialty coffee industry is there are many low-level jobs and very, very few higher level jobs (anywhere from 3-10 depending on the company).

I’m starting to regret this decision because I passed up applying for internships during school and now every job in my field requires some form of experience (not to mention, I don’t really care much about communications anymore to begin with). I guess my dream job would be some sort of proofreading / copy editing, but those are also hard to come by for someone without experience, and internships are too risky at this stage in my life now (and mostly only open to students).

Does anyone have any tips for someone without actual experience trying to get into another field? I’m not even super picky about the field, I just want to find something that isn’t customer-service focused. Thanks in advance!"
New job but grossly underemployed,"I am lucky enough after 5 months of unemployment to have a new job. The only problem is I am extremely underemployed. My prior position did not have the title linked to it but my experience was that of a Senior Tax Consultant or Tax Manager. During my struggle with un employment and lack of title I decided to go after positions that would have had a similar title, not thinking about the gap in experience. At my prior position I was charged with client relations, account management, value negotiations, analysis, and billing. I unfortunatly had a crash course in my last job into every facet of tax consulting and management. My current position pays well and is at an extremely good company but is unfortunatly only an analyst position, my prior position at this company would be considered a Senior VP. I know I should likely deal with my position and deal with it but after 2 months it is obvious Im very underemployed. Im unsure about how to approach this. Its a great company and would love to keep working here but I fear I won't be able to deal with not being able to put any of my experience to use. I can already see ways to keep the cost of projects down and save 100s of hours of labor. What should I do, how do I tell my boss? I am currently working 9-8 as well and am on call until 9pm"
"When interviewing for an administrative assistant position in a law firm, how much do they expect me to know?","I have an interview for an administrative assistant position in a few days and it is a massive improvement from my current job working in a restaurant. I am extremely excited for this opportunity and I definitely don't want to blow it. I am really nervous though about living up to expectations. I definitely think I have the personality for this type of work and believe that I am qualified, and I know I can learn all of the skills necessary. However, I'm nervous about how much they expect me to know going in.


I understand the position involves taking notes, scheduling appointments, drafting letters and booking travel, but how much do they expect me to know on my own?


For example, when booking appointments will they expect me to know that they use google calendars? Or will there be some other calendar app that's standard? I've never purchased a plane ticket even for myself, will it be as simple as clicking purchase and forwarding an email to them with all of the info? I've never worked in a legal environment before, will I be expected to know basic legalese on my first day? Or is it acceptable for me to learn it on the job? Where do I go to learn these things?

"Experience in public speaking, research, writing - but not with an employer and not part of my education. How can I use those skills to get an interview?","**My education & background**

I graduated with a bachelor of arts in history in 2012. I wanted to become a historian but I only had a 3.0 GPA and couldn't afford to go to grad school. I made the mistake of working too many part-time jobs to get through school that I did not network or setup connections upon graduation. 

**My skills: public speaking and publishing**

I ended up working mostly in foodservice for five years. During that time I used my free time and my history skills and started becoming a published author, editor, and researcher in academic journals, popular magazines (I even had a column), and was credited in helping write almost a dozen books that are featured on the shelves of B&N and BAM.

The publishing led to speaking engagements and presentations. Genealogy groups, non-profits, churches, fundraisers, and various history (international) clubs invited and paid me to speak. Many were only a few dozen people, but a few were in front of hundreds of people.

**TL;DR: I want to turn my $36,000 office job into a $62,000 career using my skills**

1. Do you have any recommendations on how I can funnel those skill sets into an interview opportunity? They were really impressive in foodservice interviews but likely didn't help me.
2. Are there specific jobs/careers that would use those skill sets that are not typically thought of?
3. Am I being realistic? Are these actually valuable or a waste of space on a resume?"

How to properly negotiate job duties,"I'm originally from the U.S., the company that I work for sent me to work for them in another country for 2 years.

Up to this point everything was great. I was learning more and more everyday.

Recently management here has added more responsibilities, some of which are out of my sphere of influence or area of expertise.

How do I properly tell these folks hey this is too much or hey I need a lot more training on this before I can be held accountable for the results? How can I do this without sounding like a lazy bum?

This is a very fast paced job with a lot of responsibilities and tasks. My 12 hour days go by super fast because of all the things we have to do. There comes a point however, where there is just too much on my plate, I'm already coming in early and leaving late. I did 14.5 hours the other day and we only get paid for 12.

I'm locked in this position for two years. I cannot quit without having to repay the money they spent paying my rent, utilities and moving me out here.

Like I mentioned earlier, up to this point I was doing well, keeping up with the fast pace of the job and learning fast but these past few days have been demoralizing and I'm stuck in this hole because if I leave I have to pay back what they have already spent on me. 

Help appreciated.

"Is it possible to move up in a company with an Associate's degree, or should I go back to school?","Hi everyone, I just got my Associate's degree in General Studies and want to major/work in Graphic Design. Lately, I've wondered if I could receive higher pay and even move up in the company at some point if I started working at a company or firm with just an Associate's degree (or in any kind of job).

I'm thinking about this because I started a long-distance apprenticeship at a marketing firm and I'm also in search of a graphic design internship. I also found a company that can get me some experience (the same one that helped me find the apprenticeship) and connects me to companies to find a job afterward and it sounds like a good idea, the possible pay sounds decent and it would really be beneficial (at the same time, I'm not sure if not having a Bachelor's degree would affect that).

I'm thinking that I can get the essential hands-on experience in the field that I want to work in and that could possibly be enough, but at the same time, I'm not sure. What do you all think? Should I transfer to a college to study the major, or see about working in my desired field right now? What do you all think?"
My ex-manager keeps trying to make me change fields,"So I have completed a marketing internship at a world-famous multinational 6 months ago. However, despite succeeding at every task I've been given during these 6 months and having a good performance review, my ex-manager told me I should leave marketing because I'm not fit for it and should pursue a career in communications instead. At the time, I was too stunned to ask her what she meant by ""not fit"". Considering I got praise from other Senior Managers and did everything right, I decided not to listen to her and listen to my gut instead which told me marketing is for me.

Now, 6 months later, I asked her a recommandation letter to get into a MBA program and while she accepted to provide me with one, she still wrote in it that she hopes ""I will find a new path with this MBA"".

I really wonder: is she genuine or is she trying to sabotage my career? Also, this manager never cared about me, never asked personal questions and knew virtually nothing about me yet she's suddenly very invested in my career. Besides, she has always favored people with engineering background, playing favorite with them (I don't have an engineering background).

Do you think I'm in the wrong and I should listen to her or is she being malicious?"

If it means anything I can work a sailboat, I don't get seasick and I'm in pretty good physical condition. 

However this wouldn't be a long time thing for me. It wouldn't be my career for more than a year, I mean. Maybe this question is stupid."
An Entry Level Job with 5+ Years Experience,"I saw a legitimate job posting today for an entry level position that asked for 5+ years experience. 

It seems like there are so many **entry level** positions that require extensive experience. It was this way when I graduated college (I struggled despite having 2 years industry related part-time experience as a full-time student). Even with professional experience under my belt, it seems like all the entry level jobs that used to require 1-3 years experience now require 3-5 years experience.

After 5 years, shouldn’t you be going for mid-level positions? I just for the life of me cannot understand the expectation of entry level workers needing such extensive experience? I get the idea of working your way up the ladder, it just seems like there’s an expectation to get a mid-level talent in an entry-level position."

I've taken charge in workplaces before and have been a ""manager"" throughout my college courses by handling how the workload and duties would be doled out if that's more or less what a manager does im not exactly certain. In workplaces I've been the one to dole out responsibilities here and there and have taken charge there as well, but never as an official role that I could put down on a resume.

So my question is if i should entertain this job prospect (company wants to interview me soon) without having any official manager experience?

Normally I wouldn't even try to land a job like this but I am in desperate need of a job and am looking for whatever comes my way."
Qualifications Question: applying to PR job w/marketing experience,"This is my first time applying for a PR role and I have a few questions, chief among which is what typically counts as relevant experience.

The opening that I’m eyeing is with a municipal utility company. They’re looking for an in-house generalist (community, media, gov’t) with 10 years of experience.  My background is 10 years of marketing and community organizing/political campaigns. There is a lot of overlap between my previous duties and the duties listed in the opening, but I’m not sure how well it would be received as PR experience. I don’t know if the feud between marketing and PR is still a thing, but it definitely was when I was minoring in PR. 

If it is passable as relevant experience, how thoroughly should I address it in the cover letter? I’d like to use that space to go into my industry knowledge -- I have a masters in public policy focusing on energy regulation. Which would you recommend prioritizing?   
 

I’ve put together a portfolio of my writing, which is mostly policy briefings and articles for my undergraduate newspaper. The press releases and media pitches I’ve done are mostly for political causes and I’m weary of including them. Would it be odd to create some samples for evaluation purposes and use those instead?

Dearest Employers—a message from struggling college grads.,"Dear employers:
Unless you are hiring for a senior, executive, or maybe manager position... please stop requiring every job above minimum wage to already have 3-10 years experience in that exact field.

Only older generations are eligible for these jobs because of it (and because they got these jobs easier when these years-to-qualify factor wasn’t so common).

It’s so unfair to qualified (as in meets all other job requirements such as the college degree and skills required) millennials struggling on minimum wage straight out of college because you require years of experience for something college already prepared and qualified us for. 

And don’t call us whiners for calling it unfair when I know for a fact boomers got similar jobs to today straight out of college. Employers are not being fair to the last decade of college graduates by doing this. Most of these employers themselves got their job way back when such specific experience wasn’t a factor.

And to add onto this:
Employers that require any college degree for a job but only pay that job minimum wage are depressingly laughable. That is saying your want someone’s college skills but you don’t think they deserve to be able to pay off their student debt.

This is why millennials are struggling.
You people make it so most of us HAVE to struggle. Stop telling us we aren’t trying hard enough when your rules literally make it impossible for us to even get started.

We cannot use our degrees to work and earn more money if you won’t even let us get started.

THAT is why so many people are struggling and why so many of us are depressed. Being five years out of college, still working minimum wage, because a job won’t hire you because you don’t already have experience for the job you’re completely otherwise qualified for.

"Took a new job, moved for it, turns out I absolutely HATE it. Now feeling kind of lost.","I am a 30F scenic artist. Think of all the fantastical scenery at Disney and Universal parks - I do that. I grew up in a southern Midwest city with a handful of scenic shops and after college worked my way up to making 40k a year at one shop which was... not well managed. I love what I did there, but the place was a veritable shitshow. I honestly didn't think anywhere could be worse.

Around mid December I finally got fed up and started applying to new jobs. I accepted one as the lead painter at a shop in a much larger midwest city about 5 hours away from home. It was offering 65k a year. I thought this would be my big break into management, and then maybe I could leverage my way into art direction. I rented a place, my husband stayed behind in our hometown to get our house ready to sell and work with his company to get a transfer up here. He is a jeweler and doesn't make much himself, but he loves what he does and I don't want to make him miserable by asking that he find a job outside of his industry. 

I've been here just over a month and I LOATHE IT. The owner is a psychopath and the shop reeks of fear. Projects are horribly mismanaged and the art director is an idiot who contradicts himself every other day, despite having *written confirmation* of his previous decisions. I've never worked in such an uncomfortable environment before. I want to quit and move back home to my extended family and my husband and my cute little house, but I feel like I will be stuck in a low level position at one of the few shops there if I stay in the industry.

What I would love to do is start my own shop, but financially that's not really in the cards at the moment. How the hell do I leverage my skills (painting, fiberglass, bondo/bodywork, small powertools) into a better paying job so we can pay down some school debts, rebuild our savings (that I basically ruined by moving out here), and eventually get to a point where I can realize my dream of running my own shop?

My other, non-art related skills are experience with word/excel, a knack for googling and ability to troubleshoot most minor computer problems, experience with most Adobe suite products (in particular PS and Illustrator, with some knowledge of InDesign), and fairly strong written communication skills (lit minor in college)..

I'm not even looking for a job in my industry anymore. Just something that pays well that I can jump into without much training, that has half decent benefits, where I can hit my 40 and go home to try and plan out my future business. What should I be looking for?

Edit: I flaired this as qualifications as I'm mostly looking for what industry I can jump to with my current skills or with little training, but if someone thinks a different flair might fit better I'll change it to that."
"Phone Interview Monday. How can I make a case of my work experience, even though I was fired from my last job?","Hello Reddit,

I have a question regarding work experience as I’m currently job hunting. 

I’ve been fired from my last job as a assistant fashion designer as of December 2019. I’ve had this job since mid October so roughly 2 months.

I was also also working part time in evenings during this time but only as a seamstress.

As an assistant fashion designer, I did tech packs for the company that included fabric type, trim info, colour way, etc. We then send my tech pack to one of our suppliers in China with a sample. 

The sample and the actual product that I designed in the tech pack comes back and we make revisions. This means I have to update the measurement spec sheet. This goes along with doing a fitting where someone wears the product I’ve made and then we make adjustments and send it back to China where hopefully all the mistakes were corrected. 

So everything I’ve mentioned here is the basis of being an assistant fashion designer or technical designer in the fashion industry.

Since job hunting, a lot of companies are looking for a year experience or more in terms of technical design.

Since I only had a technical job for 2 months, and I’ve been fired, I was wondering where else could I put that experience in my resume?

The only experience that I have that are slightly similarly related to that was my seamstress jobs or my job as a student entrepreneur where I made my own clothing, or my time in college where I learned these things. 

I guess what I’m asking is, what is the best case I can make for myself that I do have some experience as a assistant fashion designer/technical designer without mentioning that my last job that I was fired?

How to move up at my job,"So, I'm a 23 yo licensed histotechnician and I'm not making what I should be paid. I was hired as an assistant and proceeded through the schooling to become a lab tech. The only raise i received after spending $10k to go through school and pass a I internationally accredited test was $1.50. Normally, a lab tech makes 25-$30 per hour but I'm still in the mid teens with my pay. This has happened to another coworker who still works with me. It seems like they're farming us for our work without giving us a damn bone. After all I would hire someone for tech work at assistant pay. 


Also, they're arent any other jobs in my field posted on my area, so leaving isnt much of an option."
How lax are public sector jobs about qualifications?,"I work in public sector administration at the state level. I'm applying to better paying jobs closer to home in the public sector, and I've found a few that look like a perfect fit for me, as in they're exactly what I do at my current job, but higher paying and closer to home. Double win!

Only problem is they ask for 3 years of experience, and I'm sitting a few months shy of 2 years. I know the conventional advice is to apply anyways, you might get the job, and the qualifications are really just for the 'ideal' candidate. 

But in the state agencies I've worked in, they won't even consider you without meeting the minimum qualifications. As in they put everyone in a spreadsheet and filter by the minimum qualifications, and pick from the pool that meets it. So this leads me to believe in similar public sector jobs (city, county and ISD level) they might have the same process. Can anyone speak to the hiring practices they've seen at the different levels of public jobs?

These jobs are in small towns, so I believe my odds are great if they give me a chance, but these applications are exhausting and I don't want to throw myself at the wall for nothing."
"Foreign high-school diploma but US degree, do I need to take the GED?","Foreign high-school diploma but US college degree, do I need to take the GED?

As the title says, I’m running into a bizarre conundrum. I’m looking to switch careers and I require a high-school diploma (trades apprenticeship/community college requirements). I did graduate high-school, but not in the US. And I hold a BS and an MS degree so I am obviously qualified to be considered. 

However, archaic eligibility requirements mean college transcripts are ok but high-school diplomas are more important. I do not have official copies, and the schools in my country would require I need to show up and make a request in person, which will take upwards of 30 days to get. As an alternative, can I just take the GED?

7 years in marketing with very little mentorship,"Hi /r/jobs, I'm currently unemployed and looking for a position in marketing.

So my question is: If this organization is only asking for knowledge of Microsoft Office, would that mean an avid Canva-designer like me (I definitely do not believe I'm as knowledgeable or experienced as a professional graphic designer of course) has a chance? Could I mention that I'm a quick learner and would be up to speed with their design software asap :,(?

Thanks in advance. :)"
"How normal is it to say ""I'm afraid you may not want this job as you are over-qualified"" ?","I had an interview in a close-by factory today. Thing is, I never had a real job due to mainly school (I didn't even had time for part-time jobs due to the sheer number of courses + travelling) and I could only do odd jobs which don't pay well. Most who applied here finished elementary and that's it (don't get me wrong I'm not degrading them). I learned at uni for 3 years after HS and the lady said to me that she is afraid I'm over-qualified. I kind of think she just kindly told me I'm not a good fit but then again we had a small test and I did best on all of them. Quick thinking, how can I endure monotonous work, colour-matching and how precise my hand was.

I wasn't rejected I'll get a phone call in a few hours if I was OK or not.

Now, I don't really want to spend my life in this factory but I need a starting point and in half a year this is the only place I got called in. Is it possible I'm really ""overqualified"" or could it be the lack of valid experience? I really don't know, maybe some of you can give me some insight.

EDIT: It seems you guys all imply in one way or another that they are concerned about me leaving due to the differences in qualifications and it's consequences. That idea completely flew over my head so thanks a lot for pointing it out! 

EDIT 2.0: I got the call, I only need the medical exam and all is set."
"""Pursuing a degree"" in advertised requirements",If I just graduated would I still be able to apply for jobs/internships that are looking for current students?
I'd prefer to leave by job and work elsewhere in Accounting since it's what I taught myself but I don't feel my knowledge is legit nor do I feel educationally qualified.,"So I'm reaching out today because I've decided to quit my job sometime in the future but I haven't the slightest idea how to quit or even how to begin looking elsewhere for work since I have, what I feel, is basically nothing to show potential employers. Like, I understand I do a lot and both my boss and my co-workers routinely tell me I'm ""not allowed to leave"" and if I do, ""the company won't last ten years."" It's always said with a solemn tone and tbh I'm a little tired if hearing it.

I'm 30 years old. I've been at this company nearly six years. I was hired through a temp agency. I have never had a different job nor have I ever had an interview. I have learned a lot through this company though. For the sake of easier reading, I'll try to bullet point this out.

- I spent the first two years working as a grunt in the production department. The boss and I got along about as well as oil and water and our screaming matches could often be heard over the deafening sounds of the machines. Nevertheless, I was kept because I often out-worked my co-workers. What took them three days to complete, took me only one. I'm not saying this to brag; it's what was told me as the sole reason for hiring me and what continues to be the reason as to why they keep me on.
- Due to the irreconcilable differences between the boss and I, HR (who doubles as my current boss) intervened and gave me a position in the office. Due to having zero prior job experience and zero education (other than a GED which I don't have a copy of), I was supposed to be their filing clerk. This company still uses an outdated paper filing system so I have six large rooms I must maintain to ensure every employee can find the paperwork they're looking for. I must also cull through the files at the end of each year because we only keep seven years worth.
- Two weeks after my transfer another employee unexpectedly quit. Her Accounts Payables duties were split between me and another co-worker. My new partner received all of the training from the departing co-worker because she already had prior experience. I didn't get any training whatsoever. Unfortunately I soon discovered my new partner felt this was entirely unfair and she should not be required to do these duties. It has been an astronomical learning curve but over these past four years I've taken away from her nearly every single aspect of Payables and single-handedly run this dept myself. The only thing I don't do is print the checks each month.
- 3 weeks ago my boss informed me that this same co-worker has been discovered to be slacking in her Receivables duties for the past three years. It is now my job to rectify our customer's accounts of their past due balances and open credits. No, I will not receive any training nor will my co-worker be punished. This is a moot point anyways because I have already resolved all of the accounts.
- Because a different co-worker is getting older in years, I have also been rather unceremoniously tossed into the position of being a back-up receptionist. I answer calls, transfer folks where they need to be, take messages, etc.
- In addition to these duties, I also do a lot of things which go unnoticed by my boss. I have a lot of freedom in my position tbh. I print labels, I type up paperwork, I maintain our first aid cabinets, I have the flexibility and training to help in multiple departments (inventory control, production, and shipping) due to me being tossed in those departments any time my ex-boss and I were fighting, I can receive in mail, I order products for various projects I need and charge them to my co-workers company's credit card, etc.

I guess my fear is that I may have my GED but I technically did not progress past the 9th grade so I don't feel well educationally qualified. I don't have the funds to go back to school. A lot of what I do know, I've taught myself but I don't even feel confident in this knowledge because this company is ridiculously outdated. (We still use electric typewriters on a daily basis except for my co-worker who still uses a real, old-fashioned typewriter.) This company is family-run and well respected in its field so I do have that going for me though.

If I looked for another job, would I even be considered for an Accounting position? How would I even explain to potential new employers the extent of what I do know without it sounding so far left-field (which is how I feel like it comes across)? I am currently paid nearly twice the current minimum wage. Could I get this again if I left and became employed elsewhere? Honestly I'd rather not stay in this wretched place any longer than need be but I never thought I'd want to leave so desperately. Until this past year, I have never really thought about it. Now that it is in my thoughts every day though, I'm completely at a loss on what to do, what to expect, or where to even start. And should I even leave? How would I present this to my boss who, I know, would be distraught? I'm sure they'll ask me what it'll take me to stay so how I can say it's just time for me to move on? (The motto of this company is, ""It'll drive you to drink,"" which is what I'm currently struggling with as well because my drinking has increased ten-fold. This has been incredibly detrimental to my mental health but I've been reluctant to leave because I need the money.) Am I even required to give them a reason on why I'm leaving? Finally, when I leave for a week or more, at least five co-workers must step in and cover for me so do I need to let my boss know more than two weeks in advance before I quit?

I've never had any prior experience with any of this so I'm rather at a loss in this matter."
Am I qualified for this position?,"Hello everyone, thank you for taking the time to help me out.

I am 23 years old, with a B.S. in Industrial Technology. The field I'm looking to get into right now is Project Management, but I don't think I have the required qualifications and don't know what my entry level options are.

For background, I spent three years as a package handler for a major shipping corporation while I was in school. My schedule prevented me from becoming a manager.

Prior to this, I spent four of my summers as a science camp tutor/counselor, and later as an instructor.

Currently, I'm with a national service program for a year doing disaster relief. A chunk of this work is related to project management, but I don't have much input as to what work I get to do.

This is a job I applied to. I don't feel I'm qualified, and worse enough, I don't know what the pay is:

These are the qualifications:

How do I make up for a lack of relevant work experience when applying to jobs?,"I'm finishing my Masters of Economics in the spring and I have no real relevant work experience to put down for financial analyst jobs that are asking for 1-3+ years of experience.

Aside from getting an internship, what can I do to 1) actually get an interview 2) stand a chance at landing a full-time job in May?

Any advice is very much appreciated.

Background: I was on the Pre-med track with a major in economics (pretty much a double major) which is why I never really had an internship in an office setting. I can code okayish in MatLab and I'm going to take a Python class after I finish my finals next week. I recently went to my school's career services department and they weren't much help at all."

I'm overqualified and I have questions regarding omitting my master's degree from my resume. How should I reframe my work experience?,"I am a licensed psychotherapist who is applying for a non-therapy job that only requires a bachelor's degree. I've decided to omit my social work license and master's degree from this resume. However, my past 3 years of work experience only involve doing psychotherapy.

I've managed to reframe my therapy jobs to properly suit the position I want. However, my two internships during grad school were purely psychotherapy, and it would border on dishonest to describe them as anything otherwise. Thus, I'm left with a dilemma:

1. Omit the internships and have a two-year gap on my resume. I could explain this away by saying that I was in grad school. They may ask, however, why then I didn't include my master's on my resume.

2. Include the internships. But then again, they may ask why I didn't include my master's on my resume and it might appear that I failed to graduate.

Both options would likely be perceived as hiding something and being overqualified for the job (which I am, but I desperately need it right now). Any suggestions on what I should do? Thank you.

**Update: After seeing the responses, I'll go ahead and put my master's back in. Thank you all.**"

Need advice; fully qualified but missing degree,"Hey all, currently in college for Graphic Design. When I started college, I went part time during the first year due to health issues. As a result, I was unable to take a design history course second semester. Second year rolls around, do great and finish it full time, but I was unable to take the history course for due to a course conflict. Third year same issue. Now I am in my final year and  semester, about to finish my last coop and, yet again, I can’t take the course due to a schedule conflict with another course.

Now mind you this design history course is mandatory, in only one slot, and can only be taken at a specific time once per year. Without it I cannot graduate. Other option was to find an equivalency at another college, had tons of options but none of them got approved. Didn’t meet my colleges criteria. My only option is to wait until 2021 to take it again after speaking to the program coordinator, academic advisor and program chair.

So in April I will have a fully completed portfolio from school, some experience outside of school under my belt, every course completed but one, fully qualified, but no degree. Will I be able to be hired as a full time employee, should I explain my situation? What are the best steps I can take to get hired? 

Much thanks!

Tl;dr: Completed every course for my Graphic Design degree except a single design history course. Can only take it next year, can’t graduate until then. Fully qualified otherwise, what steps should I take, and will I be hireable?"
Should I round up my GPA?,"I’m graduating with a gpa of 3.18. A lot of jobs say their minimum GPA for new hires is 3.2 .

Job title VS education VS work performed.,"Hi All,
I've been with this employer for around 10 years and may soon be in the market for a new job.
My problem is, despite not being a degree qualified accountant or CPA, my current employer has given me the title of 'Divisional Accountant'.
Should I change my title on applications to something more generic that reflects my (lack of) qualifications eg. Bookkeeper/Accounts Officer and just let the skills and duties (tax prep, reporting and analysis, reconciliations) indicate the kind of work I've been doing?
Thanks."
I'm having trouble figuring out what kind of jobs I am qualified for,"Hey all,

First time post on here. I'm currently in operations for a third party oilfield service company, and manage half of it. That being said, I'm 33 years old and never finished my degree. I'm working on it, but it's in English with a focus on writing. I'm about 20 credits shy. I have an AA. My current problem is that I have no idea what I'm actually qualified to do. I am miserable in my role, but have a good head on my shoulders and have managed up to 22 people at once. I am skilled with Office, and basic IT principles. I'm technically talented and test/service all of our equipment, as well as troubleshoot issues in real time. I set up our software and computers, as well as handle some logistical factors. I've even designed new builds for our equipment, and was responsible for QA/QC protocols that fixed most of our major problems.At the moment I've been looking for other jobs, but I can't exactly figure out what to look for. They say use your network, by my old network was customer service, with four years at that. My current network is all Oil and Gas, as I've been doing it for eight years. I just want to leave this industry and do something that isn't as all-consuming as this. I'm willing to take a massive pay cut to accomplish that. Any suggestions on what a person with this background could look in to would be seriously appreciated."
Am I able to work at a car dealership + what would the benefits be?,"Im a 16 year old who hopes to be able to buy a Jeep in the next year (my parents are willing to pay 25% of the cost). I was thinking of ways to make up the remaining $18000ish dollars as quickly as possible, I already have about $4000 invested in stock and I’ve gotten positive gains out of that. My mom said I should try working at a Jeep dealership to earn some more money and gain the benefit of getting a discount on a Jeep. Would a Jeep dealership hire a 16 year old and would I get a discount? If so, how much?"
"Should I spend nearly $5k to obtain certifications in an industry I am not yet in, but want to get into?","So with my job, I am in a unique position.  I have a few years experience in a regulatory entity, with over a year specific to financial services regulation and policymaking.  About a year ago, dismayed by my current salary and future salary potential at my employer, began looking for other jobs on the side.  My role is most akin to a compliance role in a financial services firm, and out of all the applications I have sent out over the year, I have gotten the furthest with bank compliance roles.  This would be great, as my salary would increase by 50-100%, I would receive better benefits (employer pays towards student debt and future tuition, etc) and the role would honestly probably be easier and more streamlined compared to what I do now.  I know for sure I can do the role and many of my skills and experience match up.  

Notice how I said ""have gotten the furthest with"" as I haven't been able to seal the deal as of yet.  I will provide three brief examples of this.  With my first opportunity, I got past the screening and made it to the interview, but was ultimately passed for another individual.  This was at a mid-sized credit union with a lot of exposure in my state.  My second opportunity I passed on, because the job would've required a move to another state and I was unsure if I wanted to make the move into compliance or instead explore other options.  I passed the screening and was invited for the interview, but ultimately passed on it.  This was at a well known investment bank, as well.

I am currently going through my third opportunity for a manager role at a regional community bank; I was initially surprised that they got back to me, as they scheduled a video screening the day after I submitted my application, and I don't have actual compliance experience.  The next day they asked for a remote video meeting with the head of the department, as the job is about 2 hours away.  The interview went well, but right off the bat the head explained they had a more compliance experienced person in mind, but wanted to learn more about my role because what I do is extremely similar.  That was yesterday, and while it went well, this position was a long shot in my mind and I am surprised I made it this far.  I even explained that I would be willing to obtain certifications ***before*** starting to assuage any anxieties over my exposure to the actual duties and responsibilities.

I am starting to realize that my resume and cover letter intrigue employers which gets me in the door, my experience in a familiar role gets me past the screening, but the fact that what I do is similar but not exactly what the role requires is made apparent during the interview.

At this point, making the move into this industry seems to be my best option, and I can actually provide insight into strategies and improve operations.  I am considering going full steam ahead into getting industry specific compliance certification(s) so there is concrete evidence that I would know what I am doing.  I would be more qualified and feel more comfortable applying for ""Senior Analyst"" or ""Manager"" roles. 

The issue is that, each certification can cost $1,500 - $2,965, which is a considerable amount of money to me out of pocket.  I can't apply traditional student loans for these industry certifications either, so I would either need a private education loan, max out credit cards, save up over the next few months, or get a loan from family.  

Given the fact that these employers are already taking me seriously with my current qualifications, is it advisable to pay out of pocket or take a small loan to cover the costs for an industry certification(s)?  At the moment I am looking at three options:

1. Obtain a more specific certification from a smaller professional association which would only count towards continuing education credits, not a designation ($1,500)
2. Obtain two certifications, both of which come from the most recognized professional association in the industry, and count towards the most well recognized designation ($4,790 for both)
3. Obtain only one of the aforementioned certifications from (2), which would still count towards the designation but not as much as both combined. ($2,095-$2,695 depending on which one) 

It's also important to note that, I could finish any 1 or 2 of these certifications within two weeks because I am already familiar with the subject matter, but less so implementation of strategy.  Further, I am holding off on pursuing a certification until I hear back from my current manager opportunity, because they could either provide them for free or give me the industry discount.  

Does anyone have experience obtaining industry specific certifications ***before*** entering said industry?"

Is it possible to get a job if unqualified by working for a low salary until you can prove your competence,"So, I'm a student at last year of high school in Sweden. It's not developing at all and a complete waste of time, I don't gain anything except making my family happy by a false sense of accomplishment. Now I want to do something productive instead, I want to start a company, but to secure funding and sustain a modern lifestyle, I need to have some kind of income as a full time job. I've great understanding of IT and computer related things. I have a basic (in terms of development) understanding of how a linux system works (partitioning, window managers, GNU utils, systemd) and the most common used tools used on the CLI, like cat, ls, grep, curl, git, vim, emacs, systemd, etc. So the most basic job I've found interesting that fits my qualifications is an IT-technician. Sysadmins and alike often require that you can do programming well, which is something I'm not yet qualified for. So now the problem arises that most require a formal education which I don't have. So is it possible to get a position you're not formally qualified for by working for 65-75% the salary of someone who has a formal education. It would be invaluable in terms of work experience, and I'll learn a lot in the mean time. Or is there other alternatives I don't know about which could be a better option, please let me know!"

Am I better than Customer Service?!,"I’m gonna be completely honest here. I grew up going to one of the best school districts in the country. I always got A’s and B’s. I took 12 AP classes. My mom is a healthcare attorney and my dad is a software engineer. I am incredibly privileged in numerous ways. I think that in part has led to some entitlement. In May, I graduated from Case Western Reserve University. I dual majored in Mathematics and Psychology, and dual minored in Sociology and Childhood Studies. In college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I majored in math to please my mom and everything else I did just because I enjoyed it. Looking back I would definitely major in business or actuarial sciences. 

Anyway, I graduated in May with a 3.3 GPA. For the 6 months prior, I applied relentlessly to every job under the sun. Human Resources, Data Analysis, everything! I love stats and data and working with people. But was declined by everyone. I ended up getting a job with a major insurance company as.... a customer service representative. 

I’ve had this job for 5 months now. I have excelled and am already bored. I don’t feel like I can relate to my coworkers. I make $16.50 an hour. I feel humbled but also frustrated. I love everyone here but this isn’t *ME!* I don’t feel challenged here, I don’t see the opportunity to grow. Most of my co-workers are living on minimum wage and I can’t even relate because I saved up $25,000 working throughout high school and college and being supported in many ways by my parents. 

I feel like an idiot writing this. I feel like everyone will hate me and think I sound like an entitled brat. Which I probably am. But has anyone been in a similar situation? How can I get past customer service? How can I get employers to take me seriously? I am taking 2 accounting classes at a community college, I am teaching myself SQL, and I’m studying for my first actuarial exam. 

Everyone around me is telling me I can do better than customer service. But it sure doesn’t feel like it. I’m embarrassed to tell people I work in CS, and I hate that I feel that way. I want a career where I can be challenged and start a family and everything. CS feels so stagnant. I would appreciate any advice."

Long story short, I am now in my mid-30's, decided to quit my job in one of the Big 4 tech companies after 12 years, and while I'm not yet at the point where I want to go back to an office job straight away, I'd love to hear your opinion and  experiences on the topic.

\- Dropped out of uni before the end of my BSC in computer science and industrial programming (yeah great move I know)

\- Jumped immediately into a Tech support / Customer service rep role for the next 3 years.

\- Spent the next 8 years in 2 different management positions (In B2B support), still in the Tech support/Customer service area, with job responsibilities heavy on Coaching/Leadership and Admin/Reporting, with months-long missions in Recruitment and Operations.

\- 5 Months in a UX/UI analyst role afterwards. I maintained a decent IT background throughout the management career (particularly on Network technologies, Mobile Device management and programming), which probably helped landing this job.

\- Native French speaker, pretty much native-level English fluency at this point too. I understand Italian/Spanish/Dutch fairly well, fluency in either of these 3 would be a matter of months practicing.

\- Interest in and good understanding of Finance/Stock market.

And this is where I am.

My worry at this point is that customer care/tech support careers seem to be a good path to ... another customer care job, which is and industry i'd preferably steer clear of. Most of my network left our company for another Customer care department, and I'm just not sure what roles this job prepared me for outside of it exactly. While leadership is an important skill in itself in my opinion, I am not too sure about the job market for a management position outside of my field of expertise. Also, the fact that I did not graduate can be an issue, as some companies/countries/roles will enforce strict degree requirements, while for others work experience can make up for it.

So in a nutshell my question is: What's your experience with your career after call center / call center management careers, or any thoughts/recommendations you would have based on my profile. 

Finally, I'm willing to relocate outside of Europe (the last 2 gigs were in Ireland/Netherlands), with a preference for HK/Singapore or if stars align for it find a location independent job.

TIA :)

Handicapped by work history.,"I work retail. It's an awful setting that doesn't actually give you anything in return. Unfortunately, that also means my resume seems to only be good for landing Sales and Retail work.

I have the aptitudes and desire for a technical job, like electrician, but my lack of applicable work experience or contacts keeps getting me passed over for consideration, and I can neither afford the time nor the money to go to school.

Not helped by the fact that apparently you need journeyman levels of experience to get hired as an apprentice nowadays.

Short of killing myself, what do I do?"
"I work as a stand up forklift driver, are there any better paying jobs this experience would help me get?","I've previously had retail/stocking jobs, this is in a warehouse with a stand up forklift, I'm on it for the entire day only getting off to put boxes on pallets. I get paid a little under $14 and this is probably the closest thing to a ""real"" job I've had, just wondering if there is anything I could segway this job into if I find this pretty easy/moderately enjoyable. I've tried the whole saving money and learning ""skills"" online thing, it does not work for me I don't wanna be a programmer. 

I think this still might be dead end since it's too disconnected from cranes/higher paid machinery, but thought it might be worth bouncing off of reddit if anyone has any suggestions, I'm definitely don't want to be management."
Information Technology Career Question,"Hello All, 

Just to give a bit of background on my education experience. I have a BBA in Management Information Systems, and I'm working on my MS in Cyber Security and Information Assurance. Also, I'm slated to take my CompTIA Security+ test next month. 

For my work experience, I've been working helpdesk for about two years doing Tier 1-Tier3 work. This is due to my IT group being a small entity so the responsibilities are many. While in college I worked as a Network Technician for 4.5 years, taking care of connections and installing infrastructure devices such as UPS's, AP's, and the occasional switch. Also, terminating connections and patching in new ones, very basic stuff. 

I'd eventually like to get into the cybersecurity realm, but I'd like to know a good place to start? There is absolutely no opportunity where I work for upward movement, everyone is riding out their careers, and there isn't any inkling of a new position being created. For example, it took the most recent admin 9 years to get off of the helpdesk. My management is standoffish about me asking anything in regards to career advancement. Can anyone give me some advice? Thank you in advance!!"
I'm being laid off around August but a friend has given me the chance at a great job that is in line with what I do now. The only problem is that I feel under qualified for one important aspect of the job. Should I be fully transparent when I send my email/resume?,"I want to keep this as short and to the point as I can but I also want to give as much information about my situation as I can so I apologize in advance if this post is long. I will put a TL;DR at the end just in case!

So, for the past 7 years I've been doing Data Entry and Medical Coding (ICD-10/CPT/etc) for a group of doctors. My mom is the head Medical Biller/boss with her own company so she offered me the job when I was fresh out of high school. I took the job for a lot of reasons (I could have money for college, I could help my mom out, no interview process, I could build up job experience, etc).

Cut to March of this year. Turns out the doctors are being forced to outsource their billing due to new changes/policies/laws so our entire office is being laid off. Two of my three coworkers had their last day on April 30th so it's just me, my mom and one other coworker left. My last coworker is probably leaving in July and I'm essentially expected to stay till August or September to help my mom tie up loose ends until the transition to the outsourcing company is complete. It's been a stressful process because it's forcing a lot of changes into everyone's lives (EX: my mom has been here for 24 years and she's being forced to close down her business in general as a result of this)

I vented to some of my friends about being laid off and one friend came back to me a few weeks later saying that a Medical Billing position just opened up at her workplace and they are desperate to find someone. I told her I can't start at a new place until August at the earliest. Yesterday she told me that she told her boss that I wouldn't be able to start for another few months but her boss is so desperate that she said that that is fine. My friend was also saying that all the people who have applied recently have had 0 experience so they really want me to send in my resume. Her boss essentially wants me to email my resume directly to her so it doesn't get lost in the stream of resumes on their job application site. This is all fine and dandy but I told my friend that I only know basic Medical Billing (from when my mom would ask me to help her with her workload) and that my main job was data entry and coding. She reassured me that they need someone to do coding in general for the job and that I could probably ask other billers who work for their company (in different offices) for help if I'm stuck.

She sent me the link to the actual job posting and the benefits, location, hours and the ""minimum requirements"" all seem to be in line with what I want/have/need. I'm just really hung up on the Medical Billing aspect of the job. I don't want to present myself as someone who knows what I'm doing in that area when I don't because I know it would just lead to a lot of problems and anxiety in the end. But at the same time, I also don't want to potentially lose out on a great opportunity just because I'm a ""little"" under qualified for the job (by their standards). I don't want to shoot myself in the foot before I even start by saying too much early on.

Should I just be fully transparent and give 100% full disclosure in my email to the boss? I'm not sure if there is an interview process after this but, if there is, should I wait till then to let the boss know?

**TL;DR:** I'm getting laid off around August/September from my job of 7 years. One of my friends is offering me a great job opportunity and her boss seems to really want me to apply but I'm worried that I'm under qualified for one important aspect of the job. Wondering if/when I should be open to the boss about that"
Data entry/Lockbox job at a bank: What's it like?,"I'm considering trying for a lockbox processor job in the offices of a major bank because I'm looking for something centered around data entry.  However, try as I might, I cannot get a good sense of what this job entails.  I know that it involves entering remittances from checks.  Aside from that, I can find no info on how much financial or mathematical acumen is needed, how taxing/stressful a job it is, and how busy daily.  I've asked on this board and others and even asked a former co-worker who worked in a bank's offices, but still can't get an idea.

Does anyone know anything about this type of job?"
Applying for jobs that require an Interim Secret or Top Secret Clearance,"Ugh, there's this tech job I totally qualify for except- I dont have a current security clearance. I googled and found it could take up to more than a year to get a Top Secret clearance. Is this something I could do for myself? Are these jobs only applicable to those who are already working these DoD jobs? Will the employer get the clearance for me?"
What do I do when I have way more experience than my very bossy boss?,"So, recently my wife and I moved to my hometown - in part to help out my family, and my parents offered us their house for peanuts (they're building a new one). I've been cleaning for myself for about 25 years. I have a job lined up starting next summer. In the meantime I've taken work cleaning with a guy I've known for years. He started a company a couple years ago. I'm a pretty quiet person, and I don't mind doing things a different way if my employer wants me to. But he.....well, doesn't have a clue what he's doing. He's got huge contracts with a bunch of employees. He's not mean at all, but just says things like 'no, no, no, do it this way'. I should add there is a bit of a language/cultural barrier too. And when I say he's doing things wrong, it's not just a different way - he's putting chemicals that take wax off the floor over time - things like that. If I bring it up, he just sort of interrupts and tells me his experience with it.

 This came to a bit of a head the other night when he asked me how much I'd charge to strip a certain floor. He proceeded to tell me 'no, you charge far too much - market value is half of that at the most'. No discussion, even when I said I've been doing this for a long time and never had trouble with work. 

In addition to all of this, he works like he's in a panic. And he's usually hovering right by me, watching everything I do while he works too. I'll be mopping a floor, and he will come up, tell me to go start the next section and take the mop  instead of letting me finish up. It's all incredibly frustrating for me. 

I can't help but wonder if this is all because I'm used to working on my own or if he's truly hard to work with. I know some other people avoid working with/for him because he drives them crazy. The guy would give you the shirt off his back, but he's just a bit too manic for me. And he has a bunch of jobs. Probably works about 12 or more hours a day, 7 days a week. 

Since I start another job next summer, I can't very well go out and get my own contracts. I'm seriously thinking about taking a full time job somewhere around town, even if it doesn't pay that well, just to get away from working for him. I should add I'm not exactly making much with him. Although I have a suspicion I get paid more than his other employees (some are from his home country, and he tries to give them work usually). Anyway, looking for any advice or thoughts on this stressful situation 

TL;DR - boss works like he's in a panic; has very little experience compared to me. He's a friend of the family, which complicates things. I'm finding him super stressful to work for"
My brother is good at chess and games. What job could suit his skills?,"I am very concerned about my brother's [22 M] future, as he is a talented young man, but young and stupid. When I was his age, I could have used advice to take me in the right direction, without wasting years of confused time. He has the same stupid notions as I had about ""scores not defining the future, degree isn't valuable, etc "". But, now I realize that it is never a bad idea to do well in college, especially if your passion and talent isn't in something unrelated to academics, like sports or art.

My brother isn't exceptionally passionate about any form of art. He loves music, but never showed an interest in pursuing it as a career. He is also generally introverted, but exudes personality in any setting, thinks beyond his years, but lacks the vigor and drive to make things happen. He also doesn't put too much effort into studies, until it's last minute. I think he can do really well if he does. What he lacks is a goal to work towards.

Now to his positives: He has always been exceptionally good at reaching jaw dropping levels in games, and he's been really good at chess. He is also physically fit, and has all the determination to push himself to the limits. I've thought that the navy or army would suit him. 

Does anybody have any kind of advice to offer in his regards? What could suit his skills the best, to which I encourage him to put his efforts to succeed?

TL;Dr: My brother is talented and sensible, but young and goalless. He's good at games, chess, and physical training from my observations, but hasn't done too well in academics. What he lacks is a goal to work towards that can set him in the right direction. Any advice? 

Thanks in advance."
I don’t know what jobs I qualify for or my worth.,"I’ve worked a variety of jobs, two that I would say are relevant for a resume. Neither of those are related to what I took in school outside of being good at some very basic math. I’m still in my first position post graduation (spent 6.5 years in school, been at this job for 2 years and am now 27). 

How do you even know what jobs you qualify for? I read postings and think “I could do that, but not this later part” or “I only have 2 years experience but I feel like I could do this job that requires 10” (being hyperbolic). 

I also have financial goals but have no idea of what I should be getting paid based on my current work. 

I feel like a lot of job descriptions lack specificity but as someone with a science + math background I really really hate this (give me clear, concise and objective statements)

Any advice/discussion is welcome."
Is my salary low balled?,"Prior to getting this job I had no experience with body shop estimating. My last job I was a porter at a dealership and I got tired of that. I asked my then manager to train me on the computers and do office work. I did that for a few months and found the job I have now. I knew some of the same programs that the current dealership uses. I have no certification or anything like that. My manager was willing to teach me how to do it and says he will sign me up for classes so I will be certified. My question is...my pay is $14.50/hr or about 29,000/yr. I am salary. Should I have asked for more? And what should I do about that. I know typically estimators make decent money but I thought since I wasn't certified, it would make sense not to pay as much. But is my current salary too low?"

Technology related jobs/internship for a 17 year old?,"To keep it short, I'm a senior in a prestigious high school that focuses on technology. Namely Cyber Security. Started with computers in the 4th grade.

I'm working at a retail job which I hate right now and would really like to think there are jobs out there related to what I've listed. I've also thought about getting an internship, but where do I find one?

but I also realize that most jobs like so are full time and require other things like certificates/higher education. even something like best buy which is barely related to technology sounds nice (although also retail)

Hiring Managers or employers answer me this: How often do you have a candidate that matches ALL the qualifications listed in the ad?,"I see all these job listings that I think I might be good for but I get discouraged if a see a qualification listed that I don’t have. Even if it says “preferred” and not “required” I still think that someone out there that has all these qualifications will apply and they will get picked over me so why bother. And I don’t apply. So I’m wondering, in your experience, how common is it to have a candidate that actually matches all requirements?"
How hard is it to learn basic Excel?,"I really want an on-campus job that lists, among other things, a basic knowledge of Excel as a required skill.

Warehouse Picking Strategies,"Morning r/jobs, I’m a full time student and recently got hired for a part time job at a warehouse.

On average,  there are 1100 cases per 8 hour shift. Training/probation period is around 2 months, and by then we are required to hit a 95% efficiency. This is my first job, so I was wondering if anyone has advice for this kind of job. Any strategies or “tricks”? I’m a big guy, hopefully got the strength, and I’ve helped move furniture quite a few times so that may help a bit hopefully. Overall excited but also a bit nervous! If anyone’s got some advice to share please do! Thanks!"

Does your degree really matter?,"I was always told growing up that whatever you have a degree in that it didn't matter as all degrees are really the same anyway.

Is online certifications useful for job application? Currently looking at GCP certification course.,"I'm new to the workforce and I'm very motivated to gain a better position step by step. I've tried the LinkedIn premium trial account and discovered some online courses that gives certificates. 

However, I'm wondering if they will actually be useful for job search aside from my own genuine curiosity for knowledge.

Is a history degree a possible way to enter the HR field?,"Hello all, just looking for some honest advice! 

Currently I am pursuing a History and Social Science education degree and was planning to become a teacher until very recently when I was offered a HR type internship at a small corporation during the summer. I honestly don’t know a lot about the job itself but I am willing to learn as I go. 

My question is, do you think it’s realistic for someone like me to be able to enter the HR field with the degree I am currently working towards? I have taken economics, statistics and sociology and done good in those classes. Just bringing it up because I’ve heard that they are related. 

Thank you!"
So I went to college for for a long time... and have a weird resume now,"So... I spent from 2006 to 2018 getting my first bachelors degree. I haven’t worked since 2010. What do I say in response to this in an interview? I want to say I focused on my family or some similar bullshit. 

Reality of my life since I know some people will gawk: I did 6 years in a frat at my first college, failed my thesis class, went home because out of state tuition was expensive, wanted to run for student government but my fraternity wasn’t at this campus, so I had found my frat at the new college to get into society so I could get elected. I finished my previous degree, got 4 years into a physics degree until I realized I couldn’t bullshit my way through differential equations and quantum physics. So I kind of graduated with just the first major after failing some upper division math courses 3 times."

I know once I have my degree, the door to more interesting jobs will open. I also know that internships will become more readily available to me the further into my degree plan I get. But my question to you guys is, looking at my job history, what kind of above-minimum-wage/interesting/challenging work field could I get myself into? Something tech-related ideally, and closer to part-time so I'm able to focus on my education.

I can say for sure I have strong skills and experience when it comes to customer service, multi-tasking, problem solving, self-starting, leadership, and even sales. I am highly experienced as a barista, and I know I could get back into that, but I'm honestly just lost as to what else I could try to branch into (that ISN'T retail) while going to school."

Apple college student Support strictly for college students only?,I'm trying to apply for a job and I really would like to get a job doing apple support because it's a work from home position and isn't physical because I really need a job that is more of sitting down (I'm trying to get into UI design) but I've seen the Apple call support position but it looks like it's for college students only?

Lack of a degree,"Recently I had the opportunity of interviewing at a company for a position. The screening phase with the recruiter had went well. Only questions they had for me was testing my ability to do the job. In addition, they were just curious if this job was in line with my career path. After our call, they said there would be an official application being emailed to me. They needed me to fill this out if I wanted to move forward in the process. The job requires a bachelors degree but I don't have one. I can do the job but again, I don't have a degree. I didn't claim the degree on my resume neither did I indicate that I graduated on the application. Even after doing this I was offered to move forward in the interview process. The other day I had another interview with someone there. They inquired about the degree being left off of my resume. I think they believe I graduated because I told them the name but didn't clarify it being incomplete. I have another interview with them soon and I'm not sure how to proceed. Should I use the next interview as an opportunity to clarify this?"

Accounting at John Deere," So, I received a recruiting email today from a contactor for John Deere about an accountant position. I don't really have a lot of accounting experience, so I'm not really sure why they're interested in me. I just got done with college and have never had an accounting position and it was not one of my majors.

Regardless, is there anyone who has worked for Deere as an accountant, or might have insight into what a job with them might be like? I don't honestly know a whole lot about accounting except what I learned in my one accounting class for my business degree.

I have a call tomorrow with the recruiter and I am not entirely sure what to expect or what I should say.

High School Diploma Qualifications,"Hi everyone, first time posting on this subreddit. This is probably a dumb question but doesn't hurt to ask. I currently work a retail job and I've tried to look for a better job in the past but most jobs require a bachelor's degree and up. I've been told by several people I know that I could probably get a non-retail job with just my high school/little bit of community college education. Have any of you ever landed a job where you were hired with just your diploma and moved up?"
"Generally, how much weight do preferred qualifications hold?","I applied to this one position and the description and requirements never really specify a certain amount of experience. Everything seems pretty basic and entry level. Then the preferred qualifications take the posting on a drastic turn and list 8+ years of experience in the industry the company specializes in, which is different from the field the position itself falls under. Would this position still be considered entry level?"

How to break into AML?,"Hi all,

I just graduated in May with a Bachelors in Criminal Justice and I am currently a Paralegal at a small firm. I am really interested in breaking into the AML (Anti-Money Laundering) field. I have about a year of law firm experience and another year in accounting for a start up company. 

My question is how to I make the transition? I was reading about the CAMS (Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist). I think that this would help set me apart from the pack. The downside to this is that it’s about $2k to get the certification. Is it worth it? Are there better/cheaper resources to break into this field?

Potential employer wants college transcripts. My college GPA kinda sucked. What do I do?,"Hi, all. I applied for a job and listed that I had a 3.2/4.0 GPA. It's not a lie, but it is my GPA calculated from only my major courses. My cumulative GPA is somewhere around a 2.8 due to my 1st few semesters being a bit rowdy. Now an employer is asking for my transcripts. What should I do?   


My guess is that I should send the transcripts with a detailed explanation of what exactly they're looking at and/or why certain grades were so low. Should I even bother? Any and all advice is accepted. thanks in advance!"
Can you tell me what it's like to work as a receptionist?,"Like the title says, I'm curious as to what the typical workday looks like for a receptionist. I've been an office assistant where answering phones was a part of the job, but never in a position where it was the focus.

How long should one be in a professional field before teaching as a professor?,"I received my Master of Social Work in May 2018, and I've been very eager to teach Intro to Psychology as an adjunct professor at any one of the local universities or community colleges here. While reviewing some sample cover letters, I noticed that they all contain ""I've been a Master/PhD of ______ for *X* years.""

Since I only have just over a year in, am I too ""green"" to be teaching an introductory course? If so, how long should I wait? If not, how do I keep from saying in my cover letter that I've only been doing this just over a year?

Thank you in advance.

*Edit:* If it helps, I also have a bachelor's in psychology."
How beneficial is it to get the Microsoft Specialist Certifcations?,I recently took the MOS word certication offered at my school and I was wondering how beneficial it would be for getting a job.

"What Does ""IT Operations & Help Desk"" Mean?","I tried looking it up on google but couldn't find a concise definition or any explanation of when it's OK to put this on your resume.

I volunteered but worked a lot in a position called ""IT Coordinator"" with a non-profit political organization. As part of that I entered data, beta-tested, and gave technical support.

I definitely did ""IT Operations."" ""Technical support"" sounds like ""help desk"" but I don't know if these are equivalent or not since ""help desk"" may have a specific meaning I am unfamiliar with.

Currently on my Indeed profile I just put myself down as ""Volunteer/Member"" for the job title for this organization and listed my various (changing) roles that I played in it. When I applied for a certain position it said I should have the job category ""IT Operations & Help Desk"". Would it be OK if I separated the different roles in this position into separate items and label the ""IT Coordinator"" position as ""IT Operations & Help Desk"", maybe with a description saying the formal title was ""IT Coordinator""? Or is there something about the definition of ""IT Operations & Help Desk"" that I am unaware of which would disqualify me from claiming to have held such a position? In which case is there anything I can do applying through Indeed so that even though I don't have that particular experience listed I can get them to notice that I have similar experience?"
Irrationally Angry About Intern’s Lack of Skill?,"So I’m feeling irrationally angry/disgusted about our company’s new intern and I need people to tell me to relax and move on with my life I guess.

Here is the situation if you’re bored and want to read about my problem(?): 

Our intern couldn’t even hole punch pages properly for document binder that was meant to go out to a client...It’s gross to me because my boss hired this person only because my boss knows the intern’s parents. We got a ton of resumes and portfolios from people with much more talent/attention to detail and educational experience. 

I know I’m being too harsh. I think I really resent people who get all their opportunities because of who their parents are but actually don’t deserve it at all. This is a total waste of my energy but I can’t let it go (wtheck should I be posting this on r/mentalhealth)?

The intern is brand new and only in their 2nd year of college, but people in our line of work have to be extremely detail oriented to avoid expensive mistakes. This type of sloppy work would not even be ok in school.

Why am I so annoyed at this? Am I projecting my own insecurities on this poor person or am I just exhausted by the entitled, useless people of this rich area I am forced to work in because it’s the only area I can find jobs in my profession? 

Thank you for reading my insanity. Please share any helpful thoughts - I think I’m losing it and being very petty, but am curious if other people have ever felt this way about something small at work. I should have used the time I took to write this to finish my work lol the irony 

Please ignore spelling/grammar I’ve never been very eloquent - I don’t even have an excuse. English is my only language.

Y’all have been leaving some helpful and encouraging comments - I really appreciate it, thank you!

Also - I hope I didn’t offend anyone following r/mentalhealth in any way. I was just genuinely concerned this might be considered ruminating or projecting or some other term I don’t quite understand yet because I am uneducated when it comes to the brain"
Applying to a position I'm not qualified for?,"Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Basically I've found a local company that is looking for someone that does, basically, graphic design. I've been looking to make a career move recently but have floundered in my current frustrations (and being swamped with current work).

&#x200B;

I'm an artist with a focus more in illustration than in web graphics, and I know Photoshop and basic Illustrator. This position doesn't list specific program knowledge, but they certainly use AfterEffects (which I have no knowledge of) and WordPress (also not knowledgeable). The best thing I feel I have going for me is that I really love what I have seen of their   company culture and feel like I'd be a good fit. I've also been an artist my entire life, professionally freelanced for a few years, and have a pretty good understanding of basic design principles (no degree, which they list as a requirement).

&#x200B;

But, I don't want to be one of those horror stories- the ""We hired someone a few months back who got the spot \*\*somehow\*\*, but she really is clueless"" - and put myself in an unstable position as a result. Alternatively, this could be a way into a career I finally feel passionate about (sorry, customer service, I don't think you're it anymore), and the company works a lot with local businesses, which I care about more than I thought I would.

&#x200B;

When my name was added to the national registry of people I have received a few offers for positions due to my new certification.  All of my peers at different agencies have been promoted Monday morning when they found out they passed.

Applying to jobs I am underqualified for (new grad),"Hello all!

I am a recent graduate with a b.s. in biology and am currently in the process of applying to jobs for my gap year. I've mostly been applying to entry-level research jobs (research associate, research assistant, etc.).

Losing hope in finding a job with a degree. How do you get a job with no experience?,"*sorry if this sounds like I'm venting. I just feel hopeless*

I'm almost completed my degree in B.Comm (Commerce) and I do have past experience in event planning and marketing (all through volunteering). Now I'm trying to find a job in my field (MIS, marketing, supply chain, and project coordination mainly) but I got nothing so far. I have applied to 60+ jobs and got only 1 interview. I also applied to internships last year and also this year but got nothing.

I got my resume and cover letter checked multiple times and I have been applying across Ontario but with no success. Now I'm looking at these jobs (even for entry level) and it makes me realize I have no skills or qualifications to make me remotely qualified for the job. All I really have to go off of is a degree with no relevant real skills. Apparently my volunteer work counts as nothing/is not valuable.

Now, I live in a small city with not a lot of jobs in my field so I was very open to relocating and applying everywhere across my province. However, I need to move out by early August **NO MATTER WHAT** (abusive family issues) and it's June already and I can't finalize a rental until I find a job. My city, since it's small, living off of minimum wage is feasible, however in the bigger city where all the jobs are for my field it will be a struggle because cost of living is very high there.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking about just giving up already because August is around the corner and I have no rental set for August. Thinking about just living off of minimum wage until god knows when because it doesn't look like I'm getting a job in my field any time soon. Feels like it's too late because rentals are going ASAP for august and I really need a place.

But all this has got me thinking, how do people even get their first job right out of university with no internship experience? I feel like it's almost impossible. I feel very trapped and that I will never get out of minimum wage. I feel like I have nothing to really go off of other than a degree.

"3rd Year College Student - No clubs, no internships","Hello everyone, 

I am looking for guidance as a third-year college student who has not joined a club nor had an internship to this day. 

Background \~ 

First-generation college student who started off as a CS major upon entering college, but couldn't follow through with it. I have always excelled in stem and participated in summer programs during high school (top 4%) at Stanford University where I took programming classes. I forced myself to pursue this major, failed again and again, was kicked out of my 4-year university but managed to get back in somehow, but now I am a Sociology major. I feel disappointed in myself and feel really lost in this new major, but alas, I'm trying to make the best out of my situation, I'm grateful for still being school. 

&#x200B;

However, I would love to start building my resume. So far it only consists of minimum wage jobs that I took up in college (Round Table Pizza, Pizza Hut, and Blaze Pizza), nothing related to sociology. So far, I have applied to 12 jobs/summer internships and have yet to hear back. Not sure what I should be doing right now to give myself a higher chance of finding a job out of college. 

&#x200B;

Major GPA: 2.8

Cumulative: 2.5

&#x200B;

Not really interested in pursuing graduate school right now because of the costs and my grades are poor.  Currently $13k in debt through student loans, which is not bad at all, but I would like to be better informed before I act out of panic.

Can I exaggerate on my resume?,"All these ""Entry"" level jobs I find are *not* entry level. I want my career to be in photography, but all the requirements seem to be asking for one year of Photoshop at minimum and a photography degree. I have four years of photography and Lightroom experience, and a bit in Photoshop; would it be okay if I applied anyway? Like, my photography experience is basically on par with a degree, and while I don't use Photoshop, I know the basics and can manipulate images so it isn't noticeable. For an *entry* level position, you aren't really gonna be the main photographer/editor anyway.

Same goes for things like customer service or marketing. All these entry level jobs are asking for one year of experience, would it be okay to just apply? Some of the other jobs I'm looking at is stuff like social media manager and they just want you to post on IG, YouTube, Facebook etc. I'm a millennial, that's easy, I post on social media all the time. But would that count as marketing experience? Like I know what they're asking for (Post a photo to Instagram and say ""Look at this product, buy it because of X Y and Z!"" or upload a YouTube video of a product). 

I guess I'm just frustrated that I keep seeing jobs I know I'm qualified for but don't have the resume to back it up. I legit saw a job that wanted someone to post to Instagram photos of products and they were asking for someone with a Bachelors in marketing..."

How do you deal with having a vastly lower skill level than your coworkers?,"Mods if this is not allowed, feel free to delete.

Bit of background about me: 
Did my undergrad in Industrial Engineering in a 3rd world country. I worked for a couple months in manufacturing then moved to data analysis and then business analyst (3 different jobs) in 3 years.
I then decided to pursue a Masters in business analytics and big in europe.

I am now doing an internship in a big ecommerce company as an Analyst (includes business and data).

They have offered me a job as soon as the internship ends but I've been seriously considering not taking it, mostly because I feel so underskilled compared to my peers.

I linkedin stalked them and they're ALL cum laudes with CS backgrounds and consultants from very prestigious consultancy firms. Tableau, oracle and everything certified. Even before the stalking I could tell these guys were in another level.

I was very sincere since the initial interviews about my background and skills. I barely know SQL (which I learned in one of my previous jobs), and I've been struggling with stuff they do so easily. It's making me think I might not meet their expectations in the long run. It doesn't help we're the same age or they're younger than me.

I've dealt with Impostor Syndrome before and managed to convince myself that they hired me for a reason. But this time I'm really doubting myself if I belong here.

I don't want to go back to my country as the situation is not great and I'll probably feel as a failure if I do. I'm not getting any other offers anywhere and I'm having all these doubts about staying in this company.

So I guess I want advice on what might be the right move here, just stick with it? Try to swallow all my doubts and endure? 
If anyone has been in the same situation how did you manage it?

Any advice is very welcome."

This is a specific job transition but I’m looking to transition into becoming a development/continuing education coordinator with a background in administrative assistant work. How do I stand out in a cover letter?,"Hi everyone, I’ve been working as a legal administrative assistant for nearly five years in my city. I’m frankly over doing this as I want to do something that has me more involved. I found a job posting for a professional development coordinator at a firm that I really want to work at. The ad doesn’t say that any experience is required but it says experience is preferred (doesn’t specify how many years experience either). PDCs are involved in continuing legal education programs for legal professionals like lawyers, students, and paralegals

How do I stand out with my cover letter AND resume with no experience? I KNOW I’d be good and actually content with this role. I have ideas about learning programs that I haven’t seen implemented at any firm AFAIK, and I’ve been around the firms in my area.

I’ve done permanent and temp roles, and I’ve learned a lot about each firm’s business and resources. I’ve worked at small, medium, and large law firms. I’m also constantly reading legal industry publications during downtime. Having been an assistant, I know where some lawyers might be lacking in their skills based on the questions they’ve asked my colleagues and I. And those skills are teachable and would make better use of their time (like less time wasting)

I just don’t know how to put all this on my cover letter and resume especially when the applications are to be sent through a software that filters out applications based on key words"

And I came to the realization that I definitely skipped a few steps in my career.

I work in politics. I worked a few internships and did a single campaign on the lowest level, and in college I flipped burgers and rolled burritos. But talking to the other new hires and my coworkers, and they have so many years of experience as field directors and campaign managers. I am starting a little later than the other new hires (they started last Wednesday), so the last few days of their training coincides with the first days of my training (we’re literally in the same trainings, advanced versions of what they covered last week).

"Got my JD, don't want to do law, and nobody will hire me. Hiring managers of reddit: is an MBA worth considering?","I got my JD last year. I hated law school. It literally broke my spirit, and by the time I got out, I was drinking too much and making far too many casual references to/jokes about suicide for my tastes. I was on a fast track to depression (like damn near every lawyer I've met), so I decided ""fuck this"" and bailed.

Since then, I've got a boring $30k job in sales. I've called it my ""work sabbatical,"" and oddly enough, it's been incredibly healing doing a low-man-on-the-totem-pole job with no responsibility. I feel like a human again. However, $30k is peanuts and I'm itching to make some real ""adult"" money.

The problem is that I can't get hired for ANY compliance/procurement/HR positions. I'm not pricing myself out (I put $40-50k), I meet the qualifications (*sometimes* not experience, but friggin' everything is 3-5 so who doesn't claim relevant education as experience every once in awhile?), and I don't have any weird crap on social media. Still, I have gotten nothing but crickets.

I want ""adult money."" I want benefits and salary, and to be able to tell people about what I do without them saying, ""really? _______? With a law degree?"" So...since every posting in my city seems to want it, I've been looking into online MBA programs. 

Hiring managers of r/jobs, should I think about doing an MBA to more easily shift into the corporate field? I just want to get hired to a mid-to-large company so I can get benefits, okay-to-decent pay, and a respectible job. Ideally, I'd love to be able to work from home one day. I don't care how, and I don't really care too much about what specific thing I'd be doing. I'm no Einstein, but I'm smarter than the average bear and can probably be a Flacco-esque ""not elite but servicable"" employee in about any role. 

Bare minimum, I just want to get in a position where climbing the ladder is possible, and where I can actually take myself seriously. Will an MBA help, or should I use my JD towards a field I've failed to look into? Any input is appreciated.

There are a lot of qualifications I know I don’t have, namely 3-5 years working experience for an entry level job. I have never worked in Finance.

Ok, so I’ve been tending bar for almost two years at a country club after ten years out of the workforce.  I’m 43, technically deaf but I have two cochlear implants now (that I didn’t have two years ago) and hear really well considering.  I love my workplace but I think they don’t realize my full potential because they know me more as the quiet deaf girl.  

Thing is, I owned my own graphic design business for five years and was really successful in my market.  Managed to get on the first page of google organic search results for my keywords.  I got burnt out with that and sold it after I met my husband.  We’re separated now.  In that ten years I had SSDI approved because of the deafness.  In that ten years I’ve also had a few other diagnosis and was pretty sick, had brain surgery, blah blah.  In any case, I was lucky the place hired me because I needed the work and I can handle the physical aspect for the most part.  They could only give me part time because the day bartender needs to be able to answer the phone.  I can do that now, with specialized equipment.  They’re willing to purchase it.  I don’t really want to work full time there because it’s really boring during the day, pay is tip share and fluctuates so much it’s hard to budget.

In January I reduced my hours for an opportunity to work at home again,  but it didn’t work out.  Boss ghosted me and I haven’t been paid for my work in April, so I’m back at bar with as many hours as they will give me.

Prior to my design business, I worked as an AlohaPOS software (table service and quick service restaurant software) support manager and project manager for five years.  I did pretty much everything including hardware repair, staging, training, installation, network wiring, remote and on site support.  I also trained on the same software for a large corporate rollout.  I set up a company wide oracle CRM which improved our customer service and response/resolution times.

I’ve been looking for Aloha jobs specifically on Indeed and LinkedIn.  Problem is it’s been ten years since I’ve worked with it.  I am also self taught with Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, illustrator, Bridge.  

I don’t have a degree, but have about 6 semesters of college credits.  Ideally I’d like a full time job but my resume is really specific.  I’m not sure the best way to go about wording it and I don’t want to sell myself as a general project manager when my projects were purely Aloha based.  

The rest of my experience is in the Restaurant industry as fine dining server, Bartender.  It was the first thing I turned back to when I needed work.  I was lucky they had a place for me considering I couldn’t hear a damn thing.  Now that I can, I’m more confident, etc.

I’ve tried working with Vocational rehab but have gotten no where with them.  I think they’re understaffed so my counselor is serving a very large deaf community in the coastal Virginia area.  

Should I have different resumes.  One for design, one for Aloha?  Should I try a recruiting service?  I’m open to office work as well.  Do I mention my cochlear implants up front?  With my hair down you can’t even see them, but I do need a landline to Bluetooth adapter to use the phone.  Feeling really frustrated and underutilized."
"Working in IT without university degree. Expectations, Pay and Self-Doubt.","I'm 28 years old, live in east Germany and work as a software developer since 2012.

Before I started working, I was studying Information Technology, but I aborted my university degree due to self-doubt, laziness, lack of knowledge and my former mindset of never asking for any help at all.

I only barely got my high school diploma too, because I was always stubborn and refused to do anything for school at all, but I was intelligent enough to kind of struggle my way through it anyway with minimal effort and, needless to say, with bad grades.

&#x200B;

Today, I’m living in a city with a fairly small IT sector at around 500k inhabitants.

My current company is fairly liberal when it comes to hierarchy and the need for any degrees. Our CEO always claims to pay people according to their actual performance, quality of work, etc.

That said, every employee in our company still only gets paid fairly poor, based on talk with colleagues and the manager for HR.

&#x200B;

After struggling through school and aborting University, and earning relatively little money compared to my friends (who all graduated, but in different jobs, not IT), I now feel like I’m falling behind. Some of those friends started working after graduating and they (of course) earn way more money, some even up to 1.000€ per month more than what I get paid.

Still, I don’t want to invest another 5 years of going back to university, earning next to no money and in the end maybe not even be intelligent enough to graduate this time. I lack skills even for basic high school maths, and It has been 10 years since I actually had to study.

&#x200B;

In addition, in the past 4 years our company grew and we hired a lot of new developers, and to be honest, I often don’t feel like the ones with a university degree are naturally better than I am.

From my personal experience with my new colleagues I can tell, that not the degree determines how good one is as a developer, but just work experience, ambition and having a knack for logic, abstraction etc.

I talked about this with my CEO, and he was very understanding of my situation. Still, he claims that a University degree won’t help me in the end, because I basically just invest 5 more years into an education that will give me only a better understanding of general mathematics, computer science and of course the diploma/masters degree, but won’t necessarily make me a better developer in the end.

&#x200B;

I’m torn, between my need for validation by earning a university degree, or by earning way more money, so I can get validation from my bank account, and the voice in the back of my head that tells me „The value of a human being is not determined by a degree or money. Don’t put so much stress on yourself, you earn enough money to live comfortable“.

&#x200B;

Can someone just tell me of their own experience, give me some advice or just an opinion?"
Will I receive unemployment if I get fired for telling my boss I won't do part of my job anymore?,"Little (ok a lot after reading through it) backstory: I accepted a position with a company in Ohio after I graduated college with a BS in Design Engineering Technology. I was led to believe that I would be working with customers to design CNC machines that fit their requirements. In actuality I was hired to be a travelling service mechanic. Every review for 3 years I told my boss I wanted an engineering job, and he always told me I needed to learn the how's and why's before I could design them. Meanwhile I realized that was all bullshit because my company hired fresh graduates to do those jobs anyways.  
  
Two years ago my boss was promoted and my new boss started cracking whips. Made my life a living hell and has me on the road 50-60% of the year while other techs get to stay home quite often, and most of it is no-notice. I started looking for new jobs but we're in a very rural location with little engineering jobs available. I applied on my company's website for an open detailer position, but HR said the company needs me more where I am. So I started branching out back to Michigan where I grew up and all my family lives. It's now been over 5 years with just one phone interview. I was just recently told by a family friend hiring manager that it would be tough finding me a job 5 years out of college with no engineering experience.  
  
So here I am seeing my only way to move up at my current company is to tell my boss I won't travel anymore starting January 1st. My question is if I give him this ultimatum and I'm fired for it, would I still be eligible for unemployment? My plan would be to move back to my parent's house in Michigan so I'd have a permanent address there. At this point getting fired would be a welcomed change to how much I hate my job."
"Hugely talented, stupidly loyal and ridiculously hard-working individual seeks next opportunity to have labour exploited for peanuts. Interested? Get in touch. Avail July 1.",This is obviously semi-satire.
"Currently unemployed due to COVID-19, but enjoying the pay while not having to work. Should I ride on my remaining benefits or start looking immediately?","Hey guys, so as the title states, I'm currently unemployed due to being laid off during the COVID-19 situation.

I was an IT Manager for about 4 years with years of IT experience in my background. I know in many places there have been hiring freezes and whatnot so I haven't personally began to look for new jobs knowing that right now they're seemingly non-existent.  I was laid off late March/early April and I've just enjoyed the stress-free time for the most part.

Right now on unemployment though I'm making a pretty penny while being able to take care of my daughter (we were paying about $210/week so not only am I able to be a father during these times but the money saved for not having her in daycare has amounted to a massive amount of savings -- not to mention that's one less point of exposure).

I know eventually my unemployment funds will run out, but as it currently stands that's going to be months away. I planned on using this time to get some IT certs while this all blows over but I also feel like if I stay without a job for too long it's going to be detrimental.

In your opinion, should I just start looking for work immediately or continue riding this out? I'm not going to lie, the amount of reduced stress as been amazing for my health, but I also feel like back in the older days where if I wait too long I'll have a gap in my employment that could hurt me more than anything (however, given the current circumstances in the world, I feel like I have a valid excuse for not immediately looking for work).

A few added details:

* I'm not hurting for money at the moment, got about a $12k nest egg with unemployment benefits coming in
* LinkedIn all updated with recommendations and references
* I definitely wouldn't mind investing in myself, going as far as to even starting my own little small business but for now thinking of IT certifications
* With unemployment I'm making about 20% less than what I was bringing in with my previous job but factoring in things like not having to pay daycare and a few loan deferments I'm actually breaking even until the funds run out.

EDIT: So I've already started putting in more applications, definitely. Thank you all for the advice, I'm going to try to be ahead of the mass influx of new hires."
99% Sure my first employer is giving me a bad refrence.," I've only have one ""real"" job with a company. I worked as a nanny before that and did some volunteering and work with my dad for his business. My first (previous) job lasted 5 months. I worked in a daycare and was cocerced into resignation for reporting child abuse (it's super common in this field). I've offically decided not to pursue a career in early childhood education and I want to take my previous company off because I think the director is giving me a bad refrence. 

How can I get a job if I take my only real job off? I'm 21. How can I make me resume good?"
Crossed the grim '250+ applications with no Job' mark today. Seeking exterior perspective.,"Hello all, I write this post for an exterior perspective. I have clouded my mind over the course of 1 year of applying for jobs. I can't seem to gather inspiration to apply anymore. 

I graduated in 2019 (Batchelors in ME), and I joined a Startup, but due to the depressive environment in the company ( very bad management ) I quit within a month of tourment. 

I believe I am a good engineer, I know my fundamentals and I am good with Analysis. I thought it would be relatively easy to get a job. And now, an year in, having given 6 interviews with 250+ applications, I find myself to be unemplyed. Of the 6 interviews, 1 rejected me and the others just did'nt work out due to multiple reasons including Covid19. 

In my most recent application which literally took 1 month, they lead me on with a project (which took me 1.5 weeks to complete), and loved the report I submitted. They thought it was ""great work"" and that I seem to be a good fit for their company. About a month ago, they suddenly stopped contacting me without any reason and don't respond to my emails or calls. It really hurt me because I had done 3 interviews with them and really looked forward to working there. 

Reluctantly, I find myself back to square one, sending out emails and applying through various sites. 

I still persue engineering with small projects, simulations and refresh my memory with the basics. It is a part of me, but it hurts not being able to apply my knowledge. I live with my parents, which makes things even worse, I want to be financially indipendent. 

There are companies I can work in (who would hire anyone instantly), with minial work on CAD and a low pay. I am hoping I don't have to resort to that. 

Ah, thanks for reading through. I could really use some inspiration or just an exterior perspective. Any advice would be appriciated :)"
"Issues getting an Interview. Any advice on how to get past the ""program"" that filters me out?","I have recently left my company after 2.5 years (yes during COVID.. I know). I had thought about leaving last September and browsed around but nothing hit. Well here I am jobless and not getting anything to hit. Can anybody give me advice?  


A little background on me. I graduated at the end of 2017 with a BS in EE. I didnt have a super great GPA or anything worth putting on my Resume (\~2.9). I got an interview through a friend I knew as it was his familys company. It went great and I got fantastic experience but now that I am searching I am not getting any hits.

Can anybody give me some insight of what I can do differently?  


I am also on LinkedIn connecting with Recruiters constantly. Thanks"
Should I take this job or wait?,I applied for a job at my local ups store the other day and got a fast response. They really want me to come interview ASAP. The employer offers $14/ hr full time with benefits. i was making $17/ hr at my last job. Unfortunately I have been out of work since March on unemployment and what’s even worse is that I make more money being unemployed then I do having a job. I have been getting $1750 every two weeks in unemployment which is $329/ week regular unemployment + pandemic relief (lasts until end of July) added onto that. If I take the job my income will drop to around $1100 every two weeks. I explained the situation to my family asking for advise and they told me to hold off on a job until the end of July. They believe that is the best thing for me to do. I’m not sure what I want to do or what the smartest thing to do should be.
Advice for finding temporary jobs?,"I am a college student. I don’t know if I’ll go back to school in the fall because of Covid-19, but my resume necessarily implies that I will be gone in two months because my college and my hometown are on different sides of the country. Does anyone have advice for finding jobs that would be willing to take on shorter term employees right now? I was supposed to have an internship this summer but it got cancelled and now I’ve been searching for a job for a month and can’t find anything."
"Very tempted to quit my job without a new job lined up, am I justified in my reasoning or is it all in my head?","I'm 23F content writer and I've been in this company for 10 months ish. At first, I really liked this job because my team in digital marketing was really great and fun and I got to learn a lot. But one problem is that our management (CEO, VPS etc) are super disorganized. Like has no clear vision of what they want, gives super vague instructions and indecisive on the output, gives us tasks without any working materials or assets and gets mad when the results aren't skyrocketing. The DM team itself is also fairly new (around a year).

Before, I could bear it cus I liked our team lead and the process but since the pandemic hit, they've pretty much wave after wave of lay offs because we weren't showing results/cost cutting (we work with international students so that's important to know).  I was spared because: 1. I was the only writer they had at the time for both operations and marketing, 2. the only one who didnt quit, 3. the only one who could work in a fast-paced environment. 

Right now though, I'm starting to really hate it here. Management is still super disorganized and has no direction, the new marketing head doesnt communicate anything and just tells me to do this and that so I have no idea what the direction of our marketing is supposed to go, work hours are spilling over to my free time, and the new 'senior writer and communications specialist' they hired is super rude and mean. Like he just barks orders and tells me to do the stuff he was assigned to do (like simply telling the devs or designers to make this web page etc). 

I was gonna suck it up until the end of the virus at least but something our new video editor said struck me. He said he wondered why they needed a new guy who doesnt know the brand of the company or know where to get the materials be the lead coordinator/project manager when the end result is that people turn to me to ask for those stuff anyway. And why they couldnt have just promoted me to senior and hired someone in my place. And like I dont wanna brag but I've been doing really good and have become familiar with all these things so I was thinking maybe he has a point.

So on top of feeling overworked, underpaid, and dissatisfied, I have to add underappreciated too haha. So I'm just tempted to quit now even without a new job lined up since my freelance clients rn can meet my salary anyway and I have enough emergency funds for like a year. Would it be a good idea to quit or am I just overwhelmed with stuff and the pandemic is making it worse?"
"I got laid off from my job April 1st, I accepted a new job that pays way less out of desperation, and lo and behold my unemployment gets approved 3 days after I start the new job, which pays double what I’ll make at the current job. What are my options?","I’m pretty annoyed.

I didn’t think unemployment was going to happen because it was taking so long and I was having trouble with the website (Florida). 

So I accepted a job at a warehouse who was doing a massive hire(some of their employees were working with covid-19, so half the employees are on leave of absence) which means the job may not even last more than a few months once their regular workers return. I completed my first week of the job yesterday and it’s truly a shitty environment, disorganized, low pay etc. I checked my bank account today and my unemployment benefit went in (more than double what I’ll get paid from this job I just accepted)

Is it possible I can quit and still receive the benefits? Or are you pretty much ineligible the second you accept a new job?

I’d much rather use the time to find a job I could be at long term while collecting the higher unemployment rate because working this job is going to exhaust my savings account as it isn’t enough to pay my bills.

How to get a job at a cafe (NYC)?,"I’m a college student currently off for summer. I’m back home in New York City and really want to get a part-time job at a cafe until college begins (which is who knows when). 

I’ve applied to at least FIFTY cafe/ barista/ server jobs this week on sites like LinkedIn, New York Coffee Jobs, and Indeed. I’ve emailed places that state they’re hiring on their websites. I’ve even custom-tailored my resume to not include my college background (in case of “over-qualifications”) and to only include relevant experience.

"Going on 12 months without a job, losing hope and looking for suggestions.","I’ll try not to make this a wall of text. 

I’ve been out of work for nearly a year and I’m freaking out. I’ve been fairly lucky in my life without having any degrees. Been in Management/Sr Management since finishing high school (21 years). 

My specialty is Transportation/Logistics (Oilfield and General LTL/TL). With some random but useful qualifications such as training of special waste (how to handle and dispose) and I’m an RSO (Radiation Safety Officer). I’ve spent a good time wearing multiple hats while my main objective was transportation, I’d also handle anything dealing with Oilfield Radiation Protection Plans and assisting clients in determining what their waste is (hazardous/non-hazardous) by sampling and viewing the waste characteristics. 

My last job was great, but working 14+ hours through the week (salary) and 4-6 hours on the weekends took its toll on me mentally and I ended up leaving. This was stupid of me, pay was amazing but my anxiety took control. 

I’ve have lost count of how many applications I’ve put in for logistics in the oilfield and outside. I’d love to get something outside of the oilfield because it’s so fragile due to oil pricing. I’ve applied all over the county for jobs as my family and I are willing to relocate and nothing. Couple phone interviews here and there. 

I’ve applied at gas stations, grocery stores, etc... and can’t catch a break here. Trying to get something in the door as my savings is gone and my credit cards are maxed out. I’ve always been the bread winner and this is devastating. 

Majority of jobs that I’m applying for are requiring a Bachelor’s degree in addition to experience. Don’t have one and definitely do not have the funds to go through school right now. What should I do here?

I was going to apply to walmart or amazon even though I know it will be a drag, I need a job asap.

Previously I was working in sales for years but I'm kind of burned out with sales.

These will of course be temporary jobs and my future will be a career once I complete college. Still I have lots of time and bills to pay until I get my cap and gown.

About to lose a job during quarantine. What should I do next?,"I started working at this company for only about 3 months now. Before that, I was collecting unemployment for about 3 months as well. I started working for this company as a new employee , and two days in the office the lock down was announced and I was forced to work from home. 

It was an absolute mess, there was no structure, and I tried the best to my abilities to learn to structure and interface of my company. (I am a data analyst). I then find out that my boss is very micromanaging and called me out in front of everybody in the team for not knowing specific material. Then after that, she called me everyday in the morning to nitpick at my work and pretty much told me how unhappy she is with my progress. She told me that I am learning at a slow pace and that she's ""having second thoughts"". 

Everybody in the company does not get along with her, and this quarantine is not making it any better. She's very hard to deal with and any small mistake that I make she screams at me on a one on one meeting. I have to meet with her every morning through zoom for about 1-2 hours and every time she leaves with a bad taste in her mouth. 

I try to reach out to help from my peers but a lot of them do not respond to assist me, which I totally understand because it's quarantine season and they need to get their work done. Pretty much nobody is training me, and I am left in the fire with no actual material to work with. I try to do things on my own, but it strays me off the wrong path. One of my co-workers today set up a meeting with me and told me that ""she will be teaching me for a week to see if my boss will re-consider"". 

It just shows that I am on fire and on extreme watch, and I do not think I have much time left. Worst case scenario, I get fired, will I still be able to collect unemployment? I cannot afford to get fired right now as I have to pay for rent. I really need your help as I am sitting here anxiously trying my best at my job but nothing seems to be working.

How do you break the cycle of bad jobs while you're still unemployed?,"One job is better than no job, and it’s easier to find a better job if you’re already working.

Got a job offer but thinking of declining because it pays less than unemployment,"After I was laid off in March, I immediately began looking for work. Once the recent stimulus bill rolled out, I applied for UI and took advantage of the extra $600 per week that was being doled out. 

I finally got a callback for an interview for a work from home position and got the job on the spot. The thing is, the job pays 75% of what I currently get in UI. Effectively, I’d make more money collecting unemployment than working 8 hours, 6 days a week with this latest job offer.

Was Just Terminated Due to Poor Performance (Illinois),"Hi all,

I saw this coming from pretty far away, and I did my best to prepare for it mentally, financially, and professionally. I am not surprised by the outcome, and I've more or less come to terms with the fact.

My workload was too high prior to COVID, and it just got worse with the pandemic, and I could no longer maintain a reasonable workflow. My employers ended up taking away 75% of my clients in the end, and I tried to utilize that time to ramp up my effort in a job search. We'll see if that paid off at all. 

The environment was toxic, and every day was filled with anxiety worrying about defusing the next problem. It had all gotten to my head, but everyone advised me to stick it out and not quit so I could at  least apply for unemployment. To those people, I thank you. 

That being said, I am now in the position where I need to apply for unemployment, and wanted to ask for any advice from people who know Illinois' unemployment system. I was fired due to poor performance, do I have to approach this application from a special angle, or do I need to state honestly that I was fired due to poor performance? Not sure if this is important information, but during the phone call my manager stated that I will received 2 weeks severance, and my prorated vacation days."
How big of an employment gap is acceptable?,"I left my job in January 2020 due to health issues of my family. Both my mom & dad fell sick at the same time which was feared to be Covid-19 but thankfully it wasn't. I've been looking for an opportunity ever since and it's nearly the end of May. I've had interviews in between but most companies either took down the position or froze hiring because of which I now have a substantial gap between January-May till I get a job. 

Can anyone tell me if companies would consider this gap due to the current pandemic or is my chance of restarting a career in high risk? 

Looking for opinions."

I got asked if I needed her to take back some of the work since I was doing more than my fair share but that just made things worse for me. I wasn't really fighting back in terms of sharing with our supervisor all the things this other person did wrong. It seemed petty at the time. But then I tried applying for unemployment because it's not fair I was essentially bullied into quitting and my supervisor told unemployment I quit over a ""personality difference"" and  they denied my claim. Because I didn't lose my job over covid I don't qualify for emergency aid either. 

I've tried getting funding to go back to school and gets some new skills training but I can't afford the tuition and I don't qualify for any student aid and because of covid the bank is being stricter with lines of credit so Im not able to receive funding through my bank either despite good credit. 

I am applying for minimum wage jobs now just to get something coming in but even those jobs aren't calling me back. 

Should I dumb down my resume or something? I'm at the end of my rope here."
Have not heard one word in over two months from one job since temp closing due to Covid. Is this a good reason to start job hunting?,"the last time I heard from my  manager was about a few days after the store closed, and basically was ""yeah we're closing, no idea what will happen. I'll keep you updated."" But the update never came, and now it's been over 2 months and still no word from her. No way to contact, nothing. Do you think my job is toast?"
I feel very stuck in my position,So I graduated with a bachelors degree in sports management and business administration. I am currently working in my MBA which I will finish in May 2021. I got a job as a claims adjuster and they aren’t onboard if people because of COVID-19 so I started working at Home Depot. I try to apply for other jobs but it’s hard to get a job with little experience and being fresh out of college. I want to get the ball rolling on my career so I want to keep applying for other jobs but that claims adjuster position looks great and it pays well. Should I just keep applying and praying? Maybe I’m just being impatient. Any help would be great.
"If I choose to not relocate for my job, and the company lets me go- can I still file for unemployment (CA)","I work with a consultation company that is contracted with other organizations. The location I work at is not renewing contract and there might be another location in CA in my local area for me to move, but if that’s not an option, they will likely ask me to relocate elsewhere, even out of state. If I decline relocation (but don’t quit) and they in turn lay me off because there is no other work opportunity, can they contest unemployment or am I even eligible for unemployment?

"I have nothing holding me down, where should I work?","I have a BA in psychology and I'm a 27 year old male. I live about an hour away from NYC.

Thankful for the chopping block?,"(Just giving general background first. **Asking for advice through the bold lettering in the post**. ANY words of wisdom would be very appreciated :) )

My boss pulled me into a meeting today to tell me that my numbers as a salesman aren't quite making the cut. Our company is currently losing money due to Covid and they need to cut some fat on under performers. I started my sales position in February. Definitely a less than optimal time to be calling on cold accounts, lol. When he gave me the news there were a lot of different emotions going through my head: embarrassment, sadness for lost relationships, but most of all relief. I've known since the week I started that cold selling wasn't for me. I love people and connecting with them and sharing similar interests, but the idea of calling someone's personal cell phone during a pandemic and asking them to make a huge and expensive commitment to our services caused intense anxiety every day.

Sales just wasn't for me, and that's okay. I'm 22 and this is my first career out of school. The original purpose of the job was to move to another state (mission accomplished!) and I'll always be thankful for the opportunity, professional development, and relationships that have been created along the way.

**My problem lies in finding a new position. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do/what I'm qualified for.**

I got my degree in Communication Studies because everyone told me I was good at talking to people and so my dumb 18 year old brain translated that into the wisest degree path. 120 credits on communication theory and a years worth of professional recruiting/sales experience later I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbs wondering what job I would possibly enjoy/be qualified for. I've heard the term ""you just have to see what jobs are out there"" a million times from friends and loved ones. I go looking and don't see anything that appeals to me. Something that my previous company emphasized was finding the ""why"" in what you do. I love the idea, but it's something that I've struggled finding the answer to for my entire life. I always fly by the seat of my pants and do things because they feel good in the moment. I have never sat down and said ""I want to be a \*insert occupation\* because I want to \*insert personal value\*."" Just isn't how my brain operates. I just don't want to end up in a position where I find another job I don't care about and repeat this process.

**I am a recent college graduate with a BA in Communication. I am very extroverted and huge on interpersonal relationship development. My work experience has persisted of Human Resources Training, Recruiting, Sales, and Entertainment jobs. I have no idea what I want to do or why I want to do the things I choose to. Seeking advice on finding purpose in work, job recommendations, or any thoughts that run through your head after reading this.**

If you have any additional questions about my background or intent I'm happy to answer. Thanks!"
"I've been told if I don't take this voluntary incentive program offered to everyone, I am likely to be laid off (short tenure and very high salary, staff level). Need advice.","I would receive a gross $20,815 over 8 weeks (plus 8 weeks of health benefits), and my PTO payout of approximately $6,500 (this would be paid out either) if I took the voluntary incentive program. Last day would be June 30th. I have attempted to negotiate but since the program is a flat offer for each person by seniority (0-3 years, 4-6 years etc.), they can't negotiate because it would leave them open to questions from those they didn't allow to negotiate (it's a law firm so I'm sure they have legal reasons for this).

If I did get laid off instead, the severence would instead be 3-4 weeks (one month medical) and I am not sure they'd negotiate this either. I have pretty good arguments having led a successful project that impacted each partners' bottom line this year (I am not exaggerating that I was integral and it was extremely important, and I came up with the solutions). They would want me to sign a severance agreement for the Voluntary Program. Unsure if I got laid off if they would want me to sign something or not.

4 weeks would be about $8,000 instead of the $20,815. Unemployment over the max 26 weeks would only pay $13,000-ish in my state and I'd have to deal with re-certifying and waiting.

Would having a layoff on my record be worse than having a resignation? I know the firm can't and won't really say anything either way, just that i was employed through July 1st.

Are there any other considerations I should make as far as how this might affect future salaries and savings ? I'm kind of annoyed that I have to make this decision at all.

I have $15,000 emergency fund and $375,000 in retirement. Age 37/F."

Get Unemployment Benefits From a Year Ago?,"I do not have American citizenship. I was employed (W2) in Illinois from 2012-2019 with the same company that also sponsored by a work visa. 

I started my green card process in April 2019 and received it in September 2019. 

I got laid off in June 2019 and did NOT have a green card at the time so I couldn't get unemployment benefits. 

From July 2019 to April 2020 I was an entrepreneur (no W2 nor 1099), living off of my savings, and I never ever received any wage/money (not even cash) at all ever since I got laid off. Today I'm running out of money and cannot continue working for free so I am looking for a full-time job. 

I am wondering if I can retro-actively benefit from unemployment insurance for as long as I can in the past? 

I tried to call the hotline at the Illinois Department Employment Security (IDES) but I could never get ahold of anyone. I'm genuinely trying to see what I can legally get from the government (if anything) considering my work history."
"I, a software engineer, was recently got laid off because of the pandemic. What can I learn to improve myself in the meantime and when should I start to apply again?","Hi all,

For the past 3 years, I was working as a software engineer for an aerospace company (not the big ones like Boeing, Raytheon, NG). At this company, they have their own coding language but it was very similar to Python and I'm sure not a lot of people outside of this company will recognize this language. Now that I'm looking for work again, should I stay in the aerospace industry and hope to apply my aviation knowledge or should I brush up my coding and apply for a role at a non-aviation company?

I'm sure I'm not the only one that is laid off during this time and I hope everyone is taking care of themselves.

Thank you for your time!"
moving for the summer with no job prospects,"hello! i'm a (20f) senior college student majoring in marketing/graphic design, with a small freelance photography job on the side. i live in an incredibly small town. i had an internship lined up for me in dc, but due to covid, it unfortunately fell through.

would moving for two months to a city with no steady income be a bad move? i know for a fact that it would help with my mental health and motivate me. i have enough money saved to sustain myself, and believe that i would be able to find some opportunities with the photography, as i did last year. i'm just worried that covid has totally taken a lot of my chances away. what would you suggest? at the moment, i've been searching for jobs through indeed and linkedin, and have found some apartments."

My situation. I'm a 90% service connected disabled, medically retired Veteran and I have been unemployed now for almost four years.

I have solid references, enough IT certifications to wallpaper a house, extensive experience and training. 

I've had my resume professionally reviewed, gotten on Indeed, LinkedIn, USAJOBs, the State unemployment office and applied for any position posting that was even tangentially related to my past work history and experience.  Thus far out of hundreds of applications I've had only 3 responses with 1 interview and that did not result in a callback.

Is it stupid to try to find a new job right now?,I have gainful employment. I know this is the worst time in my life to look for a new job...  but I have been abused by my boss for 12 years and today I hit my wall.  I’m a production control manager at a steel company in the US- western PA. Is it a complete waste of time to try to look for a new job right now?  Any comments would be appreciated.
Find job or wait it out a few months?,"So I recently got laid off. I've been strongly debating wether to look for another job soon or wait it out a bit. If I were to choose the latter option, I would study some certification in my field (IT) to increase my employability when I return to the job market. I spoke with my office of unemployment to see if I would qualify for financial assistance in taking online courses; I am setup to meet with a counselor this week. I live with a high risk person for Covid-19 and I am concerned about returning to work right away as the state I live in kinda has a lax attitude about precautions. Also, Unemployment with the CARES act would be paying me more than returning to work at the moment (2-3 months). So it's basically get paid more to be safe while getting some additional education under my belt.  Honestly, if it wasn't for the virus, I wouldn't even care about these incentives and I would just return to work. However, I'm worried about this possibly being a worse decision than if I joined the job market right away and my 'too good to be true' sense is tingling. Is there something I'm not seeing here or what would you do in my position?"
Finished college but don't know how to find a job,"I just finished college 2 months ago with a degree in interpersonal communications and a minor in English. I graduated with no internship experience nor I have connections (I spend a good chunk of my college life working at low end jobs to pay off bills and dealing with mental issues). The only work experiences or any random experience I have is the following:

1.Working as a supervisor in a fast food store

2.Cashier and Line cook at a restaurant

3.I made one website on square space

4.Made one 2 minute video from raw footage (basic video editing skills)

5. As a library page

I don't know where to look for a job. So far I've only been going on Glassdoor and Indeed. Don't know where else to look for a job. Half of my friends don't work and my family doesn't speak English, so I can't ask them. I got no connections.

I apply to all types of jobs that are listed as entry level or I have experience in. For example:

1. Social Media marketing
2. Restaurant Supervisor or shift leader
3. Customer service representative
4. Retail jobs
5. Public Relations
6. Receptionist or Clerk
7. Bank teller

Every job I have been applying to are entry level jobs that pays bare minimum and I still can't get a reply back. I don't have a career I want to focus on at the moment because well, I go with the flow. Whatever industry I land in (beside the food industry), I'll focus on that industry.

Also, My resume just list my education, my skills, like knowledge of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and my experience as a Library page and supervisor. I explain what my roles were and how my role was important. I don't really write a cover letter, well because I don't know what to write in it. I google it, I'm still batshit confused.

My question is, where do I look for jobs beside Indeed and Glassdoor. Is there any tricks to getting a job? What should I write in my resume? What should I do? Should I try for a internship? Should I go back to school for another degree? "

Unemployed for 4 months. Only 2 months left before the unemployment benefits end. I've only had 1 interview in all this time. I'm starting to panic!,"Hello everyone. 

Last year I went through 3 jobs. I had made a career switch last April but realized I wasn't interested in the new career. 6 months later I quit and got a pretty decent job in my original field - Public Health. However, I was fired after only a month. I was not fired for being a bad employee. My performance had nothing to do with it, and if I had made it past the 6 month probationary period then I probably would have been successful with my wrongful termination claim.

I was successful in getting 6 months of unemployment benefits and a part time job at a fabric store, but I haven't been successful in finding a new job. 

I've reworked my resume 3 times, but I still haven't gotten any bites. I've got a bachelor's degree in Public Health, 3 years of experience in my field, a lot of experience in Administrative work, high proficiency in Microsoft Office and Adobe, and all of that is on there. 

I'm worried that the mistake I'm making is putting my 1 month long position on there and leaving my 6 month long position off. Am I just making it look like I have 2.5 years of experience, a 6 month gap, a month of good work, and then nothing for the last 4 months? Would it be better to take that last job off and put the 6 month long job on there even though it was entry level and I hated it? 

What else could I be doing wrong? Someone told me Linked In is absolutely essential, but I don't really have many professional contacts to add on there. 

I'm insanely lost and really desperate to find something. Please help me."
"Laid off mid March due to COVID-19, receiving unemployment in KY, offered temporary position for low pay.","Seeking advice here as I want to get back in the workforce but the position I was offered is temporary 80-100 hours selling office supplies on EBay for $15 an hour. They reached out to me because I interviewed for a sales position that pays $60,000 plus commission at their company (similar compensation to my previous position). The employer is waiting to pull the trigger on full time role until COVID clears up. I think they want to hire me for the full time role and this may be a way of locking me in for the short term.

Looking for first job at 22 during the covid19,"Hello all I'm 22 I finished high school and got my hs diploma in 2016.

I applied for Amazon virtual customer service and I got the job just recently after waiting for a little bit more than a month but sadly one of their NDA forms was stuck in my spam folder and I got withdrew due to me not finding that until after the due date.

I've looked online and most of them require extensive previous work or therefore management positions which obviously since I haven't worked I'm not able to get those particular jobs.

The Amazon virtual customer service definitely would help my mom out as it was $15 an hour so I feel extremely bummed about that."
Unemployment and Scam Interviews,"Hi everyone! I’m a little freaked out as I applied to a role on linkedin not realizing that the company is a known scam. Accompanied by a different name texted me (which is already really sketchy since I think that’s incredibly unprofessional unless I agreed to it in an application) saying that I’ve been invited to interview, however it was not one I’ve ever heard of I have no record of an application to this company name.

When I asked them about my application they gave me details that made me suspect the app were taken from the company I thought I had applied for on LinkedIn as if they were the same people. I’m currently on Massachusetts unemployment and I’m worried that if I don’t interview with what is looking to be a scam/MLM that this will disqualify me.

Does anyone have an idea of how best to go forward?

Edit: The one I reported online is the one I thought I had applied on linkedin not the one that supposedly is texting me."

Overqualified but can't find a permanent job for over a year - DMV,"I am almost at my wits end looking for a job. I graduated from law school about a year and a half ago and I have my MA and BA before that. I am in the government/policy end of the law and have been working in policy for over 10 years. That is what my coursework, internships, and jobs in between school have all been focused in and around. 

Since graduating law school I have had three temporary positions, with the last one ending in February. I am getting lots of interview requests and making it to some final rounds but still, no one is biting to actually give me a real permanent position. 

I know I am qualified and can do the roles I am applying for but I cannot seem to land a job. I am so frustrated and dejected. I just don't know what to do anymore.

"Lost my job this week, but NOT because of Covid-19. My employer used it as an excuse.","So as the title states, I found myself in a very strange situation. Tuesday of this week I was laid off from my job, along with 7 others . Six of us were in different areas of IT ( Information Security, DBA, development, administration, etc) The other two were from different states. More layoffs happened in Canada as well. The company specializes relocation and naturally has been hit hard by the current pandemic. So initial you'd think it was because of Covid-19 and business is slow. But during the call with HR and a manager were I was told I was being let go, I found out I was laid off because the company and had done an IT Assessment prior to Covid-19 breaking lose. Even the papers they emailed me to sign all point to a company restructure with no reference to Covid-19. But it appears they are using it as an excuse or cover to jettison 8 people on the same day. My manager was also laid off. The company stated they would give a severance package and wouldn't fight an unemployment claim. Anyone else in IT that wasn't laid off say a 10% salary cut. Now that's important because that's the only reference to the current pandemic my employer has made.

Naturally I filed for unemployment but the thing is I had to lie to both the Unemployment office and my apartment complex. I didn't lose my job because of Covid-19, they are restructuring and used this pandemic to do it.

I'm looking for work currently but I'm curious if anyone has ever heard of this or dealt with someone similar? I've done what I can for now, just wanted to get someone else's perspective. Seems pretty sleazy to do it this way. Now they've made unneeded stress and anxiety in my life."
Is relocation a valid reason to reject an offer even if you’re unemployed?,"So I finished my master’s degree last year. I’ve been living with my parents and job searching since around October. I’ve applied for about 200 jobs, done about 20 phone screens, probably 8-9 full interviews, and just received my second offer. I rejected my first offer at the beginning of February because the salary was so low I wouldn’t be able to support myself, had no benefits, and would expect 60-70 hours of work for me weekly with no paid overtime. 

This next offer is a little better. The personnel were incredibly friendly and warm (it was nice to be treated like a human) and even negotiated me a slightly higher salary without me even asking. However, that salary is still only $35K a year and the benefits are very mediocre. Furthermore, the position is far more niche than I was initially expecting, and wouldn’t give me any of the transferrable skills I’m actually looking for for the career I’m trying to pursue (it’s pure developmental writing for social work education curriculum, where I’m actually looking for a job in copy editing or copywriting in a business setting. My entire background is already in academic writing and I don’t want to pursue a career in it). The small city it’s in also doesn’t really have much of a market for what I’m looking for career-wise, and it’s not a desirable place to live or one I’d want to stay in. 

The city this job is in is several states away, and the job offers no relocation assistance. 

Is there any kind of justification for not taking this? I’m not starving or homeless, though I do have a somewhat strained relationship with my family. I feel as someone unemployed I should take this offer with no hesitation, but I can’t help but hesitate, as it seems like a dead-end job in a field I don’t want to be in, in a location I don’t want to be in that’s hours and hours away from where I live currently. The only thing currently tempting me about it is that it IS a job and the staff seemed nice. 

Anyone have any thoughts? Am I being a dumbass and should I just take it, despite the downfalls?"
How to get a job overseas after a long-term unemployment in my own country?,"First post here. I've been on a rut lately, but some background first:

I was a MBA graduate, with an undergraduate background in marketing. Because of some screwups (both my fault and office politics), I am currently unemployed for 4 years. I had a background in marketing research and advertising, but I did dabbled as a local freelance cinematographer/video editor (because that is my 2nd main passion and I loved it more than a corporate life, but it failed again).  I know the chances of me getting a full-time job is very slim, and right now it's adding towards my depression. 

To make matters worse, the situation in my own country is deteriorating, and I am planning to move abroad should my country's political situation gets even worse. Speaking of my country, the creative industry over there is so bad, uncreative or polarized towards a certain segment. I would love to work in the creative industry, specifically, the media industry. My first choice would be USA, followed by Australia/New Zealand, and maybe Germany or Spain.

Some questions:

1. What is the current creative/media industry atmosphere in Los Angeles/the rest of the States/Australia/New Zealand now?
2. How can I get a job if I am unemployed for 4 years? Would companies care?
3. How can I get a visa in the US or any other countries in this situation?
4. What are some of the best jobs for an entry-level person in the creative industry?"
"Currently unemployed, anything I can work on while I'm looking for a job?","I'm a recent MBA grad and I've been looking for a job for the past ~6 months.

I've looked into business related certifications (PMP, SCMP, Lean Six Sigma etc. ) but they all seem to require a minimum level of hours within that field (which I don't have) or that you are currently working in that field (which I am not). I realize the answer to the question is going to depend on what direction I'd like to take with my career, but broadly speaking, and there any business related certifications/courses I should be looking into that would not only boost my resume, but also give me a positive explanation for what I have been doing in lieu of working for the past several months?

I worked from  November 11, 2019, and got laid off on March 25, 2020. NY is telling me that I have not worked long enough (quarters?) to qualify for unemployment. 


Is there anything I can do? Any help would be appreciated. I live in New Jersey by the way."
"(23m) Communication graduate, four years unemployed.","Get all the jokes out of the way early, I know my degree means fluff.

Now to specifics. I'm in my fourth year of no full-time work. Over the years I have honed my applications, resume and interview tactics to a fine art - the problem is, everything comes up green except the actual job. It started with a marketing position at the head office of the company I currently work for (casual). After taking me under their wing, the state manager pretty much guaranteed me the job (""apply for this and you'll get it""), and then right through the interview process was ""your resume is outstanding"".

I didn't get the job.

So I didn't give up. I kept applying through tonnes of rejections, until I conveniently found another job at my current company. Again made it right through to second place, being told everything was perfect, even when I asked for feedback.

I didn't get the job.

I then found a startup company, who loved me. They even said they went out of their way for a second interview because I was exactly the candidate they were looking for. They excitedly told me they'd be in touch until I received a phone call in a regretful tone from the hiring manager.

I didn't get the job.

I turned to free internships and free labour as a means of getting my foot in the door. The companies used my ideas I pitched to them and gave other individuals the actual internship (this one especially stung as my ideas were splashed all over their websites).

Today I just scored a second interview with a new job, and was praised for my ""entrepreneur attitude"". The problem is I'm worried history is just going to repeat itself a fourth time. I get it, that's the job life, but four years unemployed is not normal for even my unluckiest of friends.

**The Problem**

I feel like it's a literal impossibility to me to get a full time job now. Over the past four months I've submitted easily 80+ applications and tonnes of internship enquiries. Either they are ignored, rejected or lead nowhere. I can't even find opportunities to gain experience as they're either targeted at uni students or any mentioned as any demographic but me (white, straight male which has disqualified me from several internship opportunities).

I can't afford to go back and study as I can't even pay off my current uni degree loans. Worst of all my casual job has started removing shifts so I may as well be unemployed now. What do I do? Where do I look and how do I keep up hope?"
2 months of looking for a job and now struggling.,"M - 27, foreigner, living in the UK for the last few years.

Came to the UK a few years ago, worked a temp job for a year, then decided to do a degree here (Business-related degree) and graduated with a First Class. Then right after graduation ended working a year and a half in Finance (entry level job, entirely different area than my degree - just how things turned out to be). 

Decided to leave last December - no career progression, support, lots of stress in the last few months and I just decided to leave without finding a substitution (had managed to save some money for the next few months ahead, for cases like this). I was quite a good employee, everyone was happy with my work, but I wasn't feeling too good internally.

2 months later, registered with most major recruiters, been to 6 interviews (finance roles) and on each, I almost get the job. However, I always get rejected at the last stage and for my last interview, they even told me I was overly qualified for the role. Been thinking - did I shoot myself in the foot by leaving without finding a substitution?

As you can expect, I am really starting to get depressed. Based on what I've shared, do you thing I will be able to find something soon? Is 2 months unemployment already alarming? What am I doing wrong? I always go to the interviews quite confident and prepared.

Many thanks for any potential opinions."
"Getting interviews in my field with open to relocation, but am currently homeless.","Hello, I recently graduated with a CS degree and I relied on dorms for housing. I currently have two part time jobs but am actively getting interviews / on-sites for jobs that are all at pretty varying distances in different directions.

Today I got fired from my job. I don’t know what to do next.,"I have had a difficult time finding a job in my industry, spending over 8 months searching for employment off and on for the majority of that time. I finally landed a job, an hour and a half away from home. It was a huge load off my mind. But today I got into work and was handed a termination letter. 

I’m an apprentice, and at my last job I wasn’t given a lot of learning opportunities. I feel like it was a lot to do with the fact I was always the only woman on the floor. But the fact remains I’m a second year apprentice, and I guess I didn’t live up to this new place’s expectations. 

It’s already so hard for me to find a job in my field. I’m so distraught, I’ve had a great track record until now. I’ve never been fired before, let alone not even having worked for the place for a month. I don’t know what to do. I love what I do and I didn’t want to go work flipping burgers but I guess if I have to I will. I just don’t know, man. But right now I’m so not okay."
My spouse (22f) has been out of the workforce for several years and is unsure about how to make her resume look good.,"My wife has been unemployed since 2016 due to wanting to focus 100% on undergrad school work. Having a one income household has certainly affected us a lot over the years, and just continues to put pressure on us when it comes to our bills and other expenses. 

She is wanting to get back into the workforce soon (probably part time) while she continues with her digital media/animation degree. Unfortunately, her resume is looking a little empty due to this long gap of unemployment. Her last job was a temporary position in 2016.

Are there any ways to make her resume look good while not having a lot of job experience? She is definitely a hard worker, an A/B student, and is willing to do what it takes to help out our family. It sucks that jobs won't take that into consideration when looking at her resume just because she's had to take a break from working for school."
I feel pressured to lie about my employment gap. What should I be saying?,"I’ve been unemployed since July. I didn’t quit for school - rather, I was let go from my corporate position in April and did temp work through July.

Since then, I’ve re-entered graduate school in a field I was more interested in.  I did so because I had been struggling with finding a permanent, full-time position with my experience since April, and I figured I could transition to a career I really wanted.

I’m currently in my second semester. I have had atrocious luck finding work, because retail managers know based on my resume that the work is temporary for me, but appropriate positions (temp and full-time) haven’t been pulling through.

Fast forward to this Thursday. I’ve been working with a recruiter, and she’s been extremely helpful (rare, I know). I interviewed at a place that was the best fit I’ve ever had, based on their culture, location, compensation, and growth opportunities.

The first person I spoke to, my would-be manager, loved me. The second person also seemed to really like me, but he asked me what I’ve been doing since July. I told him I was in graduate school. He didn’t seem to recoil at all, but Friday I heard from the recruiter that they really liked me, but they were afraid that I wasn’t looking to work “in a permanent position” because of school. I’ll have to wait until Monday to hear the results.

The thing is, I didn’t feel comfortable saying, “oh there’s a gap here because nobody wants me” eloquently. And so it feels like I’m being punished for being unemployed *and* for filling up my free time with something.

I’m going to stick to my story here. It’s the truth after all. But what else can I say to future employers? Why is a situation like mine a red flag anyway? I’m just trying to get my career back on track."
Should I take a low-paying warehouse job or wait for unemployment?,"Like many, I was recently furloughed from my position as a Logistics Coordinator for a tap room/brewery due to the virus.  I just applied for an online delivery service to work at several positions, some office and some warehouse.  I already received a call about an interview for the warehouse position, even though my experience and my desire is to wait and see about the office positions.  The warehouse position is a huge pay cut from my previous job and would require me to work all hours of the day (not sure how many hours total).  I applied for unemployment in my state 2 weeks ago and still haven't gotten the requisite info.  I can't get through because their phone lines are famously jammed, their online chat is similarly jammed, and their email requires 7 days to get back to people.  Ideally, I would just sit on unemployment for a bit until I got desperate enough to take a job like this, but with the current situation, I really don't know when my next paycheck is.  What should I do?  Should I take the risk in ruining my unemployment that may never come?  Or should I just be patient and ride this out for a little bit longer?"
"After applying to 200 companies, I finally got a job offer but I am not sure if it's wise for me to take it.","So I finally got a job offer and its with JCPenney's HQ and I will be a process engineer for them.   
So I will be compensated accordingly for the work that I will be doing and I am truly happy that I got a job in my field. However, I am from a different state and that means that I will have to travel down there, get rent, etc.   
My biggest concern is with the direction that JCPenney's headed. Looking at the news, it keeps saying that JCPenney's going out of business and that genuinely worries me. I don't want to work for them for less than a year and be jobless in a state that I don't belong in. What should I do? It's my dream job but idk if its the right company.   
And i also don't want to decline it either because it's my first real job offer and I really need it. I mean as long as the company doesn't go under within the 4-5 years, I can definitely manage but until then that's reality, I'm not sure.   
please give me advice on whether or not this is the correct choice."

Am I screwed if I've been unemployed for almost 6 months?,"I graduated college in May, took a seasonal job for the summer, and then had a couple of medical issues to address that took a few months. Looking for a job now, but I've been out of the workforce for almost 6 months now. I've heard that being unemployed for 6 or more months is a big turn off for employers and makes it harder to find a job - is that true for someone who is a college grad but hasn't had a full-time job before?"
Recently fired and don't know how to proceed.,"I am new in my career having just graduated in 2018. I was an IT project coordinator and realized I needed IT experience to properly do my job so I left my previous company in September for a new job. It was entry level desktop support and I had no experience coming in. My new employer knew this and said they would work to train me. When I arrived, there was another guy starting on my team doing the same position as me and there wasn't really enough work for both of us. He also had a lot more experience than me.

Things went really well for about two months and got along really well with the team and my managers. Thirty day review came in and everyone was happy with my work and was told that I had great customer service. On day sixty, I passed a major certification test and had my 60 day review later that day. It was not a glowing review and I was told I need to work on my attention to detail and that they wanted to do a special 77 day review (never a good sign).

On day 77, I was written up for more attention to detail issues and told that I was about to be fired. To me these issues were more related to learning an entirely new skill rather than not caring about details. I am a perfectionist by nature and while I can and do make mistakes, I do care about details. I was told that my probationary period was extended by an additional 60 days. I decide to work hard and keep the job despite the very toxic threat of firing this early on in the training process. My goal was to work for about a year and then leave the company.

During this time, I was a nervous wreck. Next two reviews go really well and I was told that the company was happy with my progress and they like where I was at. Things seemed really good again..... until out of the blue I was fired right before my probation was up. The reason was that clients did not want to work with me because of interpersonal communication skills but that was never fully elaborated upon. I signed an NDA, got two weeks of severance pay, and was escorted out of the building. 

Applied for Unemployment and that is still in review. Highly doubt that I get it because the company is now claiming I was disobedient and rude to my colleagues and managers. That doesn't really matter because I just want a job to support my wife and I. The company says they would give a me a good reference and even wrote me a positive review on linkedIn. They have down as a rehire so I can have new employers call and feel good about hiring me but now I don't trust them.

I have a manager at my last job before this who mentors me that says I should leave it off my resume. He says he will just tell whoever calls that I got laid off and I can say that I have been looking for work while on severance. Not sure this is the correct route to take but I feel like I have to leave this job off my resume. I was only there four months. I have been depressed for the last month because I gave everything I had in terms of effort to that job. I am just now puling myself together. 

What do I do?

TLDR: Fired from new job after four months and was told they would give a good review to the next company. Not sure what to do next."
Thinking of going back to my old job thoughts?,"Ok so I'm used to working retail! I worked at certain job (dont wanna mention which one it is) for 3 years and enjoyed working there! I ended up quitting cause I was moving up north but two months before I quit I had a huge mental break down! I would randomly cry and had panic attacks which made me mess up a huge order! Everyone understood but still I get embarrassed thinking about it! Anyway it's been a bit more then two years, I'm back south and  wanna go back! My supervisor said I'm always welcome back but that was 2 years ago! There was also a certain incident that happend to me which I thought was crazy! But dont wanna talk about it! I did give my two week notice! Any thoughts?"
I was let go and I feel a little embarrassed and not sure of next steps.,"I was recently **let go 3 weeks ago and I feel embarrassed but I want to move forward so I can score a job soon.** I'm not sure of how to come up with my narrative to friends, network and prospective employers why I was let go in my job search so they can still think positively of me. Please help?

**Why I was let go (background):** I've been at my job close to three years and I hated the job, I hate writing long reports and I didn't like the work I do but I kept going because I didn't know what I want to transition onto next. A lot of independent silent work and little collaboration, which I realize I loved. The company has been going through some changes and a lot of roles have been terminated (though not my department specifically I was only let go, which adds salt to the wound). The only thing that kept me going was the people that were there but a lot of people left (even my managers who voluntarily quit without anything lined up who would've vouch for me). The work load was getting excessive and quality was compromised as my performance hindered. Main things that added to me losing my job is that I missed catching a data mislabel mistake in a large report  before I sent over to the client and being late or missing meetings. I can own up that its partly my fault but I also was so tired of the place and toxic environment and working into the late evenings. The director who I had to work closely with clash with me in terms of personality and often says abusive stuff really lowering my self-esteem. My immediate manager does acknowledge that if I don't like it there I'm not sure why I'm still there.

**One of the things I struggle so much is explaining to networks and friends on my situation or even how I'll approach this in an upcoming interview, it's hard to say to employers I'm just not passionate or I'm simply overworked and tired and environment was not great. I've read online I need to own up to the situation and not blame the company when explaining why I was let go. Any advice on the narrative? Should I update on my LinkedIn now that I don't work there?** They are still paying my severance and won't be updating my record of employment until my last paycheck. **Below is an attempt on how I'll address it, please let me know if you have any better strategies or suggestions.**

**Long answer they ask why I was terminated if HR asks?**: It was not a good fit, a very high-turnover and dysfunctional work environment as the company is going through changes in a new direction. Over the course the last year I was there many people were terminated and left which shifted a projects over my capacity, which I admittedly struggled and really affected my performance. I learned that work life balance and culture is important to me though I understand there are times where certain milestones that requires extra time. I do prefer an environment where there is regular engagement and collaboration instead of silos.

\- the problem I think with this answer is people leaving and high turnover happens in a lot of companies and they may feel I'm not fit for the job. Thoughts?

**Shorter concise answer (networking or to simplify for others)**: I used to work in market research but I realize it’s not exactly a great fit for me and I’m exploring new career paths in customer experience, project/product management and analytic roles."

Destroyed my career - what to do now?,"So, here’s the story. 

I’m an angry person at times and people know it. I’m baited - I bite and return fire. This has cost me one or two jobs in the past, but I’ve always had something to fall back on. 

This time it was worse. Construction project prestart and I’m getting hassled by my team - I lose it, get up and leave. On the way out I throw my paperwork on the desk of a woman and tell her where to go. She stands up, with my clipboard, and swung it two handed at my face - contact was made, decent hit. I throw a jab back to her jaw. 

I’ve now been black listed in my industry - and have no transferable skills.

Been Job searching for two months... running out of hope,"&#x200B;

So I need to preface this story a little. I worked for a startup in the SF Bay Area as a Business Onboarding Specialist for about 7 months and some change before being laid off in September of 2019 ( We went through a messy acquisition and a large portion of the company ended up getting laid off :/ ). Shortly afterward I took some time off to travel and in October I took a contract position that lasted until December. Since then I've been feeling a little hopeless. Most of my experience in my work career has been as an Account Manager for a real estate company. I apply to a minimum of 20 jobs a day, most are startups. It's currently the middle of February and I am going crazy due to not working. I have some saved as well as unemployment so I don't need to find a job right away. That being said it's incredibly demoralizing to watch my bank account slowly drain every month. I've been using this time to work on skills ( I've learned SQL, some Python, as well as some inbound marketing skills. I've also been taking classes to finish my bachelor's degree as well) during this time in hopes of finding ways to make myself more marketable. I understand it's still early in the year so I may be overacting but my apartment lease is also up at the end of May and I do need to have money saved to move and at this right, I won't have enough since I've been paying the rent with my savings. If anyone has any leads on any sales or operations roles for any startups in the SF Bay Area I would greatly appreciate it. Feel free to DM and I can shoot over my resume and my Linkedin as well. Also, I would love to hear stories on how you guys have mentally survived to be unemployed."

How Do I Explain Why I Was Fired in My Unemployment Interview? (URGENT),"So I was fired from my job recently in a way that was... kinda shitty. I worked at Target for just under two years, but last few months had been rough. Low hours, anxiety-induced stomach problems, car accident, weather making it impossible to get to work. I got fired two weeks ago and it was allegedly due to calling out too much.

But I hadn't called out in awhile and last I'd heard, I'd been doing better? 

My mother has just been hired at the same Target and both she and another employee at Target thought that maybe it was because of that rather than anything else, seeing as how there had been nothing huge that occurred between my last 'conversation' that officially had to do with any missed work and my termination.

I live in Kansas, which is an at-will state I think, so they can fire me for whatever. But because I was fired and there was, at least ostensibly, some prior work-related issues, I have to have an interview to decide whether or not I actually get unemployment.

How can I explain the circumstances in a way that isn't overtly salty/conspiratorial, but also doesn't make it impossible for me to get unemployment?"
"I am currently collecting unemployment benefits after being fired in December. Recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder... what are my next steps, if any?","I am in Florida and I was fired in the beginning of December.  I have been collecting unemployment as I try and find my next job.

In 2011 I was diagnosed with clinical depression. Middle of December after getting multiple second opinions, I was told that I was misdiagnosed and I am actually Bipolar not depressed.  I started treatment immediately and dropped my previous medication for depression.

So my 1st question is.. do I have to do anything with my current unemployment benefits situation? I am pretty sure one of the questions on the application was do you have a disability of some sort and one of the disabilities listed was bipolar. My 2nd question is, can I apply for additional unemployment benefits while I start this treatment (most meds  for bipolar don't start to show effect until 6 weeks.)."
"Applying for jobs in the past month, no call backs. Should I go back to my old job at a different location?","Stuck in a funk when it comes to getting any callbacks. Have emailed and called establishments asking to speak with a hiring manager for updates but they either: don't pick up the line or don't reply to my messages.

I left my old job because of my coworkers. I should have noticed when I was being promoted and offered raises against people who have been in the business YEARS longer than I have to save myself literal headaches and dread coming to work to leave, but I didn't. I ended up assistant  managing over people who didn't like working, and a manager who didn't like actually disciplining workers because they were ""needed"" (all of my write ups and disciplinary actions had to be approved by them).

Long story short, I quit, got a new job, and quit that one shortly after. Money and time are really stressing me out the past month and a half.

- I cant drive/never learned how, so I have issues with reliable transportation in that area or able to have the ability to snatch a job that requires driving
- I have month to over a year gaps in job consistency and even when I did have a job, I’d have to quit due to unreliable transportation/sudden city to city moving and also would get fired for lack of performance under high stress(so unstable with lasting jobs)

-Job areas ive applied for(retail, fast food, cafes, restaurants, shoe/book/clothing stores/shops, grocery stores, pharmaceutical based, hair places;think sallys, at malls, movies, post offices, etc)
- I live in a college area and not out in the city so most jobs are taken by either those in college or those who have a lot of stable job experiences 
- Ive sent out emails, called places back(to be told they aren’t hiring even when their stores have a hiring now poster up), re-applied to jobs(well over 30), applied both with and without resumes, etc and all of them keep telling me they found better matches or aren’t hiring

I need urgent help just got fired from my first job out of college.,"I graduated in mechanical engineering. I got hired for an entry level position as a project engineer at a company. I worked there for 4 weeks and I was never assigned one task besides a research project from a different department manager (design engineer manager). My project engineering manager from the first day only had me learn the company and that’s exactly what I did. I read all their books about their field of work and I gained a tremendous amount of information learning their business (plastics). However out of the blue today I got fired. I asked what for and HR and my manager simply said it was a business decision that we felt like you weren’t qualified enough or had a technical understanding that we would expect from an engineer. My manager only ever once mocked my engineering education because I didn’t know what a Socket shoulder cap screw, when he was showing me machine parts. 

The department I was working under sales department were all filled with boomers. All the employees including my manager with 50+ and most of them did not have degree’s just apprenticeships and got into the trade. I worked with 2 other young coworkers who had mechanical engineering degrees. One of Em was there since he interned and the other just decided a few days ago to quit to move onto another job. So the department I was working at is now 5/7 people in their office.

I’m so confused. What do I do? How will I find another job? Won’t other companies see that I got fired when doing a background check? I’m at a complete lost of words. I need to support myself and my parents and payback my student loans. I had other offers lined up and decided to take this one because it was close to home and the best decision for me.

Please help me any and all advice is very much appreciated I am only 21 years old and located at an At-Will State."
Current job said they will fire me if I don’t improve.,"Okay, this situation is a little complicated.

TLDR: I’m about to get fired but it seems like a pretty amicable situation and my manger even promised a good review. I could likely collect unemployment. I have interviews lined up and need time off for that but there is no way I could get time approved. Can I just call in sick or will this hurt chances of unemployment / strain the remaining relationship I have with my current job?

————

My current job said they will terminate my employment if I do not improve by February 20th. I am trying my hardest because I always try not to burn bridges, but honestly this is kind of a blessing. I genuinely hate this job, and have already been searching elsewhere for new employment. 

Even if I do improve to their standards by the 20th, they then would want me to come in office which is simply not feasible as I live too far away (I work from home currently). So no matter what this current job is pretty much out the window. I would just leave on my own, but I can’t afford to lose my job without unemployment or another job lined up.

That being said, I have secured quite a few interviews for next week - unfortunately, the interviews are during when I’m supposed to be working my current job. My current job offers no PTO at all and any approved unpaid time off must be scheduled several **months** in advance. 

My main question is: **If I have to take 2 “sick days” in a row for these interviews, will my chances of unemployment be hurt?** I’m not sure what do. I obviously want to attend the interviews no matter what since losing this job is pretty much inevitable and I need to prepare, but I also don’t want to screw up my ability to collect unemployment if the interviews don’t work out. I know if people are obnoxiously late all the time or call in sick too often it can sometimes be considered termination for cause. I have 100% attendance besides this. Is 2 days enough of a cause? The speed of my performance is the reason they are wanting to let me go, but it was nothing that would make me seem completely negligent, just “not a good fit” for the role. I finish at about 80-85% of the speed they’re expecting from me. I don’t think my performance issues count as a cause by themselves. The can fire me for any reason as this is an at-will state, I’m just talking about “causes” in terms of unemployment. 

I’m also scared of going the route of telling my boss that I have interviews lined up and need time off for that. Getting fired is pretty much a guarantee so that isn’t the concern, it’s just that her and I still have a decent connection separate from my performance and she did previously agree to write a good review and a letter of recommendation for any future endeavors. I would hate to burn that too by just bailing, could even hurt my ability to get the jobs I’m interviewing for lol. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Help plz lol"
"If given an interview, should I mention that they would be my very first job?","I am looking for a first job, but I'm not sure if I should mention that in an interview. 

Also, does anyone have tips on scoring a first job? 

I'm a recent college graduate. I've applied for all sorts of jobs, but seldom hear back from anyone."
Am I at a disadvantage to finding a job because I'm out of the workforce?,"I've been searching for a job for 4 months now. I've had a few phone screens and interviews, but they ultimately lead to nothing. Am I doing something wrong? I'm getting really worried that it's only going to get harder to find employment with my resume gap growing 😥 I graduated college and got a temporary job as Assistant Director for a summer camp, but now I'm looking for full time work."
Boss threatening to fire me over things outside my control,"Hello, I am from Australia and I work as a crew member for a fast food restaurant. I have been working here for around half a year now, and I feel like I am an excellent employee. I greet customers/take orders with a friendly demeanor, I prepare food and orders immediately, I am never late to work, I am fast paced etc. I can't see any issues with my performance.


So my issue is my manager/boss has given me a 'last chance' warning for something completely out of my control. When taking orders from customers, the order appears on screens throughout the building regardless if the order has been completed or confirmed. I presume this is to save time so the food can be made whilst the customer is ordering. The problem occurs when a customer changes their mind before the order is paid for. 

For example:

1. Customer orders a meal with a chocolate milkshake. 

2. I enter the order onto the machine, and then tell them the price.

3. The customer then goes 'oh actually can I get that with a vanilla milkshake instead?'

4. I adjust the order and then they pay.


Since I started working here, I have seen this happen multiple times per day without fail. Only over the last few days has my manager come up to me and started blaming me for the order changing. She basically said to me 'the next time it happens, you will be fired'.


I am honestly scared to go to my next shift because I feel like I can be fired at any moment for something out of my control. I would say that she is looking for an excuse to fire me, but it could also be that she just reacting badly to food wastage. I don't know. Either way, is this a valid (although dodgy) way to get rid of me as an employee? Or do I have a case of unfair dismissal if I was to be terminated? Thanks in advance."
Should I “give notice”?,I was let go from my job yesterday. They gave me the option of whether I would like to “give notice” that I am leaving the company. What is the best course of action? Would giving notice affect my eligibility for unemployment benefits?
I can't get hired because I have lengthy gaps in my employment. How do you fix that?,"My life has been a bit of a failure to launch. I'm age 30. I've had a few jobs; as a groundskeeper, overnight stocking, and very briefly for a cable company. In between those jobs, gaps that lasted a few years each, I had been attending school. But after the cable company (in 2017), I've not been employed, or at school, ever since. And ever since July, I have been trying to find work. I've gotten three interviews and was ghosted each time. I've been living with my grandmother, but she's not getting any younger. 

I don't want a high tech job. I'd really, really like to just cook food. But I can't even find work at fast food. In one job, I even had a good connection - still got ghosted. I suspect my employment history is what's keeping me back, but how does one fix that?.I'd like to actually have work on that history, but but if I can't get hired because of it, then I'm stuck in a loser's spiral. 

I live in a very rural area. I do not have the money to move. I can drive, but my own car is broken down, and I can't afford to get it fixed. I'm out of shape and I don't think I can do anything physically demanding. What the hell am I to do?"
I’m a minor trying to get a job,"I live about 30 out from the nearest town with a McDonald’s. I’ve taken many trips up there to apply, but it seems like now that the holidays are here,  all the bosses have taken vacations or they are not in and when they are in it seems like they aren’t interested in hiring a minor even though there sign out side says help wanted. The one place that did sound like they were going to hire me said that there might be a job ( over the phone) and he needed my hours. I told him I would text them to him and I had also asked if he could call back to see what shift I could pick up and start working. He ended up not calling me back then I called him the next day (about 1-1:30pm) he doesn’t answer and doesn’t respond to my voice mail I had left him.  Most places flat out told me that they don’t hire minors which saved me lots of time but cut my options to very few. I even signed up on indeed.com just to see if that would help. If I don’t get a job before school starts again I won’t have enough money to pay for car insurance or gas to be able to drive it. Because I can’t get a job my parents think that I’m incompetent in doing anything. And seeing that they are boomers doesn’t surprise me that they are blaming my phone and technology on the problem. I need help BADLY. Any tips any third opinions, I want to hear them all."
Jobs in small cities in England.(Hull),"I just moved to small city and I was a little surprised that I didn't get a single interview.

I'm 18 all GCSE done graduated college worked for a year in sales and moved to this city in England. Well all is good except it's after new years, bad timing on my side. I visited all the shops, shopping centres etc and not a single offer.only thing was go online do it on website, only part time in 2-5 months for weekends.

I constantly apply online for anything that pops out, everytime I get a reply which is quite rare it says you didn't pass to next section.

Any advice? literally I'm applying to everything except factory work however that might soon change.

TLDR
Can't get a job in small city for minimum wage."
Quitting without new job lined up - next steps,"I am 28 studied industrial.engineering and been working in supply chain and logistics for the last 4-5 years. I was at company A for 4 years adter graduating and then moved to company B in October 2019. I was hating company B because of the day to day, very tedious, manual and was dreading waking up every morning. I decided to quit wirhout a job lined up in January because i couldnt take it any more. It was making me sick.

Now i am really lost on what to do. I am looking to apply to a full time masters program starting in August. But what should i do until then? If i find a good full time job i would feel really bad for quitting so soon. But what if i dont get into the program? I am looking at contract jobs but its not easy. Also looking to do an internship abroad for a few months. Please help on what i should do. I really need advice."
Getting hired after long term unemployment,"I been unemployed the past 3 years and Im having struggle with getting hired. I had an few interviews but no luck. I live in an small area and Im currently battling depression. Last job I had was in retail, parents split at the time and I couldn't handle working plus going to high school. Im not sure what to do here, I am planning on starting online college to major in psychology to become therapist but I need to buy an laptop. Need some tips on how to get hired, Im doing everything right during the interview but I think my work history is the problem."
Unemployed for Almost 5 Months. Sent Hundreds of Applications with Only a Couple Interviews to Come out of it. What do I do?,"Hi there, I'm in quite a rough spot right now. I've been living with my mom and my step dad for just over a year due to either getting really low paying jobs, or nothing at all. I'm 22 years old, and I've only worked 3 jobs. The first two I've worked were fine, one being a pizza shop and the other a full service gas station. The third was a truly god awful call center job. Management was awful and the pay was worse. The stress from that job was literally putting me in the ground, so I quit, thinking I could get another one no problem. I've never had unemployment issues before so I never even thought about it. That was almost 5 months ago.

Recently, my parents have been hassling me much harder than usual about finding a job, but the thing is, and what I keep telling them, is that I've applied to just about every single open position in and around my small town, and I've only gotten a handful of unsuccessful interviews as a result.

I recently got my associates degree in programming and web design, and it's always been kind of a dream of mine to work for a big name company and just write code all day long.

My gameplan was that I was gonna use my degree to get a nice-paying job and move out within a couple months, nice n easy. Only, there are hardly any tech jobs around where I live, and the few that become available get snatched up so fast, you'd have to know about it beforehand to have an advantage.

I've contacted temp services, fast food restaurants, factories, local stores, hospitals, offices, schools, groundskeepers, literally any job we have in our town, and absolutely nothing.

And on top of all this, my girlfriend is 10 weeks pregnant! I just want to be able to support them with our own home before our child is born. I'm running out of ideas and wonder what everyone here thinks I should do.

Sorry for the long post, I'm just stressed as all hell and I need to vent, and to hear some advice. 

EDIT: I just got offered another interview scheduled for tomorrow!!! It's at an embroidery and screen printing shop. I know they're hiring like crazy, but are there tips or anything I should know so that I'd ace the interview?"
Advice for a new beginning,"Good day/night to you all! I'm your typical, anxious, unskilled, weirdo who obviously has no direction in life at all.  I'm 20 years old and have never had a job or volunteer experience; reason for this is a combination of laziness, depression (constant suicidal thoughts), extreme social anxiety, a severe stutter that I've had since childhood, not knowing how to drive and not being in shape (underweight). To top it all off I have absolutely zero skills at all.

I'm basically your average redditor haha, question is; what baby steps can I take to counteract this common salvageable problem? A goal of mine is to obtain a job and save up funds, then I'm planning to try out an apprenticeship program for an electrician trade.  The colleges in my country don't have any majors I'm interested in (I don't live in America, Britain or Canada) and I'm just not really interested in college at all.

Does this at all sound wise? Can anyone give me tips on writing a resume? Any social pointers you folks can give me? Thank you all in advance!"
"Underemployment is barely ever mentioned in this slew of positive news of the economy, in both jobs added and unemployment. Do you think it's significant?","Browsing through any news sites you'll see on the front reports of the wonderful performance of the economy, with mentions of great job growth and low unemployment rates. Browsing through any subeditor and it's full praise. But how do you think it reflects the actual reality and economic conditions of people?

I've seen an almost endless opportunity of low end low pay jobs with high turnover (or not). But regardless it's not exactly clear how much of these jobs pay dignified living wages. An economy with low unemployment but large proportion of the jobs are low paying, and part time, doesn't signify something positive.   


The economy seems to be doing great, but hearing from the impression of people, and actually applying for jobs, the wages seem still poor - in relation to living costs and inflation. High paying career oriented jobs are highly competitive, you often have to compete with hundreds of people to land these jobs.   


I mean yes I could go join one of the new jobs added that pay 10 dollars an hour and be considered employed - but is that really meaningful? I just don't buy it. Employers are still as picky as every and the ones that struggle is because they offer awful wages, awful conditions, no benefits. Usually these are the places that struggle to retain workers and have high turnover, but they usually get away with it so they don't care.  


Basically, yes more jobs, less unemployment. Though wages are still poor, working conditions haven't really improved, and the quality of these jobs are questionable."
"Already getting hours slashed and threatened to be fired after less than a month, first job","So I just recently got a new job at a restaurant, between 2 and 3 weeks ago, I'm currently still in high school and this is my first ever job, my boss knows all this, yet before even 2 weeks he was already cutting my hours real short and sending me home early, and telling me it's because I'm doing everything too slow.

Now I do acknowledge that I'm obviously not the most efficient person there, but is that expected after less than 2 weeks at my first job? He said I had this week to prove myself to not get fired, and I got the schedule for next week and I only have one shift, and now I'm afraid he's gonna have me work that last shift before dropping me, honestly idk what kind of answers I'm looking for, perhaps I'm just looking for answers from others if you guys think this is justified. Maybe at this point I should be much better? I'm a lot better than my first day that's for sure, but another kicker, we got 2 new guys, hired around the same time, one of them has quite a bit of work experience and picked it up real fast, so kudos to him, but this other new guy, he's way slower than me!!! Last shift I had with him, he did everything at what seemed like half my speed, yet he's getting way more hours.

Now one thing to mention, if this might have an effect, I'm the only minor there, everyone else is graduated, going to college, or trying to develop some other career, and most people they have working 6-8 hour shifts, maybe I just don't fit in well with his wanted schedule

Again, I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of this post, but if anyone has any questions to further diagnose the problem, or any suggestions, I just feel lost and I don't know who to talk to about it"
What steps should one take after being let go from their job?,"My apologies if this is not the appropriate sub-reddit.  

I suspect in the following week or weeks I will be let go from my current position.  My general plan, in no particular order is to:

1. begin searching and applying for new jobs \[friends have already reviewed the resume\]
2. pick up a part time job that can provide some income \[such as driving for Uber\]
3. look at whether or not I may qualify for unemployment \[I suspect I will not\]
4. engage the local community and volunteer/get involved/network more

Is there anything else I should be considering?"
Live in work/// travel work in the US,"Hey so this is gonna take a little context. Im a 21y/o american who set out on an adventure from my hometown about 7 months ago. I rode across the US on a motorcycle, made it to L.A worked as a editor for a bit and then bought a plane ticket to Vietnam. Travel and stupidity in Vietnam meant that I ran through the rest of my cash, and with the virus they shut down all the schools meaning the only work opportunity out here (english teaching) is obsolete. Im coming back into L.A sometime soon to pick up my bike. But I'm gonna be dead broke and essentially homeless, I've heard about people working on farms and grapevines up in north cal but I cant seem to find anything about that. Ive put some testers out on workaway. Im coming in with only 200 in my pocket, and that makes me n.e.r.v.o.u.s. Anyone know anything about live in summer jobs? Something that will board me up for a little bit? Im thinking the national forest service, the peace corps, americorps, or even the USMC. But I dont know much about any of those application processes and I can't seem to find much literature.

How long does an unpaid leave of absence last in NY?,"So back in March last year, I got a new job, and voluntarily left my old job (I did not quit nor was I fired, I was put on a leave of absence). However, I was let go from the new job a few weeks ago, and I started to collect unemployment.

I figured since I was gone from my old job for about 10 months, it would be classified as job abandonment. (Everywhere I look it says leave of absence only lasts 12 weeks) I spoke to my old boss and she claimed I was still employed and on the payroll, is this possible?

Now I am worried because the department of labor is requesting additional info from me regarding my claim (not sure what, they won't return my calls). Can anyone help me figure this out?"
What am I doing wrong?,"Hey all,

Recently I moved from a rural area to a metropolitan and I'm struggling to find employment. I've gone online and filled out at least 100 applications, and tried to go through temp agencies, all to no avail. Generally with these applications I include a simple but definitive resume along with a note saying I'm looking for immediate employment. I've had two interviews, one for a pyramid scheme and another that told me I wasn't exactly what they were looking for. I moved to this area because of some health issues along with divorcing. What am I doing wrong and what can I do to fix it?"
Lack of jobs everywhere.,"I’ve applied to over 20 places. Everywhere I go they’re filled up for their seasonal, everywhere I go I’m not old enough to be in that position.

"Currently unemployed with several gaps in my resume. 25 years old, no degree, any advice?","I've been unemployed for one year, and whenever I try to edit my resume so I can apply to jobs, I panic and then I freeze due to some of the gaps in my resume, which are long (1 year in general). I don't like making excuses for myself, and that's exactly what it feels like when I try to explain the gaps in my resume. I've been paid to train kids in sports (soccer) and I've worked with my dad before, but otherwise I haven't developed any particular skills in the time that I've been unemployed. Before that, I've been able to hold down jobs for 7-9 months, and I usually only quit due to external circumstances (i.e. commute) which I know isn't ideal by any means, but it's... something.

I don't even what kind of questions to ask, and if it's okay with whoever replies to my thread, then I'd appreciate if we're able to talk in private since I think it'll be easier for me to speak openly about this in private. Right now, I feel somewhere between tense and ashamed. But if that isn't feasible, then I'll try my best to discuss it directly on here.

Disclaimer: I would've posted this on the subreddit dedicated to reviewing resumes, but I don't feel comfortable posting my resume, and I think the assistance I require goes beyond that, but if my thread is off topic, then please let me know, and I can move it elsewhere."

How do I deal with looked down on by friends and family?,"This is my first time in this situation. I've given it a lot of thought to process my own observations.

I'm in my mid twenties and ever since I've lost my first career job. I have not been able to find a job. My total experience is just short of being acceptable. While I feel like ranting about what I have done and still can't find a  job and trust me I used to be don't give up optimistic type of person. But that's another story. I want to talk about how toxic people are around you EVEN if you have savings and supporting yourself somewhat.

- i saw jobs on indeed, did you apply to them. (as if finding job postings was a problem, did i not tell you i've been applying to 20 - 30 jobs a day) 

- go pick up garbage on street if you really can't find a job - family

- man you are not serious about the job - friend (whom i have talked to only 3 times in a year)

- all you have to do is take you resume and walk into any of those store. - neighbor (i did it didn't work, all said apply online) 

- you just dont wanna work (in one year i have had 20 interviews and applied to ~500 jobs no but that must be it) 

- im worried about your future why dont you try (wow... no words)

also i noticed people think it's ok to make you butt of a joke in every joke. i didn't know this was normal. personally job or no job i never looked at person like that. i always started conversations with what do you like vs as what i get now as i grow older it's always what do you do.

i also noticed people think it's ok to belittle you if you ever decide to have fun. going for a walk - yea just walk all day. play a game - grown unemployed men playing kids games. watching a documentary - what episode is this, 100?, did you get any interview today.
try to learn a skill - forget that just apply to jobs.

in short everyone close to you treats you progressively worse over time and your existence serves to only take garbage from all. from parents, to siblings, to friends, to neighbors, and even your barber. ""oh you still didn't find a job, you live with your family smirk""... you're just a lazy mentally disturbed loser and bad influence on a society.

most days im ok, i dont mind having to walk instead of taking transportation. i dont mind never eating out. i dont mind not having 7 years old phone... many things... as i have hope that i only have to get a job and then i can buy whatever i need soon. but what gets me is toxic people. most days i ignore but then some day it all hits you once.

"PSA: If you're unemployed, try and stick to a work-out routine. Your future employed self will thank you.","This is a good time to get fit. You have extra time on your hands. Exercise gives you a sense of accomplishment and uplifts your mood. If possible, club it with job applications to make it a habit. For example, send out 3 applications right after 30 minutes of exercise. Pick up something easy (running, biking, bodyweight exercises), start small. The returns in the long run are huge, both mentally and physically. 

I say this as someone who recently got back on the employment train and now finds it difficult to do anything fitness related consistently.

Hopes for the Future? 18 year old with Petty Larceny Misdemeanor,"To get straight to the point, I made probably the worst mistake of my life and stupidly (but well deserved) ended up with a Class A Petty Larceny Misdemeanor conviction. And worse of all, I was convicted in Virginia, which means I have no hope for expungement. I was just a few months past 18 when this had occured and the literal thought that I had thrown away my life right as it started has brought me to the lowest point in my life. Regardless it was a necessary lesson for me that your actions truly have consequences. To anyone who thinks stealing is worth it, IT IS NOT. 

The only thing I can do now in my position is try my best to minimize the damage this charge will cause me in the future. I know that this subreddit is one of the best to get advice from because you give it in a practical no nonsense type of way. No need for sugar coating here.

A few details about myself, I am currently at school and plan on getting a BS in Information systems and Manangement (Double Major). I chose this due to the many career options it gives you as it mixes buisness with computer science. Is this still a viable option for me due to my situation? What can I do in the present and future to help my chances? If you have any advice I am begging for it. What advice do you have for me regarding applications, and background checks?

I'm not good at anything professional,Hi I'm 25 and I've never felt comfortable in a work environment I lost my job at its going to be 7 days before I'm homeless and I'm already penniless is there a way to make money when you're completely useless? im desperate theres really nothing else im good at.

My coworker got terminated today I feel awful for her,My coworker got let go today in the worst way possible. My boss left for the day as he personal things to attend to. He handed my other coworker  an envelope and said to give it to our part time coworker. At my lunch hour I wrote him with my concerns over her work product as I was her supervisor. I get an email about a half hour before the part time coworker was supposed to leave that today was her last day. My coworker was all giddy saying see you guys next week. Took the envelope from My other coworker than walked out the door. She opened the envelope in her car came back crying said she has been let go. It was heartbreaking but not a total surprise as she would only complete one task a day. She was balling when she came back to get her things. I just can’t stop thinking of my boss not even meeting with her and just giving her an envelope. What if she wouldn’t have opened it? I have a feeling that due to my boss not liking conflict he chose this way.  I have been on the receiving end of firing. It’s not pretty. Is it wrong of me to feel like I should start looking as the way with this is handled was not great?
"How can I get an online/work from home job, since I can’t seem to pass an interview to save my life?","I’m trying my damn best to get a “normal” job but I’ve had so many doors closed on me over the past couple of months that I just feel drained and demotivated. I can’t even get a retail job because I’m terrible at interviews. Most recently, I interviewed at and got rejected from a charity thrift store where I already had some prior/ongoing connections through the charity with volunteer work, so that one really stung :/

I want something I can start working on *now* where I don’t have to pass what feels like an impossibly high barrier of the application and interview process. I keep hearing “if you are physically capable of typing at a computer you can work,” so where do I actually find those jobs?? I’m tired of being considered lazy and want to be doing something, just about anything.

Info that may or may not be relevant: I’m lightly on the autism spectrum. I think this contributes to me doing badly in interviews because I can come off as cold or unenthusiastic when I’m really just scared out of my brains. I am pretty functional in most other areas of my life and have learned to adapt to a lot of scenarios socially, but I think job interviews are one particular area where my weakness and anxiety in social interactions starts showing through.

I also have some “side hustles,” which are editing event photos and tutoring classmates at my college. I was able to get into both of these side jobs because there was no formal application interview process, just someone who happened to have a need that I heard about and was qualified to help with. When I reached out and introduced myself, I felt a lot more relaxed and was able to click with their personalities well. I was able to make much better first impressions because I felt more confident and wasn’t afraid of rejection. I was the first choice just for being the first to reach out and they would only look for someone else if something had happened to not work out between us. Because they had given me that first chance though and because there wasn’t someone “better” to compete with, I was able to prove myself through my work quality and ethic.

The problem with the above is that the work just isn’t consistent enough to create a dependable income. My main photo client reaches out to me when they need me to edit large shoots every few months, and tutoring is on hold until at least early next month due to summer break for our course. I also take up other freelance work/odd jobs when I can, but of course those aren’t consistent either.

Edit: thank you everyone for all the suggestions! I don’t have time right this second to reply to everyone, but I will definitely look into some of the ones that may be a good fit!"
How do you record the jobs you have applied for?,"Like do you use Excel? What are the headings? How often and what are the ways you go about finding a job?

Terminated From Current Job While In Final Interviews,"So, I'm in an extremely weird situation right now.

Things have been quite shaky recently at my current (now-previous) job to the point it was becoming mentally overwhelming to come into work every day. In response to this I've been applying and interviewing for other jobs for just shy of a month now.

There's a job I'm currently gunning for in which I've made it past 3 phone interviews and was just notified I was selected to come in for a final interview. I'm fairly confident I can get this position, as I don't believe I have allot of competition. I was approached by a recruiter for this role and it doesn't appear that the company has it listed on any job boards / websites. I've also hit it off really well with everyone I've interviewed with on the phone, including the CRO of the company who would be the one making the final decision.

Now, here's my weird situation: I was still employed when I began the interview process for the job I'm trying to get, but when I came into work today I was pulled into the office and notified that I was being terminated from my position due to inconsistent performance and being a bad fit for the company. Admittedly, I'm pretty sure my job found out that I was applying and interviewing with other jobs as well.

How do I approach this? I want to do everything in my power to ensure this doesn't negatively impact my chances of getting this position in any way. Should I proactively bring this up? Should I only mention my sudden change in employment status if prompted?

Any advice would be appreciated!"
Pay stubs,"So I was recently working at tacobell and I had to quit my job very shortly after getting it. When I was working there, I didnt have a bank account so they gave me a card with bank of america money network. There was a verification problem with my address, and so they put the account on hold. I need to send them a copy of pay stub with my address on it. I called the taco bell and asked if I could go and get a copy of one from them. They said to make an account on greenshade and i could access them from there. The problem is, it doesnt show your address on the website. The problem with the pay stub is that since my mailing address and my home address are different it shows the mailing address. Is this the address they are looking for? I sent the pay stub to their email and I'll see if it worked, but I dont know if I did this right or not. I dont know what to do at all honestly. I live in central Texas."
Got fired... but I'm free now.,"I've spent the past 7 months at an extremely toxic job where I spent the workday being gaslit and mentally abused by my desk mate.

Today, they let me go after numerous emails from my desk mate about what an awful employee I am. Any time I've asked for help, it's dismissed or ignored. (I was even told I ""wasn't allowed"" to have help at one point) Last week I started discussing the possibility of hospitalization or partial hospitalization due to work/job stress putting me in a really terrible state. (I walked out and went to the ER a week ago because of the toxic coworker)

I was already planning to resign and move back across the country, but was trying to hold on until I had a job lined up. Unfortunately, I have no job offers yet, but I'm leaving a month earlier than planned and hoping it'll work in my favor, should employers start calling.

I made the decision to leave my current industry, as it's made me something of a ""bad job magnet"" - literally every job I've had after graduating has been so toxic that I usually don't even last an entire year. I'm terrified because after working in so many abusive situations, I don't trust anyone in any given office.

Good vibes, advice, and encouragement are all appreciated. I'm experiencing a lot of mixed feelings right now."
Got a second paycheck after being fired,So I got fired from Papa Murphy's over 2 weeks ago now. I won't get into the details but the following day I got what I believed to be my final paycheck and everyone who I talked to about it said it would be my final. Now we got paid every other Tuesday. I decided to check my balance just now because I am waiting on a refund and I see 96$ when I only had 10$ last night. Is this a mistake? And if it is should I take it out before they take it back?
I don't know how to move on from my unemployment,"I recently graduated from a Psychology undergrad in July and was so excited and motivated to get into the job world. I quickly got a job as a Support Worker and my initial plan was to have this job for maybe a year in order to gain experience working with people with mental health experiences. A week in this changed to 6 months and then I quit 5 months later (it was less than 5 months but lets pretend its 5). 

So that was a month ago and, I don't know what I'm doing. It sounds silly but I feel almost...too scared to go back to work? I would go into work with so much anxiety because of my coworkers and now I'm scared because I fear that'll happen again. Not only do I not know what I want to do now, I definitely don't want another Healthcare Worker role, but I just don't want to get another job. 

I've applied here and there to places because I know I \*NEED\* a job but I think I'm so scared of being stuck in a place where I'm getting constant anxiety attacks that I'm not really trying. Like I was scheduled to have a phone interview today for a Lab Technician (a job I know I would have died to have) and I just didn't pick up the phone because my heart was racing and I was too scared. 

How do I get over this fear? 

&#x200B;

And bonus question, how do you figure out what you want to do? I want a job where I'm not dreading going in everyday and I'm starting to think that doesn't exist."
Got fired during probation. Leave it off the CV?,"I got fired during my 6 months probation period and I worked for only 4 months in a pretty well known organisation. The reasoning behind me getting fired according to them is I am not a good fit for the company (don't know what that means and why they didn't figure this out during my interview). I relocated from another country to take up employment here and now I am stuck as I have to repay them the relocation benefits that they offered. So I need a job at the earliest before I get into debt. 

Do I leave the company out of my CV which will create a gap of 1 year from my previous internship or do I keep it and explain that I wasn't a good fit for so & so reason?"
Job Relevancy - Employment Hunt,Greetings. I have family member who is currently unemployed and I wanted to help them find a new job. My question is what type of occupations are suitably relevant to apply for with over twelve years of experience as a former Director of disability services. Like would anything oriented around administration and management in the medical industry work or does it have to be specific? I'm a simple college student without much knowledge of how the work force operates so any and all insight would be greatly appreciated involving this subject matter. Thanks.
I got fired from my office job today,"Last month I wrote this [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/br9q07/i_feel_like_a_broken_adult_because_i_cant/) caterwauling about how much I hated my office job. Today I was officially let go due to unsatisfactory performance.

Remember that scene from *The Office* where Jan gets fired and is stuck between trying to be elated, and unstoppable hysteria? I don't know if that's how I'm feeling right now. Because I *hated* my office job. It was soul-sucking and killing me. Every day I tried to think of positives but as soon as I stepped foot in that building it was like waves of despair and grief breaking down on my neck.

So now without my job I feel free, cliche but like the entire world is my oyster. I have time to do whatever I want. I can get a part-time job and write on the side. I can eat when I want. I can go for runs, I can sit outside on my balcony with a cup of coffee and watch the sunrise! I can take free online courses to better my skillset.

And so I need advice again. Everything right now is incredibly loud and I can' seem to organize my thoughts on what to do. I planned on taking today to just kind of settle down and accept this reality; clean my apartment, prepare lunches for my boyfriend, decide what of my office crap to keep.

Those of you who have been in this position before, what did you do first? What was most important?

Here's some info:

* I currently have about $5,000 in savings. I unfortunately do not receive severance under these circumstances but I get one last $1,000ish paycheck and a cash out of my vacation time which might equal another $1,000ish. My debts are about $1,000 per month.

* I plan on filing for unemployment asap.

* I have a wonderful boyfriend with a stable job, of whom I already owe a substantial amount of money. I don't want to rely on him but I know he will be there for me.

* I think I have a money market fund so at worse I can tap into that.

* I live in a large city rife with opportunity!

So any words of caution, advice, good fortune, are appreciated here. Right now I feel sort of numb. Don't know how tomorrow will be, but this is a sink or swim time in my life. I don't want to return to a 9-5 office job."
Career prospects seem lower than they were before graduating college,"It's been close to 3 years and the only places that took me were a call center that axed me when their seasonal period was over and the military, which outprocessed me after a training injury. Low GPA of 2.7, only a few jobs from college working in customer service and sales, and a useless degree in biology... seems like all I need is a bullet to the head. I've reworked the resume, proactively reached out to companies I applied to, applied to positions that nobody would seem to want in places that nobody would want to live, still nothing. No criminal record, no disabilities, but no opportunities or potential. Weren't we all supposed to make it?"
"[52F] Struggling to find work before going bankrupt, Out of options and don't know what to do.","First I'd like to say I've been unemployed since early December(no other income, exhausted all savings) . I had no other options other than to relocate back to my home area from Florida due to financial hardship. Also, I have no family(my son and I are all each other have). Thank goodness he was able to find a decent full-time job/good hours, etc. Upon returning back to my beautiful quaint community in TN, I have submitted, submitted, applied, applied to numerous companies for positions I know I am qualified for. I either get turned down or no feedback from the places I apply to. I am a professional loyal, quality employee with people skills and proven work ethics (always worked in a hospital setting for 26 years as a medical transcriptionist). Since the technology has progressed so quickly, Voice Recognition has replaced the career of human transcriptionists for the most part. The community has recently been hit very hard with a so-called MERGER of the two competitor healthcare systems here. Basically it's a monopoly situation and has destroyed the livelihoods of so many people(100s of nurses cut, cut employee's wages, physicians are suffering as well and the list goes on and on with the politicians having their hands in this BIG MESS).

As I continue job searching, I find myself starting to realize that finding a traditional in-office atmosphere here in this area is almost impossible. I don't have the option to relocate anywhere. I have researched and read about ""Remote, at-home"" type jobs like virtual answering services, virtual receptionist job. My question is, has ANYONE had any experience or know if this new technology is REAL or a SCAM? I've read several different companies and clients are quite pleased using the ""VIRTUAL receptionist/ answering service"" to improve their overall business so as to never miss inbound calls. I need to find a stable income ASAP as time is running out. Again, I've always worked in the professional healthcare world but have found my once great career is no more

DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY THOUGHTS, SUGGESTIONS OR QUESTIONS? 🤦‍♀️"
Is getting fired during probation a massive setback in my career?,"I got fired after 3 months in my 6 months probation period and got told that my skills are not a good fit for the company. I'm really devastated by this since this was my first job after my master's. I'm in the job hunt again and do I leave this job out my CV? Or put it and explain that it wasn't a good fit for both me and the employer? Will this be a big setback in my career or can I get a job again soon? 

Hoping to hear some experiences for encouragement."
"After 6 Weeks Unemployed, I Finally Got A Job","Applied to dozens of jobs, had about 5 interviews and felt the job hunt was going no where. Because I was once unemployed for about 3 months before, I fell into slight depression thinking that that was going to happen all over again. Luckily, I got a call in from another job and the hiring manager called me in. I didnt have high hopes for this one but I actually got the job. Its nothing fancy. Its an entry level job but I was literally on my last dime lol. I had $42 left in my bank account! Just glad I finally have a job now."
What should i start with,So i am going to a high school charter school (17m) and going to be 18 soon. I want to get a job to start my resume when i talked about this to my family they said to not worry about this but with anxiety and depression i just keep worrying that if i put it off i won't be able to find somethine
"My new job now won't start for another month, and I have already put in my 2 weeks. What can I do? I live paycheck to paycheck.","So I accepted a new job for a decent pay increase of about 15k per year. I was under the impression from the recruiter that I would start April 1. However, because of limited onboarding training sessions, I now won't start until May 1.

The issue is that I have already put in my 2 weeks at my old job expecting to start April 1. March 30 is my last day. So I will be going an entire month without receiving a paycheck.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Can I get unemployment? As I mentioned I live paycheck to paycheck and cannot afford to go an entire month without some sort of income...

Edit: Also forgot to mention, I have signed the job offer and everything. It told me the hourly pay and what I would be doing, but just didn't have the start date mentioned. I brought this up to the recruiter and she said that they have openings between March thru May to start. I told her march/april would be the best, but I received a letter today saying that I can't start until may

Edit 2: No luck on staying at my old job longer :(. They said they no longer need help with projects or anything. (I  work in consulting, so work is sort of on an as needs basis. I finished all my projects last week). I am going to get my vehicle inspected today to see if I can start ubering soon. Any other suggestions I greatly appreciate. Also I live in Chicago as an fyi."
Feeling down about not being able to find a job.,"I'm 25 and have never had a full time job, a couple of small time seasonal positions here and there, but nothing permanent or lasting. I know what you're thinking, 25 and never had a real job, what a loser. And I know, I think so too. I spent the last few years not doing much and falling on some hard times, got knocked down, and am only just now trying to get back up. I've applied to like 50+ places that are said to be entry level and not require any experience, and haven't heard back from anyone, I called back and haven't been able to get interviews either, and it just sucks and feels bad. I'm not looking for sympathy, honestly I brought this all on myself for being a moron, but if anyone is reading this, late teens/early 20s, don't let life kick you down and wait years to get back up, get back up right now and keep trying. I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this and if it's not appropriate the mods can remove it, I just really needed to get my thoughts out there, somewhere, anywhere. Thanks."
"Laid off, looking for some suggestions or help","Hello, I was laid off in November. I left a pretty great job with a major company for something that promised a better work life balance and what was supposed to be a safe long term position. Unfortunately it didn't pan out that way. One of the issues is that the last to positions, although one technically a promotion have been somewhat lateral into ecommerce/marketplace management roles out of the digital marketing background that I was originally in.  


I've applied to over 100 jobs here in Austin, and I've had many phone interviews and a couple of in-person interviews but nothing seems to be panning out. Most of the digital marketing jobs that I'm looking to get are in SaaS which I don't really have any experience, I've mostly worked with more consumable type products/companies. The jobs I've found that seem to be the most interested in my have been Amazon related since I've had a good bit of Amazon experience in the last few roles. I'm worried that I've now limited my options to Amazon related marketplace management roles and limited my ability to move to my goal of Director of Marketing/Ecommerce which was part of my 5 year plan.

&#x200B;

I'm around 9 years of experience in the digital marketing/ecommerce field which I figured would be enough. I have a solid track record and good references.

&#x200B;

Is it just bad timing? I've only been looking for about two months now. I wasn't sure if maybe I would have better luck Q1 when there is a new budget and openings for new hires. It seems like right now most corporations are hoarding cash for acquisitions anticipating the economy to tank early next year and holding off on new hires.

&#x200B;

I was making about $100K a year at my old job which allowed my wife to stay at home with our baby. I've been looking for positions in the same range but I seem to be limited to the $85K range now, maybe I was just somewhat overpaid before?

&#x200B;

I would appreciate any suggestions on insurance options, I've explored marketplace but I can't really do that until next year. I'm currently using cobra until the end of the year but I can't continue to shell out $1300 a month for cobra. Is it possible to get insurance just so my child is covered? I've seen some plans but some first hand experience would be appreciated.  


Sorry for the long post, just kind of a lot going on and not really sure what else to do."
"What counts as an employment gap, and how damaging is it for a graduate?","Since graduating last year I've tried to get a job that's relevant to my degree sector and failed miserably. All I've managed was a temporary minimum wage job for two months that was nothing to do with my degree. I have some relevant volunteering from my time at university and a bit since I finished, but that's it.

Will it harm my prospects at degree relevant jobs if I've still not got a job in the sector a year after graduating? At what point do I just give up?"
Relocating for a higher quality of life but can't find a job..,"I graduated in May and have been looking for a job since. I live in NYC but I want to get out of this state. I don't like the lifestyle here and it's very expensive. I have had interviews in Columbus, OH but nothing concrete and now I am thinking of Raleigh, NC, since I heard very good things about it and liked it when I was there a month ago. However, I have no been successful in the job search at all. 

&#x200B;

My question is: is it crazy that I am now thinking of just moving there with no job lined up? I really have no source of income or savings right now. I will be relying on my mom for financial assistance. I am hoping that I can at least find a full time retail job once I get there."
Is leaving a job without another position lined up a death sentence to my career as a working professional?,"I’m seriously considering quitting my job in the legal field without another lined up due to stress and its effect on my overall health. I’ve been hospitalized three times in the past year due to suicide attempts and ideation. There are a few things keeping me from quitting, however: 

1. I need the health insurance. My boss is a very nice person, and I think she would consider keeping me on the health insurance plan even if I quit as long as I pay the premium. There’s no guarantee though. I meet with her on Monday to discuss my employment and if I plan to come back. I might qualify for MA, but I’m not entirely sure how that process works. I’m unmarried and don’t really have any assets, just a car and $2500 in the bank. My boyfriend and I figured as a last resort, we could get married so I can be added to his health insurance plan. He’s definitely Mr. Right for me, we would just be doing things earlier than we might have wanted to.

2. I’m worried that not having a job while searching for a new one with severely impact the hunt in a negative way. My aunt thinks that this isn’t such a big deal since unemployment is low, but I’m not convinced. I might also continue my college education (a class or two, not full time) if I drop to full time. I’m halfway to my BA right now. 

3. I’m worried I will run out of savings before I can find anything. I have enough to cover 3 months of expenses. I have family that will ensure I don’t end up on the street, but I don’t want to take advantage of them.

Advice? Comments? Suggestions? Thanks in advance. I’m just tired of wanting to die. I’m not try to avoid work, honestly. I just want less stress, and I’d like to finish ElectroConvulsive Therapy and the day hospital before returning to work."
Graduated college but having trouble finding a good job. Should I join the military?,"I'm a 26 year old woman in Florida, I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Psychology exactly 1 year ago now. Before I went to University I worked for several years in cell phone sales and did alright but always wanted more for myself than to become a retail manager. I genuinely wanted to become a psychologist or a therapist but I underestimated how much school actually would cost me both financially and energetically--by the time I graduated last year, I was fully burnt out on the student life and 30k in federal student loan debt. I was eager to find a good job and start working and making money, and although I attended some job fairs at my University, I really did not see much that I really wanted to do or was qualified to do.

 Part of the reason I chose Psychology (instead of something more marketable like Health/Nursing or Technology) is because I have very, very weak math skills, but my reading/language skills are through the roof. I literally practically failed the math portions on the SAT/ACT but was in the top national percentile of the reading/writing/language portions of the tests, which is how I managed to even make it into college at all.

Since I've been graduated I have avoided going back to typical retail jobs or jobs at the mall and tried to focus on more professional roles. I tried a call center job briefly during college (awful). I served as a substitute teacher for several months before I realized I don't actually want to be a teacher (the public education system is fucked right now, seriously) and it would ultimately cost me a couple thousand to get certified as a real teacher and recieve the pay and benefits (I have no money and no credit options, and no interest in taking out more loans). 

I decided to get certified to work in insurance so I studied for about a month, got a 4-40 license, and worked for a few State Farm agents. I can't even explain how ridiculous my experience with SF agents has been, the most weird employment where the businesses are failing or only a few years old yet the agents are only in the office a couple hours out of the day or don't come to work at all, yet are upset wondering why they are at the bottom in sales in the area. Weird office politics where there's one older person basically running the office for the agent and one spanish person to handle the spanish customers but otherwise extremely high turnover in the office. One office I worked for, the agent told me she had 30 employees come and go in the last two years, but had no idea why (because she was literally only in the office one day a week). A different agent convinced me to decline a job offer with a different company so I could be the only sales person in his office (more money for me and less competition) and then fired me two weeks later (over text message) after paying me half of what we agreed on and having no reason or explanation for what I did wrong besides ""you're just not a good fit"". I even asked for constructive criticism and he refused to give any. Very confusing, infuriating and weird! 

At this point I'm just very frustrated, broke and losing hope in my job search. I always played with the idea in my mind of joining the military  to get some experience, structure, travel, benefits, etc. But if I'm being honest, I'm a hippie and I don't bleed red, white and blue like I know you probably should if you're going to serve. Still, the idea of going on an adventure and getting in better shape, meeting loads of new people, gaining new skills and hopefully making it through the four years with a GI Bill and some benefits at the end, seems like a much better deal than sitting on my computer everyday shooting off emails and applications for $10 - 12 an hour jobs, having no health insurance, and just feeling like a loser. I live with my boyfriend and my lack of stable income is killing our relationship with stress, seems like we'll probably break up soon. My mother died last year and no one else in my family really seems to care at all about me. If I die, I'm pretty sure only my grandfather would be hurt, but he is very old now and will probably pass away soon. I don't feel I have as much to lose as I have to gain.

 Should I do it or is it a bad idea?

Tl;dr: Graduated college a year ago, a good job with a good company has been difficult. My family is pretty estranged from me and my relationship is on the verge of breaking up anyway. Should I go join the military?"
How do you deal with being ashamed for being unemployed?,"I’m a new graduate from university. I have been looking for jobs since graduation and I even enlisted the assistance of an employment consultant. 

However I’m also dealing with serious depressive episodes and bouts of anxiety that are crippling me. I can’t even step out of the house. And it’s even worse when I’m living in a toxic environment at home, where everyone is shaming for “sitting at home” when in reality I’m working full-time to apply and look for a job.

How do you deal with the stigma? "
Getting a job when the cards are stacked against you?,"I'm trying to help my boyfriend get a job. It's not that he isn't trying, but it seems so hopeless with how much stuff he has going against him. I'll spare you the sob story and just say that he's lived with a very abusive and controlling father most of his life, and that he's trying to break away from what. But he has a small list of (apparently) huge problems that make getting hired difficult, to the point that most of the employers he applies to (mostly online) don't even bother calling to say they're not interested.

* He has no professional references or experience (nobody will give him a chance)
* He's too old to get help from most job corps (mid 30's)
* His parents couldn't be bothered to save money for college, but he did graduate high school
* He can't drive (Eye problem he was diagnosed with as a teenager legally forbade him from it. He can't afford to get it looked at again to see if he get that undone. So it needs to be something easily driven to or walked to when his dad is being uncooperative)

I can't help him very much due to living in another state, but I want to do what I can. I'm working on getting a job myself so that way I could possibly get him down here, but I want him to be able to have money and a means for caring for himself should anything happen. Any possible advice is appreciated, but I do have a few questions:

* When is the best time of the month and/or year to apply for a job?
* If we're applying to the same bunch of places, what's the appropriate amount of time to wait between applications or asking if they're hiring?
* Is it easier to get employers to notice you if you call their location or go there to ask in person?
* Is there anything similar to job corps, but for all ages that can help him?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I really just want to help him achieve some sense of financial stability, but I don't really know who or where to reach out to."
Stuck in an Jobless Loop,"What are some tips for gaining a consistent job? I have the experience and drive, but for whatever reason I'm not being selected for the jobs I qualify for.

What can I do to improve this and get the job I want?

"State is calling me in for Re-emplyment Services & Eligibility Assessment and forced to attend classes, but new job starts in 1 month. Need advice!","So, I lost my job at the end of September, and have been hunting ever since. I am on unemployment, which requires you apply for at least 2 jobs per week. Trouble is I procrastinated and applied for sometimes 4 jobs 1 week and a job the next, but I always met the grand total. I fudged the dates in my self reports. 

Now, I am being called into my local unemployment office to review my resume, record of job searches and applications. I am also being automatically enrolled in classes. If I don't attend both, I lose benefits. I am both worried and frustrated. Worried that they will check the dates I recorded with employers and I will lose benefits, frustrated because I JUST accepted a job, but it starts Dec. 1. 

Questions:
1. Is it common for this to occur after 1 month on unemployment and not working?
2. What are the chances they will verify my record with employers?
3. Has anyone been in a similar situation on fudging dates? What were your repercussions?"
I have never had a job and I am almost 30 years old. I have just taken life day-by-day since I dropped out of college 8 years ago. I live with my parents and they pay for everything for now but eventually it will be unsustainable. What should I do for work?,"I have spent the last 8 years just chilling on the computer, watching shows, watching YouTube, walking outside, eating snacks, napping. 

My standard day is like this:

* Wake up whenever, yolo 
* Make some oat meal
* Watch some Youtube videos
* Read reddit
* Take a nap from all the activity 
* Wake up, eat some pasta 
* Go for a walk outside 
* Shower, take another nap
* Wake up, eat some curry 
* Watch some movies with my dad or play video games with my dad
* Sleep for the night

On the weekends I go with my dad adventuring to the markets and fishing (I do not know how to drive, never got my driver's license). 

However, my dad pays for all my food and I get free place to sleep. Eventually this will end has he is pretty old (74 years of age). What should I do to get into the work force? Most of my credits are in accounting, but I hated that major and that's why I dropped out."

I started with the company in an entry-level tasting position back in early 2016. I have worked as a sales rep for the liquor brand in an ""at will"" state for about half of my tenure. 

For the first year as a sales rep, one of the owners was my general manager / mentor. Over the following 4-6 months, his authority was shifted and I received a different manager. To be honest, when that news was shared with me and the rest of the company, I was not the only one concerned with what might be going on (restructuring). A few weeks ago, I was called into a meeting out of the blue. (Just the day before my manager made me promise to take an extra day off that week since I was holding meetings on my day off) Seriously; when she called HR in with us, I thought we were going to talk about the raise I requested back in August.

Now, please remember that I have NEVER been written up or ""talked to"" while employed by this company --I was informed of two reasons for my dismissal:

 1. A buyer/bar owner expressed concerns about my consumption on company time. The thing is: 2 months ago I started taking anti anxiety medication. After a few weeks, I realized I should cut out the boozing and keep it a drink or 2 every couple days (in my industry 6-10 drinks in 1 day isn't super odd). So in the last month and a half, I can guarantee I didn't cause a ruckus. I'm also just not that type of drunk.- when I asked which account complained or date and time, they could not tell me. 


2. I voilated a from the employee handbook, which is cause for immediate termination: I was accused of coming into our showroom intoxicated. -- I have NEVER done that... At all. The assistant manager of tastingroom couldn't believe the accusation when I asked him about it. Yet again, they could not tell me when this occured. They already had my checks but not one piece of paper work showing any sort of problematic behavior. 


My manager was very kind and was very clear that I have her support and a glowing reference. Our HR lady was crying, gave me a hug and I'm pretty sure hinted at claiming unemployment (hope I don't have to appeal). No one knew of this happening aside from the ceo, hr and my direct boss. No one I have told could believe it especially those that know me well. 

I'm still in shock but I saw no to need to fight and cry; they had their minds made up. the ink on the checks was still warm from the printer so it definitely wasn't planned. 

But yeah... Unemployed for the holidays is definitely not stressing. At all. "
Dealing With Isolation From Being Out of Work and Sabotaging My Interviews?,"Long story short, I'm a recent grad who worked in their job for 2 years before there was a reorganization and I was fired.  

I've been out of work for a **year** now and as a result have had to move in with my parents. Home situation is kinda toxic and there's not much communication. As a result, I've forced myself to get out even just to hit up the local coffee shop and clear my mind and ""be out in society"". I've tried to start attending some meetups and make some friends in this new city but I feel like I've started experiencing anxiety and even panic attacks sometime when I think of not being able to find a job...and with all the recruiters ghosting and lousy phone interviews...I feel lucky to have 2 friends right now but its **extremely** **lonely**. 

I **don't** want this to be a barrier. I'm willing to get out and work on myself. I've always been a social butterfly and make friends easily but now I'm finding it hard. Sometimes I'll be practicing for interviews and I feel like there's so much noise in my brain that I'll go insane and if only I could just talk to someone. *I'm worried that because I've been so isolated during interviews I won't be able to clearly articulate myself or come off rehearsed in my interviews. I've been practicing for interviews and my problem is that I feel like I'm not able to articulate myself well* if I don't communicate with anyone for a long time. It's the same effect on someone who comes out of solitary confinement. 

 I don't want to become so socially isolated and allow this to become a barrier to entry again into the workplace. I haven't had a setback this large and I'm really trying to stay positive but how can I find a way to go about this. **Has anyone been in similar situations or have any suggestions on how to go about tackling this issue?**

&#x200B;

On a side note,  Q1 is apparently really good for landing new jobs? I wouldn't know."
how to get new job after being fired..,"hello! was hoping someone could help me with the current situation im in.. 

Around a month ago I was fired from my job, I had been working there around 4 months and the reasons for letting me go was that I wasn't progressing enough, my manager didn't feel he could trust me working on my own, and that the hospital didn't ""have the luxury to further train me"". My manager also mentioned that ""my personality and everything was there and that i would be better suited to work in a bigger hospital. A little background.. Im a recent respiratory therapist (graduated in 2018) and this was my first job in the field, I had moved 8 hours away from my home town by myself so it was a pretty big risk which unfortunately didnt work out which is discouraging.. I have been applying to jobs in my field but also recently got a part time job working at a job NOT in my field for the time being...

how can i bring this up in future interviews? I want to be honest but realistically can i be hired again since this happened?

I have also been applying for jobs but not getting offered any interviews.. is the fact I only worked there for a few months a potential reason why?

thanks so much for any help!"
"I'm a full time employee and they are letting me go at the end of the season, should I file for unemployment?","I guess due to budget cuts they are letting some full time people go when the seasonal people leave, should I file for unemployment? For clarification I worked through last season."
"Sent out hundreds of resumes, got rejected from the two jobs that bothered to put effort into me. Now starting the whole process all over and I feel absolutely exhausted and crushed.","I feel like an absolute failure. I have a good degree, did a bunch of things outside of school, worked for a leading health organization in another country for a few months, yet can’t find a job in the US. It’s so freaking dehumanizing to go through all this effort. I had my hopes up for one job and just got the rejection call. I feel hopeless and lost. I need to move and get out of my hometown. I’m falling behind all my friends. I had all these high expectations of myself that I can’t even meet, and might need to realize I’ll never be as good or talented as I wanted to be.

Am right back to submitting endless applications, and completely not looking forward to probably ANOTHER 6 month long search with no end in sight."
Incredibly lonely without a job,"Edit 2: I just got called in for a job interview next week. Wish me luck!

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your kind words of advice. I really appreciate you all taking the time to help me.  I'm going to look into some volunteer work and keep trying to get a PT job while I look for the right career opportunity.  Thanks again. 

Not sure if this is the best place to post this so I'm sorry in advance if it's not.

I've been unemployed (and actively looking/interviewing) for about seven months now.  Over the last month or two the rejections and the massive amounts of time I've been spending alone have really started getting to me.  Does anyone have any ideas of things I can do to beat the loneliness of not having a job?

Before unemployment I was a full time student, held 3 part-time jobs at my university, and was really involved in different university organizations. I enjoyed the first few months after graduation a lot, but I'm really starting to miss being around people and having things to do.  All my friends have jobs and my boyfriend lives about 3 hours away so I'm basically home alone all day, watching Netflix, writing, and applying to jobs (and getting dozens of rejections emails, of course).  I just don't know what to do anymore."
54 and starting over.,"I'm 54 and have been with the same company for 28 years. I am a Compliance Specialist and due to changing regulations and technology the writing on the wall is my job will be eliminated in a few months. As I look for comparable jobs in the same field they require a college degree that I don't have. In company my experience and work knowledge was enough for me to progress up to a managers position for several years( that position was eliminated a few years back). I always thought I would finish my career at 64, however the changes in the industry have put that goal at risk. So where do I start ?"
"Searching for 6 months, no contact from employers","A friend of mine has been searching for a job in a new area (medium city) for about 6 months. She's applied \~300 jobs that she was at least partially qualified for, and many that were ""perfect fits"". She has 5 years of experience in her area. She's gotten expert (in and out of her field) advice on her resume and cover letters, she's tailoring her resume to each job to get by ATS, she's adding as many people related to the jobs she's applying for on Linked in as she can find (with no response), she's been to the local job center, and she's gone to networking events for her field.

She hasn't gotten a single callback or interview in all that time.

At this point she's desperate. Are there any guaranteed jobs someone with a B.S. can get?"
Very embarrassing but I’m still unemployed after a year since graduation,"I made a throwaway because of how embarrassed I am.

So I have a degree in digital marketing and I can’t even land an interview (haven’t landed one since December of last year).

Some background I:

-Graduated with a 2.8 (not good I know)

-Had 3 internships over 3 semesters (all in a related field) 

-I’m currently apprenticing in marketing

-I have a portfolio and professional website. I’ve been told repeatedly by professionals that it’s a good portfolio

And I’ve had nothing. It’s frustrating because I don’t work and I live at home. When I get rejected for jobs (like the four I’ve gotten interviews to) I’m never told why. I get a form rejection. Every time I follow up asking why, I don’t get a response so I stopped asking.

I’m at 100+ resumes, 4 interviews have come out last year and none at all this year. I do reach out to recruiters and personalize my resume and cover letter. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

I really can’t afford to go back to school and my grades weren’t good enough to enter grad school. I’m just at a loss.

It’s killing me too. I can’t make friends and I can’t even start a relationship because I’m always asked what I do for a living, and when I say I’m unemployed people just assume that I’m not trying hard enough. It feels really patronizing because I’m doing all that I can and it’s still not warranting anything.

**Edit:** Can we be civil please? It’s a shame that I have to ask this on a **career driven subreddit**, y’all should know how to act. I know this is the internet and that you probably want to be an asshole because you can’t be one in real life. But find someone else. I’m asking for help. Not generic bullshit or ignorant responses.

**Edit:** Secured interview. Let’s make it happen."
I finally got a job after MONTHS of interviews,"After numerous in person and phone interviews I finally got good news this morning! My background check cleared and I start work Monday morning! 

I interviewed with this company about three weeks ago, and got the news that they were going to follow through with me a week after that, and this week they were doing my background check ( which for some reason I was freaking out about even though I’m clean except for some speeding tickets). I’m excited to finally work again after not working for the past 5 months. You guys are the first to hear about this since nobody knows yet ( not even my husband). I didn’t want to tell anyone just in case I would jinx it or something but I can finally let people know now! 

For those that are on the job hunt don’t give up! Keep applying and sending out those resumes. I know it’s hard especially when you have a family that’s depending on you. I’m fortunate enough to have a great husband who’s income is more than enough for us to live comfortably with, but I know it was still hard for him.  I send you all good thoughts and good luck on your job hunt!"
Convince me not to quit my job without a plan,"I am so incredibly unhappy with my job. I won't write a sob story. I hate it. Management is terrible. Customers suck. About 10 staff quit this month only. It is very understaffed very miserable, I hate it. I have been looking for 3 months now actively applying for jobs. Nothing. I went part time recently and got a huge pay cut because I just could not do it full time anymore. It was mentally exhausting and burning me out to depression. It is getting back there now even though I am only working 20 hours a week. Two more people quit today and its been a terrible day. I need to atleast have some income in and I can't risk it with only $1,600 in my savings and bills being $500 a month. Please help convince me not to walk out of this job today."
Feeling even more depressed after getting constantly rejected,"I’m going to sound really pathetic right now but I’m 25 years old with no job experience whatsoever. My brother started working at Dunkin Donut when he was 16 or 17 years old, but even as a teenager I did not try to find a job. Why? Because I was so stupid and lazy and it’s coming back to bite me and I feel so embarrassed and ashamed. This semester, I’m taking a break from university because my depression got severe and I needed to get counseling. I promised myself I will work on myself more including taking care of my physical health and finding a part time job so I can gain experience as well as contribute just even a tiny bit for my family’s financial issue. Since, May I have applied to many different jobs. Only one called me back for an interview and even then I totally messed up during the interview because I got scared and couldn’t think of a good answer immediately. I totally blame myself for the situation I am in right now. On my resume, I wrote down other things that could be helpful like having a research position at school, having leadership position at clubs, having experience with customer service through volunteering at the hospital’s store. I also created a blog for one of the biggest Asian entertainment website and tried to talk about my experience with public relations. But my work experience is totally blank and I continuously get rejected. I tried to keep positive and keep applying but after getting rejected so many times, I feel like I’m not good enough for anything. And why should I be? There are far better people with more experiences than me so I totally get why I’m not getting anything. How can I improve myself? What steps can I continue to take?"
Hello Everyone! yesterday I got fired from my two year job.,"I would like to get unemployment, seen many site but don’t know which one is legit, does anyone know where I can start? Btw I’m in Hollywood Florida. Thanks in advance!"
"Embarrassing question: How to start applying to jobs/creating a resume with no degree, basically no work experience and being unemployed for almost a decade?","So obviously this is embarrassing hence the throwaway. Just for a little context, in summary, I've lived at home my whole life, partially because I went through some personal issues and stuff that I'd rather not get into here (extremely luckily for me my parents are way too nice and still let me stay with them) and my last job was pizza delivery almost 10 years ago.

I'm currently going to school (community college trying to transfer to a 4-year), but I desperately need a job so I can get out of my parent's house. I'm just at a loss where to start, or how to present myself in applications, since I have no degree, essentially no work experience and have been unemployed for an unheard of amount of time -- unfortunately obviously I am quite possibly the least hire-able person ever. I don't even know what I could put on a resume. Any suggestions or tips are welcome. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies."
Find a Job Now or Wait For a Better Time?,"I have worked consistently since I was in high school and got experience in the food service industry, customer service, retail, and animal care provider. Unfortunately in February of this year, I had a bad fall and had to get back surgery which was supposed to be routine and about a week of bedrest, but it ended up failing and my recovery time got extended for about a year. I went from being an active rock climber and dancer while employed at a decent job, to needing a cane and not being able to walk around the neighborhood. Obviously I haven't returned to work since and my savings is draining fast from medical bills and gas to drive to appointments.

Now I can walk decently well, can't lift anything but I feel more comfortable managing without a cane and my recovery process is still ongoing. I decided maybe it's time to find a job like a front desk position and panic less about my financial situation, but I found out about two weeks ago that my grandmother in Japan had a heart attack and I bought a last minute plane ticket for December to be with her. I am only planning to be there for a week but if her condition is serious, I will extend it to help her out.

I know I have a lot of things working against me like the physical limitations and having to be gone during two major holidays for my grandmother (Christmas and New Years). One friend said I can find a job now and tell the employers later so I have a secure job by January, but others have said I should wait until I get back from Japan and spend more time in physical therapy. I think I should wait, I have gone to a few interviews but they all rejected me due to my injury, so maybe focus on my grandmother and myself before rushing into it. The financial situation is really stressing me out and I applied for temporary disability with no luck so far, I made some money doing crafting projects but they're not good enough quality to open an Etsy shop for (also supplies are expensive).

Sorry for the info dump, I am just lost right now and some people in my life are labelling me as a bum when I actually am trying to find a job (I'm also a part time student). Right now the only position I can manage is a front desk receptionist or cashier, but my options are limited in this small Ohio town. Any advice is helpful, am I rushing into this or is it time to find a job?

TL;DR- Got back injury, out of work for 8 months so far, no money left to pay bills. Grandmother got a heart attack and I will be gone for Christmas and New Years for at least a week to see her in Japan, wrong time to get job or get one now? I have a couple job applications submitted but so far not much luck."
Anyone feel out of loop In life with their career goals or too old to get into anything ?,I’m 29 and meet people my age who are well into their careers they have the house the promotion the kids and I look at myself and think wow what have I been doing with my life seriously!! It’s depressing and angering to be honest how little iv respected myself and let myself fall out of loop with society.
How do I break into top management?,"Hi all. I have been unemployed for about 8 months now. It’s clear to me that I could get an entry level job but it won’t pay my mortgage. I have been passed over for at least 3 dozen mid-level roles, even with interviews going really well. The only two possibilities that remain appear to be either 1) I need new skills to be employable because I’m not skilled enough to be employed at the moment, or 2) I need to break into a director, VP, or even C-level job. 
I have 10 years tech marketing experience, MBA in Marketing with a minor in MIS and an Ivy undergrad. My last two employers were both generous with pay and extremely stingy with titles. 
Any suggestions for action I can take, books or articles to read, or other reality check to make?"
Unemployed biomedical science graduate: which career path can make the most money with my degree?,"I (22f) graduated in July with a 2:1 and have no work experience whatsoever in the science sector. No experience means I’m struggling to land a job let alone get any interviews. 

I’ve applied for medical lab assistant jobs but have had no luck. I’m interested in bioinformatics as well as being a medical writer but it seems I’d have to do a masters to get jobs within those fields. 

Honestly, any advice for me in regards to different jobs I could go into and acing interviews related to the aforementioned jobs would be grand."
Mental health and not able to work. What to do?,"Hi. I'm 17 and live in the North West of England, Lancashire exactly. I have been professionally diagnosed with depression and have had various plans and procedures to go all the way, if you understand what I mean and have been utilising Simaritins a lot as well as visiting hospital very soon. I am also working with the early intervention team for psychosis and PTSD. I haven't been diagnosed yet however I have a fair few symptoms and traits of psychosis and a lot more regarding the PTSD. 

Because of this I'm not currently able to work, it's not safe for me or customers as I've had bad experiences in the past working (self harm during work as an example) however it's come now to the point where I have no way of making money which for me personally I really want to do in terms of learning to drive, going out, socialising, fitness etc. Because of a lack of money I can't do that. 

I'm only asking here because is there anyway for me to claim any form of money from the government or is my case not a good enough one? I want to be able to move on in life and try to beat my several issues but without money it's really hard to step forwards into adulthood properly. Is there a law which would allow me to claim benefits or something along those lines? And if not is there any other ways I could make money from home at the age of 17? Thanks for the help, much appreciated. :)"
Fiance and I put in two weeks notice and got fired. What is a good gig to make a few extra hundred a week in between jobs?," For extra background, we're college students going into nursing starting at a hospital as CNAs. Old job decided they didn't need us for our last two weeks. We're not in dire straights or anything, but a few hundred a week would certainly be nice for some peace of mind. We can't start early and need to do a few orientations as well as get some boosters, etc for the new job in the next two weeks."
How bleak are my carer prospects?,"I graduated from a public university 21 months ago with my Bachelor's in Environmental Science and my Master's in Climate Science (4+1 program). Since then, I've filled out about 100 applications and I've gotten a few phone interviews and one in person interview and nothing. Since graduation I've had internships with the local city government doing work in my field for 13 of those 21 months. It's valuable experience but only at internship level. Due to the fact that my wife is in a Master's program, I haven't been able to apply out of the area. I live in Southern California. How bad do I look to companies now that I've been effectively unemployed for almost two years? What strategies do you recommend to get a job? I've gone to networking events, volunteered etc."
unemployed 3 years after college (frustrations),"I graduated in December of 2015 with a B.S. in Architecture, and the job search just hasn't been in my favor since. In the mean time, I've been constantly volunteering my time with free labor places, and have been tirelessly trying to learn more marketable skills to put on my resume and have been searching and searching for any sort of job. Everybody I know, my colleagues and friends and now my partner, all have these fancy high-class good-paying jobs, and making good names and careers out of themselves, it seems, and I'm still living with my parents frantic, nervous, and unable to get a job STILL. I'm at my wits end right now, and I'm starting year four of unemployment and I honestly don't know what else to do right now except to just sit here and keep applying. 

I've been out of any sort of workforce for so long, I have no clue how to even break into the job market after a period of unemployment like this. I am clueless. Is there a chance to recover from a three-year gap of unemployment after graduating college? I'm not sure how much my volunteering counts, and I'm not a student anymore to qualify for these internships, but I'm actually taking some classes at a community college right now, and absolutely hate it, but I don't have much else to do right now.

Another problem is that I'm a little lost in terms of career, too, so I'm looking for anything and everything right now. I might be looking in the wrong places since all these jobs listed are for assistants, clerks, technicians... It seems there is not a fit for me anywhere, but perhaps living in a smaller city isn't working in my favor. When I do get the occasional interview, I can't help but to tense up and be really nervous. Interviews are simply not my strongest point.

Being out of the job market for so long, I have no idea where to get help (if I need it), or where to turn to. Submitting resumes to staffing services doesn't even help even though others I know have had success with those agencies. I spend my days staring at the computer hoping something will happen, and nothing really has. Creating and designing and trying to get more portfolio pieces (and doing art stuff I like to do) seems like a bit of wasted time because it doesn't seem to be productive to me in terms of job searching. I don't know what else I can do, and I don't want to settle for just a cashier job, honestly... part of me thinks that's the most I will ever do, and the other half of me thinks I deserve a good job, but I don't feel very deserving after these long years of sitting around unemployed (I know I have a shit attitude, but therapy is expensive and I don't want to do that to my budget again).

Besides the occasional temp job I have had, I've never held any sort of real and long-term job before... I've always been under the impression that I've needed some fancy office job or some sort of professional job that I've never been able to get, and that makes me frustrated because I don't want to waste my existing artistic skills, and want to design and not be holed up inside a cubicle all day... I think. I probably have a really distorted view because I lack such experience, and it's really embarrassing because I'll be thirty in a few years...

**APOLOGIES.** This has turned into a rant, but I've been having such trouble and this has really been getting to my head more and more and more and it makes me want to hide from the world and maybe give up after I spend my days job searching and crying all the time. It's really hard to keep your head up when you cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. Advice is welcome, but I'll re-iterate a few of my questions:

How does one break into the job market after a large gap of unemployment?

How do you keep your spirits (and your self-esteem and confidence) up when all your efforts seem to not work?

What are some interviewing tips for someone with bad social anxiety/how do you get over the nervousness??

Is the job market really this hard to break into (or is it just me... I'm sure it's just me)?

How are you supposed to get a good job with hardly any experience? What more can one do?

How do you properly use staffing services? (and is it worth it?)

What more can I do besides sitting at my computer applying to jobs? (whenever I go into places to inquire about jobs, they just refer me online instead)"
Unemployed and unmotivated?,"So I (23F) just graduated college with a bachelors in sociology. I was just going to go pretty much for the sake of my parents pleasing my parents and them not letting me take a gap year while in school, so I had no time to figure out  what I wanted to do before graduating. I gave it some thought over the summer and realized I want to be a family/marriage therapist and have to go back to school but I don’t want to rush just yet because I needed a mental break because I was really depressed those 5 years in college.
In June I was applying to just retail jobs, got a few interviews and didn’t come out with a job. Now I’m in august and I stopped applying entirely since mid July after I had to go to the hospital. I lost all my motivation and was just looking for something part time until I can actually do my career job. I don’t know how to get out of this slump. I really do enjoy fashion and want to work retail but I feel either overqualified or under qualified for having no retail experience. I don’t know if it being summer makes it the worst time to look as well. I’ve had a couple of summer jobs as a camp counselor and a few assistant jobs in college. I will say I don’t follow up after applying to jobs I just wait. I’m contemplating applying to seasonal jobs so I can attempt to have some form of income but I can’t even get myself to do that. So far I’ve been looking at retail and assistant/receptionist jobs but this month is look kinda slow. What should I do?"
Got fired from a toxic workplace but feel guilty,"I am 25 years old and I recently got fired from an extremely toxic work environment where I was working close to 50-60 hours a week but being paid for only 40, sometimes even on weekends to meet deadlines. It was taking a toll on me but I decided to try my best because it was an extremely well known company. On top of it, coworkers abused me on the internal chat and my manager didn’t pay any heed to it. However, the work culture is pretty well known to be harsh and cutthroat. I didn’t realise it was that bad before I joined.

During the mid term review of my probation they just said that I’m not a good fit for this position and handed me a letter of termination. I sunk and felt even more miserable than I was when I had the job. Now I’m in a confusing state of mind of being unemployed but also can’t help myself of thinking I could’ve tried harder or maybe tried to do things differently. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. Can anyone help me with some reassurance that what happened, happened for the best? Or is this on me?"
"Unemployed nurse, now overqualified for non-nursing jobs. Running out of time before I can't afford my rent. Your advice, please!","Hello, I'm new to the sub, but I'm glad I found it! I will try to keep my post concise. I really appreciate any advice.

&#x200B;

I am 26. I have a bachelor's degree in nursing and have been working full time as an RN for 4 years in various healthcare settings. I am currently unemployed. My previous job was at a large dialysis clinic in one of the worst areas of my city. The clinic was chronically, absurdly understaffed. The patients were literally uncontrollable at times. The clinic lacked leadership and communication from management. Much of the staff just didn't care much anymore, and the ones that did were going crazy trying to pick up the slack and do their best. After just 9 months at this clinic, I developed severe depression and anxiety. I took a 1 month leave of absence and voluntarily attended a 2 week outpatient day program at a local hospital. I quit as soon as my LOA was over. I didn't give them 2 weeks notice. I fully understand the consequences of having done this. I had been actively looking for other jobs for about 3 months when I quit, but did not have a job lined up before quitting. I decided I would rather work an entry level job than continue working at that clinic because my sanity was worth more than my very nice paychecks.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 months, and I am finding that I am not even being considered for non-nursing jobs, most likely because I am overqualified (according to my dad). What complicates things is that I am pretty burned out with nursing altogether. At this time, I am really not interested in direct patient care. I have applied to the very few jobs in my area that don't involve patient care, such as insurance company nurse jobs, but none have worked out, even though my multiple interviews went well. I look often for these types of jobs, but they are very few and far between. I just feel I need a break from nursing for a while to regain my confidence and resiliency.

&#x200B;

When at my previous job, my boyfriend was making about half of what I made, so I paid the majority of the household bills and rent. We don't have enough income to pay our bills with just his income. My parents have gifted us a good amount of money over the past 2 months to help us, and I know they would continue to if needed. Obviously that's not what I want though. I want a full time job. I have done the math, and to pay our bills without help, I would need to make somewhere around $15/hour.  When you narrow the search down, there are really very few jobs in my area that pay close to this, are full time, are something I can physically do, and don't require a specific certification or education.

&#x200B;

How to act in a situation when you know you will lose your job?,"I am currently on my annual leave and one of colleagues just informed me that managers are planning to sack me as soon as I rejoin the office. I have verified this with a senior manager who said they were having discussions about it as well. So it seems like I’ll be shown the door. It has only been 3 months in the office and I’m still in probation as of now. 

How do I act in such a situation? From where do I get the motivation to go back to work? Is it a big setback for my career even though it’s probation period for now? 

I’m having some serious headache after learning about this."
I Got Hired!!!,"Been graduated from college for about two months, now. I was way late to the game in terms of preparing and so I stuck to this subreddit for advice on interviews, resume writing, etc. I sent an endless amount of applications and received three interviews and got two offers at companies with wonderful benefits and great pay for recent grad! I genuinely don't think I could have done it this quickly without the advice and resources on this sub so thank you r/jobs!!"
Advice about piercings and jobs,"Hi guys, so I have never had a job I’m 22 and currently have been on disability for about a little over a year. I’ve been applying to jobs, (without any luck) but I’ve been extremely picky just for the simple fact that I have three visible piercings on my face and they aren’t subtle (bridge, septum, vertical labret). It’s extremely hard to find a job that I know wouldn’t care about them and my fear is having to be rid of them for this weird ideal that its apart of me and my appearance so to work a job that I’ll probably hate and make minimum for it’s risky to me. I’ve been trying to get around this and jump into work from home jobs but that isn’t exactly easy either.

So I guess I have three questions:

1. Is there anyway to get around them, or should I suck it up and just take them out?

2. What’s the secure way to at least land a interview 

3. Is it worth it to get into freelance or work from home jobs?"
My job was taken away from me unfairly,"Hello I have a bit of a weird situation in regards to my work. 

I've been working for a cleaning company as a cleaner for a few months. This is purely a placeholder job until I find something I want to actually do. I have been working as a casual to cover other peoples shifts. Recently I was offered to do part time for 5 days a week cleaning 3 different stations each day. I found the work quite difficult after a week of doing it and sought advice from my supervisor and that this work is making me stressed and if possible when it's available could I find an alternative shift. He said he'd talk to my manager about it. 

On this weekend I get a message from my manager saying ""hey can you cover this train station shift"" the problem was it was my shift and I was confused why'd she'd ask me to cover my own shift. I called her up and asked her ""why do I need to cover my own shift when I've been rostered permanently for this shift?"" She tells me that my supervisor told her I wanted to quit. I said thats not true, I wanted to find another shift but I didn't want to quit it until I could transfer over, and I made that very clear with my supervisor. She said ""oh ok well what shifts do you want"" and I told her what times and stations I'd be willing to do and she said she'd get back to me. 

What should I do in this situation? My manager didn't seem to really care or understand what I was talking about and although the shift is bad I still need to earn some money on the side."
Resigned with no offer in hand,"So I resigned my current current contract in AUS. The job required me to be aggressive and I would rather not be in such environment. I resigned last week and now sitting at home. Questions I have:

1. Should I let employers know Im no longer working at abc company ? Are there any negative consequences of not having a job while job hunting?
2. what should I say about leaving the previous employer ? I dont have any legit excuse and I know its bad to badmouth previous employer.

thanks in advance !"
Job search has been tough but won't give up,[deleted]
How to market myself 42/F,"I have 19 years of professional experience.  I've been looking for a job since February of this year. 

My last professional job was in network engineering but that was just an aspect of what I did - the bulk of the job was data driven resource allocation management.   I worked big projects (as a lead) and what I did encompassed a lot of areas - project management, data analysis, computer programming/scripting, working with databases, and doing data visualization - all of which centered around the management of network resources.   The actual job I did was very niche, and doesn't really exist outside of large internet companies.    I don't want to return to telecom because it was a very tough environment to work in as a woman.  I was thinking that these skills can be applied pretty broadly, but when I go to interviews (mostly for analytics/BI) more often than not the interviewers don't seem to understand how my skills are related to the job they have.   I think when I start talking about network resources people just check out.

Additionally, I think a large part of the problem is that I don't have all the ""flashy marketing"" terms on my resume because my work in telecom didn't involve any of the high level tools that a lot of companies use.    For example a lot of companies will use things like PowerBI for data modeling, but at my old role we just used programming and Excel for data modeling.  I used Tableau for data visualization, but basically everything else I did was through script programming.   So for example when I get a question like ""what did you use for data modeling"" the answer really is, ""we just made a model"".  Basically I have tons of experience doing things ""the hard way"" whereas companies are trying to do things ""the easier way"" by using tools.  I have experience with the process but not with the tools.  

I think it may be that I'm presenting too abstract of a picture for employers to see my value.     Any tips or help would be greatly appreciated.   I'm happy to share more details."
"20 Little to no experience, Job hunting nightmare","Why is it so hard to find jobs? While going through the applications it asks for 3+ years of experience, Have multiple employer references, etc. I dont understand.

Can I collect unemployment insurance in California if I turn down a job in Canada?,My employer was acquired and the new company has eliminated my position in the restructuring. However I'm being considered for a different position in Canada at the new company. If they give me an offer and I turn it down will I still be able to collect unemployment insurance? The new position would require relocating far away from where I currently live.

"500+ apps, 2 interviews, no jobs. Have 3 college degrees. Slowly going crazy. What are my options?","I graduated UCLA (ranked #1 or #2 public university in the nation) in September with an MA in East Asian Studies. I also have a BS in Atmospheric Science, a BA in Asian Studies, and recently got a CAPM certification.

You'd figure with three degrees from a top school and a CAPM I would have some luck, but not at all. I've applied to everything from banks to museums to universities to tech startups.

The only 2 interviews I've had were at a university and at a car rental company.

Nevertheless, I'm at over 500 applications for which I have had 2 interviews, a 0.4% interview rate. I don't know what is average, but this interview rate is so close to 0 that it's barely even worth noting. 

I've redone my resume after every 50 or so rejections so I'm really at a loss as to what to do now.

I've read really conflicting opinions on online resume writing services, and I'm not sure if a headhunter is worth the high prices.

I went to the college career center and they said that they don't help alumni at all, so I don't really know what to do now. My mental state is slowly declining as I continue on as a 24 year old manchild at home with my parents.

 I would prefer not to work minimum wage because at that point, what was the point of spending so much money on 3 degrees? Not like I can even get an interview for minimum wage. For example, I've applied to 3 Home Depot locations on four separate occasions and never got called back.

Anyways, any sort of advice would be great. Thanks"
I need help choosing a new career (ex-lawyer),"A little about myself.  I'm 30-35, been a licensed lawyer for 5+ years.  Short story, while that is still an option, lets just say it's off the table for now.  I've lived in East coast area my whole life.  I have that typical student loan debt that is insurmountable to the point that I hardly think about it.

I really don't know what I want to do long term, or even short term.  I feel like I've been directionless for the last 7 or so years, ever since I finished law school and passed the bar exam.  I can be very focused and determined when my heart is set on it, like I was with law school.  But it's been difficult to find the thing that is within reach that I really want, at least in the area of my work life and career.  When it comes to other areas, I am not finding it as difficult.

I think some of it is just mental blockage and attitude.  But I think it really comes down to not finding the passion in the first place, even though the passion is likely somewhere... it's hard to commit due to all the uncertainties.

I've been often told that I can do so much with a law degree that isn't legal related.

I am passionate about helping others, gaming, nutrition/exercise, philosophy, writing and reading.  I like strategy, puzzles, analysis of facts and scenarios.  I don't mind when the answer is not as clear as day, I think that's important to be flexible.  I want to care about what I do, but it doesn't have to be part of some grand machination.

A couple careers I've considered/considering:Author - more of a long term thing though, plus the returns may not be sustainable for the amount of time it takes... probably couldn't do this as a career alone starting out.

Bartender - I think I wouldn't mind tending a bar, but the biggest issue is I don't want to work night shifts... so I guess this is off the table.  Too many negative health consequences for me if I work at night.

Contracts administrator - Another job I am not exactly sure what it would entail.  But on the plus side, I remember enjoying and being proficient in contracts law in law school.  I think I still have a solid grasp on the basics of the model laws many states base their laws off of.  I have no idea how to market myself to get this kind of job though.

Policy Analyst - This one sparked my interest because it was described as being part of the political process without being the politician.  I don't know anything about this.

Private investigator - Research... helping people on an individual basis...  Not really knowledgeable about this profession.  But it seems like it would fit me.

Arbitration/mediation - I took a class in law school and enjoyed it.  Not sure how to break into this though.  But helping people come to some kind of resolution, outside of court for much cheaper, is appealing to me.

I'm not really sure what I am looking for by posting this.  Advice.  Similar experiences.  Recommendations.  I appreciate anyone who sticks around to read this entire post."
BS in Biology...cannot find a job.,"I received a BS in biology in May and have applied to jobs, internships, fellowships...no word from all 100+ of them. Unfortunately I have no lab experience so I know that lowers my chances of getting anything.

"just got fired, no degree, no idea what to do","I'm a 28f with two kids and a fiance. I just got fired from my serving/bartending job and idk what to do.

Qualified for unemployment but I make too much?,"Sorry for the long post, I felt the information was necessary to understand what's going on. 


So, I filed for unemployment because my job has cut my hours quite significantly (was working anywhere from 39-45 hours a week and now I'm at 24-27 hours a week). 

I filed about a little over two weeks ago. I got a letter in the mail saying I qualified for a certain amount based on the I formation I told them. 
Long story short, I got off the phone with two different people from the unemployment office and they said I make too much money. 
They said I'm qualified but I need to lose more hours. What I don't understand is I've talked to three people prior, at the unemployment office, and they've never mentioned I wouldn't get paid. Also, why in the world would I even get a letter in the mail saying I qualified then get told I make too much?

It's very frustrating. They said I need to make $170 a week to qualify and another person told me I need to make $100 a week to qualify. 
While my mother, a few years back, worked more hours and made more than me. They paid her the difference on the work she missed throughout the week. Did the laws change recently or am I just getting screwed over?"
When you are unemployed do you tell your family and friends?,"I have been unemployed for almost 9 months now and I have not told any of my friends about it. I feel guilty about it, but I feel that telling them will be an even bigger blow to my already low morale. 

Also, I don’t want to tell my mother who is my native country. She has health problems and this news might just make them worse. It’s a heavy burden, but I just don’t have the courage to do so. Do any of you tell your family and friends when you are unemployed?"
What should you be doing between graduating and getting your first job?,"I recently graduated in July, and have had the interviews and such, but my life seems extremely dull outside of that. I especially feel like I am falling being the competition because I’m not used to not being at school. I have been trying to keep my skills up to date (messing around with Python and C++ as I graduated in Software Engineering). What are your suggestions for that downtime between graduation and the first job? Also, what did you guys do to earn money during this time? I feel it would be disrespectful to go get an easier job i know I could get, and then turn around and leave once I get hired in the Software field, if I do."
I'm getting fired today,"Boss pulled me in today and told me they suspect when I called in sick yesterday I was interviewing for other organizations. (He's right, and the interviews went awesome!). He told me he'll likely let me go at the end of day today.

I'm feeling confident I'll get one of the jobs I interviewed for, but I'll make finding a job my full time job until I get an offer.

In the mean time, I have a family though. What are some ways I can make extra money for the next month or so until I land a job?"
"3rd job interview with a rude, racist owner of company","My first job interview with her she laughed in my face after she asked me what I expected to be paid and I gave her a reasonable amount. She also is a racist. I know this because of reasons that I'd rather not discuss here, but because I'm white, I feel like it would still be horrible for me to work there since I would be complacent in the racism by working for her. Yesterday, I went in for a second interview and I told her I'm glad to be back (a lie, but i NEED a job - been unemployed for 3 months) and she said something along the lines of, ""Well you're not hired yet so don't be too excited"". So therefore rude again. I used to be a teacher and trying to switch into business but she kept asking me if I could be her kid's nanny or come babysit for her. That's not the job I'm interviewing for - I'm interviewing for an administrative assistant role. It was very strange. I kept brushing it off and going back to how I'd like to join her company.

She asked me to come in today (it's just after 1am right now) at 9am to get me trained/see if it's a good fit on both sides and I agreed, but now I really don't want to go. How shitty would it be for me to cancel? She has my information and her company is Fortune 500 type so I'm not sure how far her influence in this city goes. 

Also not sure if it's better to stay unemployed and keep looking for jobs (I have a couple of interviews lined up but this process takes a month+) or if I should just settle for working for a shitty person.

Extra info: I'm also in school but only taking one class a semester. I also am not exactly strapped for money, I'm more worried about my unemployment gap... I've thought about using the classes I'm taking as an excuse for why I took a break from working, but I don't know if that is good enough."
Something that annoys be about applying for jobs.,"Is all the background checks and having to pass a drug screen.  I have a clean background but because of Autism I have had the most difficult time finding a job that suits me.  And now to the reason of my posting.

&#x200B;

I tried to get a job at hot head burritos about 2 years ago.  Instead managers at 2 different locations kept giving me the runaround so I gave up.

&#x200B;

Then I find out a month ago that a guy I know who got convicted for selling hard drugs (not sure if also making them), was practically given a job at hot head.

&#x200B;

I find it pretty frustrating that a person that deals drugs is given a job while a person who's never even considered something that illegal wouldn't stand a chance.

&#x200B;

I hate to seem spoiled but this is why I don't bother with job hunting.  Had the same thing happen when applying to work in an Amazon warehouse.  Found out the person doing the interviews was on drugs and even though I passed a drug screen I was told the day before to not come in.  I drove 55 miles for that job and didn't even get it."
"Rebooting your life. Give me tough love, how much will an entry-level, no-skills-required position hurt me if I ever want to go back to working in an office, at almost 40?","As the title says. If this is better for another sub, please let me know.

I need to have a realistic idea of what will happen here. (I'm female.) have a very long gap in my employment record and unfortunately, a history of mental trauma to get past. The trauma is why I haven't been working, in a nutshell.

I recognize I am absolutely not employable in an office anymore despite past experience, unless I want to volunteer or do unpaid internships first. I've retained most of my skills just because I love being organized and do little side projects for myself, but I couldn't prove that without giving away my skills for free and then... I'm not paying the bills.

So I'm looking at the most basic stuff to keep a roof over my head and show I haven't gone off the deep end completely. Cleaning, back-office stuff like data entry. No customer service, I cannot handle that at all at the moment (due to the trauma).

My view is I have to accept that I'm basically screwed for the rest of my life, and I'm not even thinking about retiring, ever. I won't be able to get anything better than those jobs due to the gap and my age, unless I somehow get lucky or network, which I'm not able to do because I really don't have much to offer that I can prove anymore.

Would you agree?"
Recently laid off and looking to make a career change. Any advice?,"I was recently laid off from a digital marketing position in the entertainment industry and have been job searching ever since. The process has been slow going so far with little to no responses to job applications. In the meantime, I've reached out to people in my network and let people know that I'm looking for a new job, so hopefully that will amount to something.

However, I'm thinking about making a switch to a different industry. As much as I love entertainment, I'm starting to question whether or not I'd really be happy continuing to work in the field. I've always been really passionate about traveling, so I've started looking at marketing opportunities in that field as well. There doesn't seem to be as many opportunities, but maybe I'm not looking in the right places.

Do you have any advice for someone who's been laid off and looking to make a career change and/or do you have any recommendations on good resources for travel jobs? Any help is greatly appreciated - thank you!"

Wife Frustrated At The Current Job Market,"Thanks for reading...

I try to encourage her yet she is getting discouraged. 

Any ideas or suggestions?  I'm open to them.

I don't want to get a second job since I'm the only one working yet we want to better ourselves."
"Am I ""un-employable"" ???","I'm 33 years-old, with an Associate's Degree from my local community college in ""General Studies"" (which, thanks to a really stupid and immature mindset at the time and a ""good for (less than) nothing"" Guidance Counselor and her lack of guidance) consisted of a bunch of pretty much unrelated classes that didn't really teach me much of anything useful in the real world nor got me to be ""specialized"" in any one area. 

Sorry for the uber-""run on"" sentence.  As a result of having learned nothing much of use in my 8 years (yes it took me 8 years to get a ""2-year"" degree), I have essentially no ""hard skills"" to speak of, my ""soft skills"" are somewhat limited IMHO (but being ""my own worst critic"", I'm probably ""selling myself short"" there a bit).  But as far as ""hard skills"" go, I'm SO lacking that I've come to realize that despite being a Millennial - I don't know ""jack $#!t"" about computers or technology - which is obviously ""key"" in this day and age.'

I've NEVER held down a ""real"" job, unless you count the weekend summer job I had for two years in high school, so my ""real-world"" experience is essentially limited to a 1-year ""fellowship"" I did at a non-profit that taught me almost no new skills (if any).  I was given as little responsibility as possible.

Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, I suffer from:

\- Spina Bifida (which affects me in a myriad of ways, mostly physical).  It's pretty ""multi-faceted"", but if anyone wants to know more, I could probably go into further detail if you cared to ask.

\- Epilepsy (which is largely controlled with medication, but still something to worry about obviously)

\- An ""unspecified"" Learning Disability (it doesn't have a specific name, like"" Dyslexia, or ADD/ADHD which makes it hard to define or even get people to acknowledge.....the school's fought me on it for YEARS, which also accounts for some of my lacking in education).  I'd describe it as largely related to a lacking in having or ability to develop ""executive function(ing)"" skills.....which just as I read about them briefly to help me write this up, seems like that alone would basically ""disqualify"" me from ever being able to work.

\- SEVERE depression

\- Social anxiety

And I THINK that's it, but I might be missing something.

&#x200B;

The other thing about it is though, I get ""benefits"" from the state (MD) - essentially Medicare (I THINK it's Medicare and not Medicaid).  Anyway, if I make above a certain amount of money from a job (and the number isn't even very high, but I forget exactly what it is) I lose ALL my benefits.  So if I were to work, I would either need to make below that ""threshold"" in money and still live off of not very much money and might as well not even work unless I'm getting other things out of the job like socializing and making friends and perhaps (although HIGHLY unlikely given what I described about my education/skill set) a job that I actually ENJOY (another ""run-on"" sentence, I apologize) ...... Otherwise, I would need to make enough money that I don't really ""*need*"" my benefits, which - let's face it - is highly unlikely at least at this point in time....maybe after years of working and getting promotions I'd make enough - if that were even possible.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I feel stuck between a ""rock and a hard place"".  I'd like to work (in theory) as I feel like a ""leech on the system"" who essentially just takes money from the government (and tax-payers/society) without giving anything back, BUT I also don't want to be stuck in some ""dead-end"" job that I hate doing and dread coming to work every day and may or may not cause me to lose my benefits and potentially result in me having less money on a regular basis than if I were to just stay unemployed and collect my benefits.

&#x200B;

But I digress as it would *seem* I'm getting a bit ""off topic"" here.  What I was really getting at was, given my situation - is it possible for me to even find a job - specifically one that would pay enough that I could support myself without my benefits, without having to go back to school and get like ""tons more "" education and developing more skills?  Because up until early this year (around Jan./Feb.) I'd been looking pretty damn hard (although if I'd had more determination, ""work ethic"" and wasn't so damn ""beaten down""/dejected and just frankly exhausted from everything I've had to deal with in life and especially mentally exhausted when it comes to searching for and applying to job after job and getting nowhere, never making it past the first interview (and interviews have been few and far between) before being rejected.

&#x200B;

And I've even tried (2) places whose job it is to help me develop new skills and ""job hunt"" and learn/develop new skills, but I've ended up giving up on both of them due to lack of success and frustration.  With the second one, we never even got around to actually applying to jobs, they just screwed around with me all the time trying to (or claiming to try to teach me new skills) but it took forever for us to make any progress even in that regard.

&#x200B;

(I'm almost finished).  I know I'm ranting now, but I feel like I've run out of options and am really weighing my options as far as whether I need to find new routes to finding a job, or if it's just not even worth it for me to try anymore and I should just learn to be content living on my ""benefits"".  Especially since I've come to the realization that I'm ""tired"" of learning and trying to develop new skills (which is kind of a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" I guess as far as failing to land a job) and either need help with having the willpower to continue with it or maybe I'm ""beyond help"" really AM the  complete and utter failure I feel like I am, and should just give up hope."

I am willing to do almost anything for work.  I have no pride issues over taking a minimum wage (or close) job.  I do have concerns over my physical health - while I am better I do not know if I could handle being on my feet for 8 hours in a work day.  

&#x200B;

Plus I have marketable skills! So many.  I can program computers.  Most of my last position at the telecom company was writing system engineering scripts for various purposes, moving data around so other platforms could pick it up and utilize it.  I have been a UNIX/Linux user for more than 20 years and have 10 years of experience working on Linux systems.  I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in network/computer engineering.   I can do data visualization in the major BI tools (power BI/Tableau).   And more!

&#x200B;

Given my experience and skills I have been applying for jobs with databases, programming, Linux, and data visualization.  Up until two weeks ago I was getting 4-5 calls from recruiters per week.  In 3 months of searching I have had 4 phone interviews and two in person interviews.   The last in-person really looked like it was going to work out but I didn't get it.  OK that happens.  But for the last two weeks I have only gotten one call from a recruiter for a job that I wasn't remotely qualified for.  Only one application I've sent in so far has resulted in a response. So panic is definitely settling in.  

&#x200B;

I have no idea what to prioritize at this time.   Should I be looking for an ""any job"" no matter what it pays?   How much should I worry about my salary history?  If I take a ""stop-gap"" job will that interfere with my ability to find a professional level job?  How worried should I be about my health when we may not be able to pay the bills in a few months?  

&#x200B;

The real crux of this boils down to: will an ""any job"" affect my chances of getting a ""real job"" down the line?   There is so much conflicting information about this.   I also don't think my chances of getting hired for an ""any job"" are that high given my age/previous career.  They will take one look at me and know the minute I have a real offer I will be out the door."
How do you deal with parents/family/friends who ask about your employment status,"and try to ""help"" you by sending useless job search sites to you / give you unsolicited ""advice"" when you're either unemployed or will soon be and don't need their input?

Example:  my dad sent me an email:

Here's a site you can use if you're ever searching for work.

(link to site with some openings that have nothing to do with my industry or for the few that do, I'm not qualified for).   His job site claims minimum hourly wages of $25-40/ hour in ""part time government jobs"", when in fact it's just an ad he fell for and is spamming me with.   I clicked his so called ""great"" ""recommended"" site and I see zero jobs openings in my field and some delivery driver part time gigs starting at $16/hr.   Thanks Dad, that's not my field and I have my sights set higher (for now).

What I really don't appreciate is his interference.  This email came the day after I called him for father's day.  I didn't mention anything about work and apparently me touching base with him about an unrelated matter, prompted him to think about ""coaching"" me on some useless spammy clickbait site? 

Then, as has happened in the past, he tends to follow up with me about my job hunting ""progress"", when the last thing I need is him checking up on me.   Instead I need to focus on sites and techniques that work for me and do them myself, without parental interference, at my own pace.   We don't even live together, I moved to another state to get away from my parents, I know how it sounds I'm ungrateful, but nothing pisses me off more than a parent who meddles in my life when I don't need him to.   Yes I could just delete the messages and move on, but I don't want to receive anything job hunting related from my family.  Is that too much to ask?"

First Day: When to come clean with the manager,"I have a plan to leave for a masters program abroad in which I'm already enrolled and taking classes (completely legal). 
So I haven't told this to anyone yet at work or during the hiring process because it never came up (until today).

Today during my onboarding call my manager was introducing me to the team and told me about this one girl that ""she won't be with us for long, because she'll leave of masters when the Corona situation clears"" and I thought should I tell him right now?! 
But I didn't. 
Anyways, my next semester will probably be online as well. So I have until march/April 2021 that I can work here. But my visa is going to get expired and I'll need to get it extended from abroad because the embassy in my home country doesn't give it. And for that I'll have to go Physically go there. 

I want to know when should I tell him that I have such plans as well?  I have exams next month as well. 

This other girl that's leaving had been working in the company for like 3 years already. So we're not in the same boat."

How does schooling effect getting a job,I’m nearing the end of year 10 and plan to leave and work full time for a year then move to apprenticeship this may seem a bit strange but I’ve got reasons I won’t get into here but am just wondering if school has any effect on this as in are my grades or attendance record connected in any way to applying for a job. I doubt my grades will be very high so would rather exclude that from the process and a lot of people are saying things like “your gonna have to have good grades so you can get a job” or the such but the job I already have didn’t have any connection to school. Aswell the same question but apprenticeship instead of a job if anyone has any idea. Sorry if my wording is wrong it’s very late at night I couldn’t sleep due to stressing about school and my future also sorry if this is the wrong sub or any other mistakes thanks in advance for any help. Also sorry if the flairs wrong.
"Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the USA, or Canada?","Hello. I'm an international student that just graduated with my bachelor's from an American university. I'm looking into getting my master's degree in mechanical engineering and I'm very confused between getting it from either the USA or Canada. The program I'm looking into is available in both the countries so I'm not worried about that. My main concern is being able to get a job due to the vastly different job markets and the immigration of both the countries.

If anyone has any insight or advice that could help clear up my confusion please let me know. Thank you!"

Thoughts on the viability of marketing vs finance vs computer science,"I am a bit away from going to uni, but i hear lots of good things about computer science degrees and finance, as well as marketing. which degree is better? what is more versitile, has higher pay, and steady growth and job prospects? what is your thoughts on these degrees?

I am in my freshman year on high school, and my strengths are mainly math and science, but I have recovered my grades from a D to a B in computer science and am starting to really enjoy it, however math is not my strong suit. Ditto with finance, as I am interested in stocks and the financial markets, but am bad at math.



I am going into 10th grade next year and will be learning HTML, python, and maybe javascript as a course in school. how much of a leg up would a proficiencies in these languages give me in university?



is computer science over saturated right now"
"Somewhat unrelated, but those of you who took a gap year before college to work and save up money, how did it go?","I just graduated high school and am trying to decide what step I want to take next. I'm currently enrolled in a university, but recently have been considering taking a gap year to work and save up some money.

Does it matter which college I go to?,Currently I am deciding between 2 colleges in which to go for a computer science degree. I live in Ohio and I'm deciding between a local liberal arts school and a popular school called The University of Akron.

How Important is College?,"I really want to do something with fashion.  I'm open to basically anything in the industry.  It's totally my biggest passion and it has been for as long as I can remember.

I'm not sure if anyone here is actually a professional in fashion, but I have a question: exactly how important is a college education in securing a job in the industry?  I'm asking because I don't think I will ever go to college.  There's a valid reason why that I won't share with y'all, but I could go through college if I absolutely needed to.

How bad of an idea is it to skip out on college? Do you know of anyone in the industry without a college degree? Thanks!"

What is the best way to a medical career and degree while working?,"I am an American working in IT, but I want to become a medical doctor, ideally in a different county.  

Mainly, I am looking for advice.  Would it be better to:

A: Save up while working in IT, get a medical degree in America, then move to Scotland or Canada to complete a medical residency and practice.  

B: Get a career in healthcare, either in IT or as a nurse, and work in a position in America that will pay to help me get a medical degree, deal with an American residency (I'd rather do my residency in Scotland/Canada, if possible), and move to Scotland or Canada as a fully certified doctor.

C: Move to Scotland or Canada while working in IT, proceed to get the degree, certifications/residency and practice there.  (I haven't looked into Canadian emigration law too heavily and am not too familiar with how Canadian/Scottish education would work for a professional degree to someone who probably wouldn't be a citizen at the time, I'm also not sure if American schools would look better on a resume.)

D: Get a nursing degree in America, then move to Canada or Scotland as a nurse and proceed to get a medical degree there.  

...or something else?

I'm still in the preliminary stages of researching and planning this career change, but I wanted to ask here in the hopes of getting a wide range of opinions and I'm hoping people will point out things I might not have considered.  

Some other concerns and thoughts I have on this:

Although I am not struggling, financially I cannot afford to stop working or work part time to get a degree in America and may have trouble with the cost of an American education in general.  I've considered continuing in IT to save up for a medical doctorate in America, but my concern is that this would take a while.  I've considered getting a nursing degree and then proceeding to a medical degree while working as a nurse, but have some health problems that may make me unable to handle the physical demands of some nursing positions (I've spoken to several nurses about this), but I am extremely intelligent and willing to work very long hours, so I don't think I'd have any problems with the less physical aspects.   I know some medical facilities are willing to pay some education costs if you're working in an applicable field, so I know nursing would work better for that aspect, but the IT position may work out better in the long run, financially speaking as it wouldn't necessarily require much additional training and may be more sustainable for me physically."
Teaching Degree and thinking of getting an MBA for Career Change,"Hi there! I'm a 30-year-old who has a teaching degree and has been teaching for the past 5 years. I am thinking of changing my career, and I can't help but feel that if I want to make changes to my professional life, I have to get the ball rolling now. I want to change to a non-teaching job.

I am currently saving up to study for Master of Educational Studies in Belgium. I need about 2 years to save up enough. This was my initial goal up to a few weeks ago. Then I read comments on Reddit and also other websites that if I study for MBA, I will find many doors open to me. I did some research, and one of the top universities in my country that offers MBA program is AACSB-accredited, and I really like how they include a lot of practical stuff like projects instead of just theory-based. I can opt for part-time and attend alternate weekend classes for 2 years. 

My question is:

1) Do my initial teaching degree and a future MBA mesh well together and appeal to employers? Is getting an MBA worth it?

2) Also, I am still thinking of pursuing my Master of Educational Studies after the MBA program. Do you think it's redundant in a way? It's been my dream to study in Belgium, and for so long this has been my goal."
I want to go back to school and I'm not sure where to start. Any advice on which path I should take?," 

**Quick background:** I'm from Maryland and I just graduated with a *less than useful* undergraduate degree about a month ago. I honestly don't even want to say what it is... I hate the stigma of calling any degree useless, but I think it truly is useless to me with the new goals I have in mind (even *without* the current pandemic I graduated into). After hearing horror stories about my job prospects without the proper education, I want to get a head-start on bettering my situation before going through years of no job opportunity dry-spells post-graduation.

Currently, through a personal connection, I was lucky enough to get hired to do some at-home part time administrative and graphic design work for a local business. I want to take advantage of this period + the limited mobility I have due to COVID-19 to get some **online** schooling done. My ultimate goal is to break into **Human Resources.**

I can't decide if I should:

**1) Get a second bachelor's degree and pretend the first one never happened.** After doing some research, it shouldn't take another 4 whole years to earn another Bachelor's due to my accumulated credits.

**2) Go for a postgraduate degree.** I've been told that earning a second bachelors isn't the best use of time and money and that I might as well go for my Master's in a more productive field? My concern is that I'm not sure if I have the qualifications to be accepted into a Master's program in my new chosen field . My current degree isn't all that transferable to different subjects :(

**3) Go for certification programs.** This might be the quickest way to make myself a little more marketable. It might make it easier to find entry level jobs and internships I want in my new field. And I can always pursue my Master's at a later time.

**4) Go for an Associates degree.** Just another option, but I'm not sure if this will be more or less helpful than pursuing certifications.

Of course I'm still going to be applying for jobs, learning more helpful skills, and crossing my fingers on my own time (I'm also juggling trying to get my driver's license right now).

But I would appreciate any advice on what would be the best way to dedicate my overall time. I don't want to make the same mistakes again. My family is getting older, and I wish to be able to give back to them some day soon.

**TLDR;**

**I'm a recent graduate. I have a ""useless"" degree. I want to do some online schooling/training to better my prospects and break into HR. All of the schooling I'm considering will have to be** **ONLINE.** **There are various routes I'm thinking of taking. I don't know which option will be the most productive. Any advice would be much appreciated!**

(Additional Info - I managed to graduate debt free and I have quite a chunk of money in my savings. I'm not *too* worried about the cost of the online schooling because I know it'll be worth it. But if you have any affordable, *cost-effective* online-program recommendations, I would absolutely love to hear them. I am still trying to buy a car in the very near future after all, haha!)

Thanks in advance!"
Do employers actually verify education?,"I'm currently enrolled in a combined Bachelor of Science/ Master of Arts degree program. Because it's a combined degree, I won't actually receive any degree until I've finished the Master portion of the degree where I'll receive a BSMA, which means I don't technically have my bachelor's, even though I'm considered a graduate student and have all undergrad requirements met. 

I want to start working, so I've been applying to places saying I have my bachelor's degree and that I'm working on my master's. Obviously this could be perceived as morally gray at best. The alternative is that I list the BSMA on my resume with the expected graduation date, but I feel like this is confusing to employers and will also discredit me from any jobs that require a bachelor's (which is basically all of them I'm interested in)."
Conflicted about choosing a college major that would help me get a job,"So I'm a second year in college and i still dont know what to major in (dont judge me) because I really am terrified of choosing the wrong major and struggling to find a job in the future, especially abroad since I really want to live abroad. 

I considered so many majors such as communication, graphic design, psychology, and environmental science (I know my interests are varied). but I swear whenever I read about them, everything I hear is contradictory, someone would say that it has great job prospects, but then another person would say otherwise. 

Honestly, all the advice I see about choosing your major is always contradictory, some people say ""choose your passion"" and then another person would emphasize how that is a bad decision, some people say that all that matters is getting a ""hard"" skill like tech, and heck most of reddit would just say ""do STEM"" or whatever. 

Heck some people even say that your college major doesn't matter, while others say that it absolutely does.

How the heck do I figure out the truth?"
Will employers ask for my transcript?,"Hi guys, I'm just wondering whether they will ask for my transcript but due to covid we haven't held our graduation/commencement exercise but I already completed all my units/courses so basically I finished my study but there's no actual proof since they haven't issued our transcript."
Seeking advice on if I should pursue an associates degree rather than a bachelors degree,"I graduated with a bachelors degree in media studies in 2016.  Its been four years, and I've decided that I would like to pursue an education in computer programming.  I'm currently enrolled in an community college that has a transfer program to a university.

&#x200B;

My question- is it really worth taking out student loans to get the bachelors degree at a university, when I can get an associates degree for much cheaper?  I understand that generally a bachelors degree looks prettier to employers.  My existing bachelors degree is in an unrelated field to most jobs I'll be applying for, but its a bachelors degree nonetheless.  

&#x200B;

Would having an associates degree on top of my bachelors really set me back in the job pool, or do you internet strangers recommend I accrue some good old fashioned debt for my education?"
Do I have to go to a good school for finance?,"I don’t want to be in such a competitive job like investment banking and hedge fund, I would just like to have a career after having worked at entry level jobs for a while, 9 to 5, paying around 100k to 150k for a while and when I have so much experience, move up to a higher position. 

Has anyone gone to a regular university like U of H and has made a good living off of it? I plan to do other businesses and invest in real estate too. 

I’m just feeling a little let down since I’m only in the 22% at my high school. I have 2 years left."
Degree in Statistics or Computer Science/Information Technology?,"This is my last year in high school. That means my final exams, which are going to grant me the opportunity to become a university student, are a few days away. I'm confident I'll do well, but I have another problem. After evaluating my preferences and my strengths, my two options for a degree are Statistics and IT. However I haven't yet decided which one to follow. I have been involved with computers and relative technology for years, so I think this one would be more enjoyable for me. However, I have to taki into account job opportunities and future growth, because I won't be able to enjoy my job if I'm unemployed. You people obviously can't advise me on what I would love more, but I'm hoping you can give me some opinions such as which of the two would give me more opportunities, would make it easier to advance as a professional or anything else you think would be valuable. Thanks in advance."
Wanting to go to trade school but I'm in University,"Hey, so I'm currently in a business program in school, just finishing first year, and I enjoy it but I feel like my heart lies somewhere in the trades. I always loved doing things with my hands and such and I can see myself really enjoying being an electrician or plumber. 

My problem is my family wants me to complete my Bachelor's and I've already committed to it. Also people have told me my body will give out after some time.

Would it be wise to complete my business degree and then just go into the trades afterward? So I have a cushion for when I'm old and fragile lol. Keep in mind I am 19, and would be 22 once I graduate.

I know this might seem stupid but honestly I just want to know what people think. Thanks guys."
Is an International Business Degree any good for a career?,"I was planning on doing Business Administration at UCR with a finance concentration, but I was recently accepted into UCSD. They only offer IB or Economics, however economics is difficult to switch to. 

I am thinking about doing IB with a minor in finance UCSD. Will that still give me similar opportunities as BA? I’ll be doing my masters in business either way after a few years working. My goal was to become a financial advisor or analyst of some sort. 

There are other factors that are somewhat unrelated to the sub so I won’t include them."
APICS certification,"Anyone have APICS certification, and is it worth it? Which cert do you have?
I had begun looking for jobs back in Dec, and then stalled out while I decided if I wanted to pursue a certification. Then COVID came along. Now I'm back to looking for a new job, whether the time is right or not. I have a fair amount of supply chain experience, but it's specifically in the Agriculture industry. I've worked Ag for about 11 years now, but likely going to end up in another, less specific industry. Just trying to figure out again if I should get a cert and if it would help. I see plenty of jobs posted that say APICS is desired and I always mention in my cover letter that I would get it if needed.... thanks.
Reposting with different flair. Didn't get responses on first post."
"Employers, how does college education affect your decision to hire someone?","I hear people say college is a waste of money and won’t help with getting a job, then I hear you need a college education or else you won’t get one and I want to know, how does a college education affect your decision to hire someone? If you look for a college education, how do you feel about bachelors, masters, PhD, do those affect your decision too? Do you care if they went to a really prestigious college or a community college? What kind of jobs do you definitely need a college education for and what jobs do you don’t?"
Do Certifications Help with Getting a Job?,"I really wanted to go to college but never got a chance because I couldn't afford to. I recently visited Harvard's school website and they're offering free course but with around $49 you can get a certificate in so subject on this website ""edX"". I was curious if anyone has pursued these certificates or have gotten a job in result of one. Just so I can be sure these are worth paying for?"
Does my humanities MA give me any kind of edge in job hunting?,"Long story short, I wanted to be a German professor. For many reasons, both professional and personal, I decided to leave academia and master out of my program.

Now I have an MA in German Studies and I have my eyes on a couple fields: HR and/or logistics.  My question: does having an advanced degree give me any kind of edge in the job market?  Does anyone have any experience leveraging an MA into getting an entry-level job (especially a humanities degree)?  It doesn't have to be about getting into the two fields I mentioned, but after months of job hunting, I just want to hear other people's experiences and advice if only for the sake of knowing I'm not alone."
What should I major in?,"I'm young, and starting college soon. My dad is an executive for Samsung, and I want to have a job like him one day. Of course, I don't thrive for as high as he has achieved, but I want to work in technology. Though I'm confused, I know enough that a job at Sony, Microsoft, google, or one of those kinds of companies is what I can imagine. I envision myself dealing with the creative sides of things, stuff like designing interfaces, but also don't mind math and such. What should I aim to major in? Just looking for second opinions."
What career could be interesting for me?,"(I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language. Point them out anyway so I don't make then in future writings)

So I'm basically just before entering university and have no clue what I want to do...

I asked myself sometimes what I want to do for a living and well, the answer is always the same, nothing. 

I considered various careers; law, veterinary, economics, translation... But I just can't imagine doing any. All of them sound interesting but I just quickly lose interest in things. That's the reason for my regular grades too. I often find something we learn at school interesting, but after half an hour or less I lose interest, that line crossed, I start procrastinating and just can't focus.

Anyway, despite those impediments, there are some things I do like. I have a flair for language (not sure if I used the right idiom, I just learn languages pretty fast). I currently speak 3 languages fluently (English, Spanish, and German.) I understand some French but dropped it (May continue later) and I'd like to pick up 2 new ones (2 out of Japanese, Chinese, and Russian). I am furthermore studying a bit of Greek and Latin (In order to improve my general culture besides having a genuine interest in those cultures). Other than languages I am a bit curious about economics and entrepreneurship.

So I used to procrastinate the urge of finding a job I want to do for a living with the thought that I'd have no problem finding a job being polylingual, that thought got enhanced by some people in my environment. But as there are only 2 months left to decide what career to start I pushed myself to research a bit and write this post. 

Now straight to the point, does someone know a job I could like? or am I a hopeless case and should straight-up work on my mentality?

(if something remains unclear, just ask, I'd be glad to answer.)"
What job field is not over run,Ok so I've been lurking this sub for a while now and after job hunting as well I am questioning the Job Market for college grads. For people who study in environmental science that field of work appears hopeless with it being very difficult to find a entry level job in comparison to the medical field
"Can I do anything with an interdisciplinary associates degree in the ""Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences?","Anyone have any experience with similar interdisp degrees? I'm a Junior in High School and I'm going to be getting this degree in the fall as long as everything goes well.

Are multiple Associates degrees worth it? Or just redundant?,"I received an AAB in Management last July from a CC and then transferred to a university - this August I'll be done with my BS in Business Admin. 

I'm taking 3 (8-week) classes (the max) at the university to get done ASAP, and since I had only a few classes to go to get an AAB in Accounting for free at the CC, a couple of classes with them simultaneously. I work for a municipality and free unlimited online community college classes are a benefit of the union that I am a part of. However, it's only at one school with limited options. I had to pay out of pocket to finish my Bachelors, but what are you going to do. Also, before anyone gets too ahead of themselves and tells me to focus on my Bachelors's, I have a 4.0 with both schools - no issue with performance. I also plan on starting my MBA by the end of this year.

My question is: since the community college classes are completely free to me, is it worth it to put it a little bit of extra effort to attain the second AAB, but this time in Accounting? Also, with my current AAB in Management, I am only 2 classes short from another AAB in HR Management. Is that worth pursuing? I could be done with both additional AABs by October. 

My reasoning behind this is that I want to appeal to employers as much as possible and show that I'm not a one-trick pony, but in fact, pretty well rounded (with the degrees to prove it?). While I have 12 years of financial & hr business admin experience, I want to move up upon completion of my BS and ultimately be able to pay for the MBA as I go, instead of crippling myself with student loans. Also, I'm 32 years old and the plan is to continuously advance in my career."

What do CS/software employers look for when hiring university interns?,"I'm deciding between two Canadian universities for CS (McMaster and UofT). UofT is the better program thats much more prestigious but it is much more difficult and stressful. McMaster on the other hand has mixed reviews (but current students are happy), and is much easier relatively (thus I have more free time to work on my own CS projects.

My main question is:

When looking for internships as a student, do employers care about your university name/GPA more or your side projects and skills? Does an okay GPA (at a hard school) scare employers? Similarly, does a high GPA (at an easier school) help a ton?

All feedback, advice, and experiences are extremely appreciated! Feel free to add ANYTHING else you would feel is helpful! Thanks!"
Go for master degree abroad or Continuing my career?,"Hi guys,

I am facing a decision that can change what I will do long-term. I am 24 years old, working in the compliance (back-office) department of a major international bank in Hong Kong. I have been working there for 2 years after receiving my Finance/Statistics bachelor degree. The job's salary is really good as a uni graduate, but the job itself is boring and hasn't developed my skills and knowledge anymore, given limited and rather operational job scope of the team. The tasks that my seniors are doing are quite similar to my current tasks. In terms of international mobility within banking compliance, it is only possible in English-speaking countries where large financial institutions exist. Due to the prolonged political tension in Hong Kong, the development of the city is grim and the financial industry is shrinking. I don't feel that my job is safe and I am feeling empty after working in the field for 2 years.

Meanwhile, since a year ago I have been thinking about studying a master degree in Germany, which could improve my profile. I have been interested in studying and living in Germany since a long time ago and visited the country for a few times, the longest being 2 months in Berlin studying German. Recently I have reached B2 (upper-intermediate) level in the language, so it wouldn't take a long time to be fluent in it. Recently I have received an offer from the Technical University of Munich - Master in Management and Technology starting Winter 2020 (2-year program, at least), and wonder if I should take the offer and study again from November this year. In long-term I hope to stay in Germany and work there, hopefully in Tech-related area, maybe Fintech. As most of the students graduate at the age of 25-27 in Germany with a master degree, I hope it will be fine by the time I graduate.

My question is whether I should make this move, given that the current corona crisis and I am not sure if I can stay in the country for longer term. Hope to have your advice on what I should consider before I make my decision."
"Do any of you regret your major? where are you now? (majored in finance (class of 2020), thinking of going back to school right away)","Hmm well yeah I majored in finance and I even did a high finance internship and it was very tedious and boring. While the money was good, there was no freedom working in that kind of environment, and it felt like my life had no meaning. It was really quite sad. Im not 2 weeks away from graduating and I thought I had a job lined up but theres been a hiring freeze, so now im toying with the idea of getting another degree with better work/life balance, and more prospects?

Im thinking of doing an accelerated program in either nursing or computer science. Nursing has jobs outside of the city and you can work flexible hours from what I know which is cool, compensation also isnt bad. Comp sci would likely augment my finance degree well and give me some cool options. 

Im 22 if that matters and Canadian"
Sales and School,"I’ve never really posted on Reddit. But after googling around I don’t know where else to turn. I’m just going to throw it all out there and hope you all pick up what I’m saying.

I graduated with a BAchelors Business Admin management emphasis.
While I was doing my degree I was working in business development. Basically I called people and scheduled appointments for sales people and got commission. 
I started selling cars after I finished my degree. 
I have always liked being in the dealership because it is fast paced, and a young guy like me can hit the ground and first year wind up close to 6 figures.
I love learning, and there’s only so much to learn selling cars alone.
A small part of me wants to go back for a masters but I really don’t know what I would do with it. I love selling, the hustle, the lack of time, setting and crushing goals. I love not just talking to people but influencing people’s decisions.
However, I like the bigger data, and one day I want to manage people. I realize I do like analytics, if decisions can change the outcome, and lead to success. I have looked into what I could do next, and a big part of me wants to go back for an MBA. My issue is then I’m back to entry level. I would like to go into a job I could start hustling at right away. What would that look like? Does such a job exist? I love my current job, and where I’m at. Just don’t want to look back and say I should have done “X”."
what jobs can you get with cs + cog science?,"aside from software development, can you go into any specific cs fields with just a cs + cog sci undergraduate degree?"
Future career path for someone who has interests in non marketable fields,"Say you like philosophy or literature or art, how do you choose what to do in life, to make people give you their money you gotta have something to offer, so if you are an software engineer or a surgeon or a chemist there are fields where companies that work and make money need your service and are willing to pay money for it, or you can create something new to offer people and make your own business, or you can research in that field and contribute to its future, but that last part is less retributive.

Now if you're a person like I said in the beginning what do you do?
You can write or paint, that's what you're passionate about and you're happy doing that, but you also want money, you have to get creative about it, find a way, it's harder, so if you use your mind you can come up with something I think, alot of people don't bc its easier to just get a job and be passive, but I also think that you cant only rely on that, doing one of those things at university it's a death sentence for your job, you can teach but that's it, if you do something it's most probably not related to your degree bc it's not a marketable skill (unless you become like an art museum manager but that's rare and cant rely on that either).

So what do you do, the options I see are those:

-you study it anyway, you got an almost useless degree and worked a shitty unqualified job part time 3 to 5 years so you dont even have a kind of career in a field or much money, and ur in a place like the USA u also got debt. You dont make much money and its probs a dead end job so unless something special happens you're stuck.

-you dont study at uni but by yourself and start a job right away, probably a bad one bc u dont have any skills right out of ""high school"" (the name you call it actually depends on your country) and ur 17/18/19 (also depends on country). You dont make much money and its probs a dead end job so unless something special happens you're stuck.

-You get a degree in something you don't like but makes money, and then work a job in that field so you don't like it either, if you make alot maybe you'll FIRE at some point, but it's mortifying to walk that path.



So how do you go about it?
It's like you're handicapped in the job world.
Career and money it's not all that there is in life but if ur poor most likely your life sucks so.


What do you think about it?"
"Currently a content writer wanting to advance by position, should I get a diploma on digital marketing or web development?","Hi, 23F here. Right now I'm working as a content writer on paper but really, my company makes me do copywriting (ad copies and landing pages) and basically all forms of writing (from web pages to video content etc).

I feel stuck as is and I dont think I'll go very far as *just* a writer. I want to be able to be a manager of sorts and be more involved in marketing (I already kinda handle our company social media and do basic edits on WordPress).

My plan is to enroll in a 1 yr diploma program abroad (half for skills advancement and half to get out of my country) and rn I can't decide if I should get a diploma in web development or digital marketing. I'm kind of really interested in web dev because I find fixing the minor changes in the website a bit fun. My coding knowledge is pretty basic (like HTML stuff from HS) so maybe my opinion is biased. But I feel like if I pick web development, I'd get stuck at some point cus I dont have marketing knowledge. So I'm considering just going straight to learning digital marketing so I have more useful skills in advancing myself in the future.

My background is just a bachelor's degree on International Studies and 2-3 ish years working as a content writer/copywriter but both companies I've worked it involved me handling their social media and website too.

What do you guys think is the best choice to study: Web Dev or Digital Marketing? Or are there other diploma courses I should consider that can help me advance?"
Stay at my solid job or go back to school?,"Graduated from undergrad this past December and I got a job in February. It isn’t my ideal job but there is no stress and I genuinely like who I work with. It pays decent I guess for a first job and has good benefits. 

Shortly after starting work, I wanted to at least apply for grad school since this upcoming school year will be the most convenient time to go back. I applied and I got in, while being offered a Graduate Assistant position. This means I will not go into any debt.

The question is which choice do I make? Do I stay at this steady job? Or go back to school and take my chances elsewhere?"
Certifiably Good Online Coding Classes?,"I’m a university student graduating undergrad in a couple weeks and going straight into a masters program in the fall. My summer plans have fallen through, and I doubt I will find new ones. Are there any online coding classes you all would recommend? As per other advice on this page, I am hoping to build up skills for future job-search post MPH. I found a lot of online sources, but I’m not sure what is accredited or what a recruiter/potential employer will view as legitimate. Looking for low-cost options that are more flexible than taking a class at my university, as I will need to get some type of temporary job or gig to keep myself afloat for a while."
18 year old - deciding a major in the U.K.,"
This whole time I've been focusing on business management/marketing as a field in university and I keep hearing things on reddit about how it is too broad. I think one of the main reasons I leaned towards this was because personally, I love talking to people, not necessarily socialising but persuading, negotiating, advertising things (in real life). I seriously think I'd be more passionate being a door to door salesmen instead of a person who sits behind his computer all day. I say this because, from the ages 10-16, I always sat in front of my computer for multiple hours a day after school, I played games, edited videos, all that. I loved it, but then after that, due to an environmental change, it forced me to be more extroverted outside of school time, it made me want to focus on becoming the best version of myself, I started lifting, properly talking, I gained confidence and stopped feeling sluggish. I know that...because during this lockdown, I've felt more sluggish than ever in the past 2 years and now I know why.

So anyway, I researched a bunch of fields and their experience, though I did not do well in school with Maths, I see that Computer Science is a highly demanded major especially for making money, though it does not appeal to me I could be willing to put in the work, as I got quite disappointed after searching up any business related degree and seeing it get bashed and people regretting doing it.

If anyone has any opinions, tips and advice for if they were in my position feel free to let me know!"
"Got my first real developer job offer that is ""contingent on my earning of a bachelors in May 2020"", but I technically will be one credit off from graduation due to COVID..?","I managed to get a full-time job offer the week of graduation at a small company (Midwest). It's for an Application Developer role and I'm finishing my Computer Science degree in a few days now and the offer is more than generous. I'm filling out the agreement forms and whatnot, but something that caught my eye was that the offer is ""contingent on that I earn a bachelors in May of 2020"". The thing is, due to COVID shutdowns, I am missing one science course. (I was at the max credit load this semester. My plan was to study for and pass what is called a CLEP exam for college credit, which would give me the science course I need. See [r/CLEP](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLEP/) for details.)

Well, every place in the country I can take the exam is closed, so I'm kinda just 'Unofficially graduated' until the country opens up. So, **I technically haven't earned my degree in May, 2020.** Is this something that would middle-finger me and get my offer revoked? Wondering if I can just sorta go along and hope it doesn't matter, and get the exam done ASAP when I can."
What certificates actually lead to jobs?,"There is a technical school in my area. They have several programs of study but I’m not sure which certificates actually will help someone get a job and not be an add on to a degree. I’m not interested in going for a Bachelors. I don’t want to take on the loans nor am I certain what I would even want to go back to school for. I wouldn’t mind going the trade/certificate route, I’m just not sure where to begin. 

I currently work in the retail side of a pharmacy as a shift leader. I’ve been there almost 3 years. I can work in the pharmacy when needed but it’s definitely not something I enjoy. I’d rather be on the retail side. Before that I was an Operations Manager at a crafts store and an Assistant Manager at a gas station."
I don't know what to use my education aid for?," All I care about is a job with historically low unemployment and a large number of people employed. I have the option to use my aid for an Associates in art or science or aa/s for transfer, or a certificate. I think an AA/S-T is the best because then I would get the degree and could get to work right away and have the option to go for a bachelor's. I am using BLS data to make decisions. I am not following a passion, I just kind of chill. I have a criminal record of misdemeanors that are getting expunged hopefully when the courts open, and I have been committed to, so I can not look for a job that needs a gun.

Is being a teacher as good of a job as I think it is?,"I have been a nanny since I got my Bachelor's in Psychology 2 years ago. I make $17 an hour. I know teachers aren't paid what they should be, but the salary & benefits are a heck of a lot better than what I have now. Also, an average of 13 more weeks off per year than the average American worker... sounds pretty great to me. Thoughts?"
Is university really that important?,"All i hear is ""go to university so that you can get a good job or won't amount to nothing"", kind of.

But is it really true?

I dont want to spend other 5 years in a scholastic system, I hated ""high school"" (in my country there's not high school but another name), I want to be a real estate agent and build wealth with it, and then invest my money.

There are things I'm interested in learning like history philosophy or computer science but I prefer studying them by myself instead of spending 5 years at university with no income and being dependent on my parents, i want to live alone.

So, if you have already experienced this, is uni really that critical?

 I'm facing a tough decision and would really appreciate some advice. So I'm from a small eastern European country, living standards aren't that great and there aren't many options for master's either. I graduated from university last year and got a good job in my field of work. I really like my job, but was thinking of getting my master's to have a better chance of getting a higher paying job. In my opinion, my language skills and academic background allows me to study abroad and then return home. At the same time, i'm not stressed at this job at all and it allows me to gain some valuable experience. This question feels more like education vs experience. So what do you think guys? should I continue working and get to higher positions by adding experience to my resume or get my master's abroad, which will also be valuable in the  recruiters' eyes.

Edit: Should have mentioned, I majored in International Relations."

Can you get a good job without college,"I know that college is the go-to thing when you want a good job but I've also heard of how you drown in the college tuitions.

Help with choosing career path,Im going into my last year of high-school next semester and I have no idea where to go after. All the classes I have taken were taken because i enjoyed them and I don’t see how they come together to help me specialize post secondary’s. What should I do?
What jobs can I get if I study marketing?? Art related??,"
Hi everybody. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about my future. I’m 18F and I’ve just finished my first year at college studying business. 

The thing is, I really like art and design, and I want to do something related to it. However, I didn’t have enough confidence to enter an art or design program out of fear that I wouldn’t be able to get my foot in the door and kickstart a career out of it. The art industry is very competitive, and I felt like I couldn’t market myself or understand the business side without studying business. 

I don’t mind business; I find some parts, such as stocks, accounting, some management concepts interesting. But I don’t want to just do business my whole life.. I kind of don’t even know what it is exactly, since the field is so broad! I’m specializing in marketing since I heard that you can do advertising or maybe even design. I just want to do something with a mix of art and business. However, I don’t know what jobs are actually available that mesh those two together

I guess my general questions are: 
1. What kind of jobs are popular in the marketing industry?

2. Is it easy to find jobs that mix art and business? What are some tips for in school and when you graduate that will help??

3. If not, should I switch programs? I was thinking it was also possible to land an art related business job by working w a company long enough so that you could shift roles within the company.

Thanks."

Are entry level professional certificates worth it if I'm not working in that field?,"My long term career goal is to work in records management. Most jobs I've seen require a higher education or experience level than I have. ARMA, one of the relevant professional groups, has an [entry level certificate program](https://www.arma.org/page/EssentialsOfRIM?), but it sounds like it's more for people who already have a job managing records.

Is it bad to just get an Associates Degree?," Hello,

I am 18 and currently attend a community college and only plan to do the needed two years to earn my Associates Degree, and not transfer to do a Bachelor's.

Is it bad to just have an Associates Degree? Can I still get into good paying jobs with two years? How much does GPA really matter with a 2 year degree?

My reasoning:

Firstly, I have extremely severe issues focusing on studies (will be getting diagnosed by a doctor in the next few weeks, I believe I have very strong ADD) This is the majority of the reason why I do not want to do two more years.

I am ***not*** saying the following to ""flex"" (so please do NOT say that in the comments thank you!!), but to give more context upon my situation.

I am not in a desperate need for money, I am fortunate enough to own two vehicles and soon my own place to live all which my parents have graciously provided me (I am very fortunate I know). They cover a majority of the needed costs + I have a delivery driving job that I make decent pay from. Possibly after a year or two of being moved in I plan to get a roommate to pay me rent so that will be an extra source of income.

Of course I want to be successful on my own, this is my reason for attending college in the first place. I try my very hardest, but end up with a C average.

Planning to go into business or marketing or IT. My goal is to eventually start up my own car customization shop.

Thank You for reading, Again please no trashtalking me for having all this stuff given to me. I already deal with that criticism IRL and do not need it here. I never have begged my parents for anything, there goals are simply to give there son an easier life, since most of their life was very rough."

Should I quit my retail job?,"I'm 18, second semester college student working at a grocery store. 

I originally started working there 8 months ago to pay for school.   
It's a comfy job, union, can't be fired on the spot, and have accommodated my available hours quite well. Last semester I worked \~20 hours a week, this semester only \~10, weekends only.

Lately I have been getting more overwhelmed with assignments with no time to really just relax and dread going to work because of it. 

I will hopefully have a paid internship in the fall so I definitely will be quitting then, I also was considering quitting before my next semester as I definitely won't have time. 

I don't hate my job, or anything, I just feel as if it is causing me more stress then I can handle sometimes.

(Canada) How important are educational institutions when it comes to getting a job?,"Hey, so I'm planning on moving to Canada this year and I want to break into the international trade industry.

I'm considering studying at a Canadian institution like BCIT in order to have better access to the local labor market (making contacts, BCIT job board, etc ). 

I would like to know if paying the price of a certificate (some 7500 CAD) from an institution like that is worth it from a job search standpoint, or if I'm just better off looking for a job in the traditional way (applying directly to companies, Zip recruiter, Linkedin, etc).

For example, here in Mexico, having access to the job boards and contacts (both faculty and students) of elite universities is a game changer when it comes to gettting a high paying job, while public job boards are basically useless and have awful job offers.

On the other hand, in Spain (where I went to university) I found university job boards to be a waste of time with usually poor job postings, and few contacts to be made (most of faculty are bureaucrats without private sector experience). In Spain you're better off applying directly to companies or using public job boards.

What I want to know is if Canada is more like Mexico in this regard, or like Spain.

For anyone who studied at a Canadian institution, what ahs been your experience with this?"

I’m considering becoming a Medical Coding Specialist and need advice about schooling and the job itself,"So, I’m 29 and make less than 20k per year. This is due to a lot of things; my own anxiety scaring me away from schooling, and me not fighting that anxiety being the real culprits.

Anyway, I’m throwing that out the window and calling my local technical college tomorrow. I’ve been thinking about going in to medical coding for years. Some reasons why:

-I have social anxiety and am a bit of an introvert, and this job seems like a decent fit for that

-I enjoy using computers in general; just the sound of a keyboard relaxes me a lot

-I need schooling that’s around a year or less (a little more than that is ok too)

-I need to make at least 25k-30k per year within the next 2 years, full time hours are fine for me; this career seems to make that possible

-Seems to avoid weekends, which is important for my circumstances

-I really want a job where when I go home, I don’t take it home with me. I want to do my job, then not think about it

From what I have seen, this career seems to check all those boxes, right?

If so, I really want to look into starting classes. Thing is, for 1 year of schooling, my local technical college estimates around $5000-$5500, and that’s not including books. Does that seem right? For some reason I thought I heard it would be cheaper, but maybe that’s just for 3-4 month certification?

Finally, if $5000-$5500 is accurate, I’m debating how to go about paying for it. I have a decently large chunk of money from a windfall, about $30k, but I’m worrying if I should really use $5k of that on this course. I worry that once I spend it, it obviously won’t come back, so what if this course is the completely wrong decision for me and now all I did was throw away $5k?

Haha, I think I’m a bit of a mess. I really wasted away my 20s and I’m just trying to pick up the pieces. Anyway, any help will be appreciated on schooling, or the career itself. I’m open to alternative options that fit all or most of those things I listed above that I’m looking for."

Useful things to learn for those in the sciences?,"So I'm using all the free time I have from covid-19 to learn some new skills to improve my resume and make me a better candidate. I'm unsure if my old work will survive after lockdown eases up or ends (I'm in the SF Bay Area) so that's a factor too. 

Some background info: I graduated in 2019 with a BS in chemistry and am looking for lab tech positions. My old job was at R&D for a cosmetics company and I didn't use as much of my degree as I would've liked while I was there. I still have all my notes I took for my chem classes so I should be able to study up on that when/if I get rusty.

Right now, I'm learning some more complex stuff with Excel and I know Python is a good thing to learn too. Is there anything else that would make me a stronger candidate for jobs involving the sciences, more specifically chemistry?"
"Is a Bachelor of Arts (Major in Political Science or Economics) enough for a job in Marketing, should I be aiming for a Bachelor of Commerce instead? (Going to get an MBA either way)","Hi everyone, I'm a senior in high school and is in the process of applying to colleges. My dream job is to work for Disney or Apple in their marketing department and I wanted to set myself up for that. My college admissions have been ok so far and I've gotten into a couple of BA programs for Political Science or Economics but my parents are pushing me to do a BCOM. Since I'm going to do an MBA after college, does it really matter in the future what my undergrad degree is? Thank you!"

I’m wondering if i should spend my time maintaining a high gpa or networking by creating close relationships with many people. I can’t do both.

Learning the mortgage industry,"I just started a new job 2 weeks ago at a bank working the lock desk for mortgages. This is 110% brand new territory for me. I know nothing about mortgages: how they work on the borrowers side and how they work on the investor/lender side (slowly, slowly learning). How can I supplement work information with learning the ins and outs of the mortgage industry?"
"I Want to be a Wildlife Biologist Someday, But I'm still Indesicive because of my lack of Knowledge In this Track. Help Me Please..."," 

Hi, I'm an incoming Grade 10 Student. We might take our NCAE Test in the upcoming months. I was still indecisive about the career that I want to pursue. I know there are still years left before college, but I was very curious about the path that I want to take. I have lots of questions.

\*What are the jobs that are embodied in studying Animal Biology, Wildlife Studies, and Environment Studies?

\*How can I ensure that I can get a stable job when I graduate? Should I get a master's degree after I graduate? or I should serve for government jobs to repay for my scholarship (like DOST).

\*What course should I take if I want to pursue to be a Wildlife Biologist or Animal Rehabilitator? Should I take BS Bio or BS Forestry? or should I take other courses?

\*What school really does focuses on these aspects? Should I take a famous and well-known school?

\*How many years can it take to have a stable career? What is the estimated income of these jobs?

\*They said that if I study this track, I might end up being a teacher because my ideal career is not having a major impact on our country. Am I really going to be a teacher?

\*Lastly, should I take other courses first and find a temporary job to earn money to study these courses?

I'm really sorry for asking clown questions, It might seem laughable but I only have a little information about this track that I want. Please notice my message and help me clarify these things. Thank you so much for your valuable time!"
Graduate Certificate? or Associates? (Post-Bachelors),"So I graduated from a below-average state university on the west coast of the USA last May 2019. I graduated with a finance degree and a 3.59 GPA. I only had one unrelated internship during a summer years ago in the engineering field. I took some time off for the summer and fall to travel with family and learn some new coding languages like SQL. I started my job hunt on new year's day this year and as I expected, the search has been brutal. Over 50 applications sent out to analyst and accountant jobs in my city and only one interview for a credit analyst at a regional bank has crossed paths with so far. I'm in the final running for 3 positions on that one but I'm not going to hold my breathe until I get an offer letter. I'm already regretting not doing a double major and I'm already thinking deeply about going back to school.

All the advisors at my alma mater are pushing me towards MBA and other Master's programs but I feel that's all just a sales pitch for more of my money. I really rather not get a full fledged masters degree without any work experience as I would just dig myself deeper into the over-qualified hole. I just want to dive into more accounting or something data related in MIS or Information Management to broaden my skills. I have three options laid out in front of me and I was wondering if any redditors can help a fella make a more informed decision:

1. A graduate certificate at my university in MIS (4 grad-level courses about Big Data)
2. An associates in accounting at the local community college (only 5 courses past basic accounting)
3. An associates in software/database technology at the same community college (11 courses involving oracle, SQL, java & other programming)

\#1 is the only step above my bachelors. #2 is the fastest and cheapest option. #3 would give me the biggest boost in technical skills. These are all my cost effective options and I guess **my main question** up for debate is **which is more valuable after completing a bachelors? A graduate certificate? or an associates degree?**"
Question about a degree - Communications/Marketing,"I'm an upcoming high school graduate with college decisions on my way. I'm considering a ton of options for majors (and I know undecided is an option, but still constantly thinking).
I've always enjoyed communications and marketing, but family members feel that there aren't any jobs nor is there promise in the market for those majors. Both mention the struggles of those majors when they were in college.
So, is there actual promise in the market for these? Are there actually any jobs or would you be getting pennies?"
"Those in the Health Informatics field, is the school where you get your masters important?","Planning to go back to get an MS in HI (unrelated background) and I’m looking into some programs and I’m leaning towards the programs in Chicago as they’re nearby and in the city so I’m hoping it would be a bit easier to find an intern or part time job. I’m also coming from an unrelated background (Environmental Science) so some are more lenient when it comes to prerequisites. So, back to the question, is the school where you get your masters important if you get work, and possibly research, experience? 

Thanks!"
I wanna try welding.,I’m 16 and have a chance to start welding in a junior college. I’m just wandering should I? Do you think that the experience would look gods on a resume. I think the school is like vocational so i don’t know. I think i would wanna go with PG&E. Just wandering if that’s the right move.
What are the job paths for applied math?,"I'm a senior in highschool and I'm considering majoring in applied math and adding a physics or CS minor. I know applied math is more focused on workforce/industry while pure math is more focused on going into academia. I'm just struggling to find people who majored in applied math and now have a job. All the places I've asked seem to be filled with students rather than adults so that's probably why I'm struggling to find examples. I just want to know the path of people and what it takes (do I need a masters, phd, minor, etc)."
Jobs checking education requirements,"So I know it's not the right thing to do, but I fudged on my resume and said I had a bachelors degree. I do have a lot of education, about as many credits as a bachelors degree requires, just didn't get all the right ones. 

I've been offered the job. The job I have currently barely pays me enough to live off of, the new one pays significantly more. I lied because I knew I had plenty of experience, but companies weren't taking me seriously without the degree because I work in accounting. 

During the interview they seemed more interested in my work experience than education anyways. They ended up offering me more money then they advertised and said they were impressed with me. I'm already signed up for on-boarding, have signed my offer letter, and just filled out the Background check consent form.

I filled out the back ground check consent form and it states they will check: criminal, drug & dmv checks, and of course states that it may include other things, but I'm thinking since they didn't state it explicitly like the other things, it's not likely. 

The job does not legally require a degree, and the website stated that you could also have equivalent experience, which I have.

It's a large company. I read online that only 34% of companies verify education. Has anyone had experience with this? If it works my plan is to continue my education, get the degree, and since that'll take years, probably apply to a new job with the actual degree."
Whats the best way to get business schooling when I have a bachelor's degree in a diffetent field?,"To make a long story short, I graduated with a degree in English teaching, but decided to have a different career. 

I have a job now that pays much more than teaching, with growth opportunities, a fun environment, and that doesn't require work being brought home with me so I can focus on my husband and future family. Not only that, but I am really good at it.

The position I have is a mix between sales and customer support. My main objective is getting users registered to our product, and building relationships with them, so we can help them buy and sell their assets using our portal. I am crazy good at it, and want to stay with the company for the foreseeable future.

However, I still would like some sort of schooling to help me out. I would love to take some marketing classes and maybe even get my MBA. Is there a better, cheaper option though?"
I want a different BA degree,I have a BA in Public Relations with a minor in Communications. It has not gotten me where I want to go in my career life. I want to look into HR or Social Services.

Should I get an associates in business administration for an executive assistant job?,"Hello, I wasn’t really sure where to post this. I just hope someone can give me a word of advice. I am finishing my first year of college now. I switched from bachelors in accounting to business administration. I wanted to switch to online classes since I really dislike living on campus and honestly I’m not really enjoying college in general. While researching online programs I also came across programs for an associates degree in business administration. I have a few career choices in mind such as an executive/administrative assistant or a bank worker. 

Really what I’m wondering is, is an associates degree going to be a worthwhile idea for me? My biggest concern is saving money and getting into the work force quicker. Also, I don’t plan on making millions of dollar. I know I won’t make as much with an associates degree, but would it be enough to get by and guarantee I’d get a job?"
What Certifications May I Benefit a From? (Pricing Analyst),"I am a pricing analyst with an ongoing year of experience, straight out of college. I hold a Bachelor’s of Business Administration in disciplines of finance and business management.

I use Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, Outlook, Access) on a regular basis, with intermediate skills in Excel (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, etc.). Using data sets on Excel & assumptions, perform pricing/profitability analysis to support other departments for new and existing business opportunities. I also provide quantitative analyses pertaining to sales data to back my claims in decision making. I have no experience with Visual Basic, and no coding experience (I only utilized access to obtain information, with some experience managing backend data). 

My career goals are currently flexible. I like the idea of perfecting my craft and moving up within the corporate ladder. I am also open to pursuing other opportunities if value is offered for financial, personal and professional growth. I am open to pursuing a senior pricing analysis role in the relevant future, while also open to doing something more influential/managerial in the future.

What are some certifications or skills I may benefit from?"
Can I get a job in banking with just a minor in finance?,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this or if this is a stupid question.

I'm currently a high school senior that is completely confused as to where she even wants to attend college. I recently got a likely letter and invitation to Duke so they've really been on my mind. I was wanting to do political science and minor in finance. Then eventually get an MBA. I was wondering if this would be enough to get a job in the finance/banking field. I was also wondering if this route is practical enough to allow me to become a CPA. Again, I'm sorry if this is the wrong place. Thank you for you help.


Note: Duke does not have a business school/major and I would much rather prefer to not major in econ."

In college trying to choose a career path.,"I was going to switch to psychology, but I think I’m going to stick it out with my major. I’m majoring in media and information with a focus on media management/human centered technology. Not a fan of the classes. Careers that interest me are experimental psychologist/research, psych teacher, and school psychologist (though I need a masters for those). 

I’m in my 3rd year so a BS in psych degree would cost me an extra semester, and I heard it’s pretty much useless. My plan was to finish this degree and get a masters in psychology, but I feel like I’d be wasting the opportunity to get research experience prior to getting my masters. Another option is to just double major, see which one I like better, and do or don’t pursue my masters from there."
Is getting a masters in Health Informatics from a program without CAHIIM accreditation worth it career wise?,"I’m coming from a background that’s unrelated to this field and currently trying to find a program that I’ll be able to get in. Since I’m from the Midwest, I’ve been primarily looking around here, but I’m open to recommendations. So far I’ve been looking into UIC (downside that it’s all online, but it is accredited), DePaul (in person, but not accredited), SIUE (downside smaller city, in the process of getting accredited, but not sure what that really means to me), and then SLU (in person, not accredited).

So far, I’ve been attracted to the DePaul program as I believe I’ll be able to do better since it’s in person.  I’m not sure how it’ll impact me when I look for position after I complete the degree.

Basically my question: Is it worth even going to a school that isn’t accredited? Would it be difficult/near impossible for me to find a position? 

Thanks!"

Career choice: Engineering/Architecture OR Physician,"Career choice: Engineering/Architecture OR Physician


Hi,

as the title suggests, I'm torn between these two fields. I'm set on beginning studying this fall, and don't know which one to choose. Below are pros and cons that I see. What do you think about this? 

**Engineering/Architecture:**

This programme is a double degree, in both Engineering and Architecture. 

Pros:

* I enjoy the creative and aesthetic aspect. I am almost certain I would be a good architect. 

* I have some sort of business vision

* I enjoy maths

* I enjoy building (construction)

Cons: 

* Worried I won't feel like I'm helping humanity/individuals; that I would lack meaning. 

* I worry that I might be mislead by the apparent praise/value/prestige a double degree is given, while I only value the engineering degree (apart from my appreciation for maths) as far as a merit to retreive higher positions and pay in future jobs. Solely a degree in architecture, I reason, would not be enough to speedily propel me toward my end goal (having my own business, being self-employed). 

* no higher purpose, other than the fact that I enjoy the ideation of living spaces. 




**Physician:**

Pros:

* Actually helping individuals on a daily basis; altruism; reducing the amount of suffering in the world.

* Opportunities for research, which could have a significant impact, and would probably feel meaningful.

* Working with people, as opposed to sitting behind a computer designing houses for the middle/-upper class. 

Cons:

* Lacks the creative aspect. (Might be wrong?)

* I haven't ever really been interested in neither chemistry nor biology in school. However, one's interests change through life. It is common that what once has been deemed uninteresting, later in life is discovered to be very interesting. My stated disinterest in chemistry and biology is not to be taken as completely true, as I'm not too familiar with the subjects, other than from high school, really. 

* (Difficult education. However, I am from Sweden so it's not as bad as in the US, same goes for working conditions)


Basically it is, as I see it, personal enjoyment with a struggle to find meaning VS. meaning with a struggle to find personal enjoyment. Which is preferable? Am I missing something? Any help/input would be highly appreciated. Thank you :)"
Debating on going back to school for a MS in Information Systems - does school necessarily matter?,"I’m coming from an unrelated science background and in that field it didn’t really matter as long as you got some sort of experience under your belt. But, I’m just a bit worried about how it’ll look if I go to a program that isn’t well known/ranked for the Information Systems program. I was hoping to get an internship, then an entry level position and move my way up from there. Would the name of the university I go to really hinder me?

Thanks!"
Computer Science Degree vs Self taught,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this.

Is doing a Computer Science Degree really worth doing nowadays? my dad and I have been talking about enrolling in a computer science degree or a pathway to get into uni in June, as I may not have a high up marks to get into uni and I'm having second thoughts about all this as there would be a lot of boring crap like calculus and assignments and the list goes on that I don't know crap about. he also told me it be a waste of 10 grand going to college and just to get my marks up to get into uni he does really wanna do that. What do you actually learn in a Computer Science degree? so far I have self-teach myself  javascript/python/C#/C++ and few frameworks like jquery and react. on other hand, I seen job advertises who don't even ask for a degrees anymore. should I just keep self-teaching my self and skip Uni and build up my portfolio?"
What online certification could I obtain to secure a job?,"I work a dead end desk job in Ontario, Canada. I'm looking at different online courses that could land me a high demand job. I like tech and business. I was perhaps thinking of getting an AutoCad certification, coding or Data Analytics. But I don't want to commit to studying something that will not get me a better job than my current one. Thereby, resuming the dreadful job search. Do you guys have any programs or courses in mind?

TIA!"
Want to go back to uni and do a Masters to open up the possibility of a research assistant or scholar of some sort. Haven't got much support from my family.,"I graduated several years ago with a liberal arts (English and History) BA degree and have struggled to find full-time work since then. I think I need to upskill and most recently I did a TEFL before realising that I needed a CELTA or TESOL to teach IN this country. To be a teaching assistant I need CACHE.

When I was younger I hoped to follow a standard BA-> MA and maybe PhD route, but since I was ill during and after my undergraduate studies I lost my confidence in being able to do more than BA. 

I've seen some interesting research assistant roles but they pretty much all require a Masters (MRes in particular). I went on open days for the unis to learn more about the MA programs and was quite interested. I brought them up with my parents afterwards and my mum in particular wasn't really interested while Dad was ambivalent. Mum practically handled my Student Finance claims when I was an undergraduate since I wasn't very well throughout my studies (e.g. I gave her permission to speak with the call centre on my behalf); despite this I got a scholarship/bursary two years in a row and avoided accommodation by staying at home (a decision I partially regret but it's done) so paid off most of my debt back then. Of course now it doesn't matter since my friends who were once saddled in debt now have MAs, some PhD and have established a career path.  

There is one route which they back, that's me completing a PGCE to obtain Qualified Teacher Status so I can be a state school teacher. Everything else is just ""but the debt Xemnas"" and I...frankly don't have a very strong sense of self to oppose them. If they treat me as if I can't handle the loan then, maybe I can't :/   

I'd be less pissed about this if they didn't let my brother see his own degree to the end (PhD). My sister also just completed her nursing degree; granted she's now paying off debt working crazy hours in the hospital. I understand that they are trying to stop me getting into debt, it's not malicious, but I get the feeling my BA isn't got enough, I need SOMETHING more to get off the ground so...I don't really have much choice."
Almost finished with high school but don't have diploma yet. Should I go ahead and apply for a job?,I want to start working at the hospital in a tech position. It it a starting position and you work while you get certified. Problem is that the job listing requires a high school diploma but I don't have mine yet technically. I'm about to finish up with my final class and just have a senior project to do before I am finished which would take 3 weeks at best. Should I just go ahead and apply or wait until I'm done?  Thanks.
So I plan on getting a BS in Biotechnology and MSc in Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology,"So, as the title states, I want to study Biotechnology as an undergrad and Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology in grad school. I am currently working on my AA degree right now, but have no concrete idea on my job opportunities after getting each of these degrees. I know I may be jumping the gun, but I am just curious on how useful these degrees will be. That being said, I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask you guys a few questions.

1. I heard it's hard to get a job with a Biotechnology degree, especially if you don't live in the right place. I live in Florida, how good are my chances of landing a job and how much should I expect to make?
2. With a BS in Biotech, what type of jobs would I have available to me? (Research, academia, etc.)
3. Considering I don't change my mind later on, what value would a Master's in Animal Molecular and Cellular Biology have when it comes to me getting a job? Would it be at all useful compared to other grad degrees I could go for? (Bioengineering, bioinformatics, etc.)
4. Would I be limiting myself with this potential Masters since it is ***Animal*** Molecular and Cellular Biology or am I just overthinking it?
5. After getting these degrees, would job hunting be a lot easier for me or would it be just as much a struggle as with other bio-degrees?
6. What can I do to help better my chances of getting a job whenever I get either of these degrees?

I don't plan on getting a PhD because I feel like that's not for me, so I'm hoping I can still be successful with these two degrees if I like them as much as I think I will and pursue them. Any advice or answers will be greatly appreciated."
Looking to change career with a Master’s,"I have a Bachelor’s degree with a concentration in graphic design and photography and... it’s not for me.  

At first I was trying to break into marketing, but my work didn’t help me much and I wasn’t able to get an interview for a marketing job that did not seem scammy.

I’d like to change my career.Is there a master’s degree that I can get with my bachelor’s background that is not graphic design or heavily art related? I am struggling with my research."
Technical school degree/ certificate question on an application.,"I'm applying for a government job and on the application it asked education level. During high school i took a 3 year class at a technical/ vocational school. It was paid for by my high school while still taking my normal high school classes.

 I graduated and received a diploma/ certificate from my tech school. Along with another certificate from the state saying i graduated in my field. 

Does that count as a technical school degree/ certificate? My mom says it doesn't sense i was still in high school and compared it to a college degree. A work colleague said it counts because it was a indeed a technical school."
I want help breaking into the finance field,So I want to do a job where I can come to someone’s side and help them sort their finances. Not so much working for big businesses and helping them out but the average working mom or college grad. I really do not know how to go down this rabbit hole or where to begin so anyone got any pointers. I graduated college with a double major in sports management and business. Next spring I’ll have my MBA. So sadly no finance degree. Also I’ll be working at liberty National to start off my post college career path

GPA or Co-op experience,What is more important for landing a full time job after graduation. I have co-op experiences in my major but im gpa is a 3.47/4.33. Will this low gpa prevent me from finding a full time gig?
Should I continue with online education after receiving my BS?,"I'm wondering if it's worth the time to continue my education with EGCC, an online community college.  I have a bachelor's degree from Texas A&M in Tech Management and minoring in Business. The reason I am now studying at EGCC is it is a free benefit from my mother's union job that family members may use. There are several free business associate's degrees I can get and am currently working on one. Each one should take 1 to 1 & 1/2 years to complete. I imagine the longer I stay the less time it will take to get each degree as they likely use some of the same courses. The classes typically aren't that difficult as it tends to just be a lot of writing. So it's free and takes up some time on my weekends.

The reason I'm posting this is I hear a lot of bad stuff about online schools and how employers will completely disregard them on a resume. I'm wondering if it is worth my time with these degrees. Since I already have the bachelor's I was thinking the extra degrees would at the very least show a willingness to learn/better myself. And like I said it's very little investment on my part. I would still like to get your opinions and any experience you have with the subject. Thanks!"
"What should I major in? Political Science, History or International Affairs? Which is decent for getting a job after college?","I'm interested in both but what is the more versatile degree for a career?

I'm an Economics Major as a 3rd year in my upper divison courses. And I hate it. My classes are difficult even with tutoring. My intro classes for Econ was basically theory with simple math, but these intermediate and advanced classes are basically Calculus level courses. And while I can do math, I'm not the biggest fan of it. I managed to pass with a c- in one of the major classes and a D in the other major class I'm taking, but I do not enjoy this. Plus, my GPA and my scholarship that's the reason I'm at this school is on dangerous ground after this semester. I might lose it if bad grades in Econ continue to happen.

I am an Econ major due to seeing the potential job and career opportunities in the field but I don't really want to do this as a life job and potentially losing my scholarship. I was thinking of switching to Liberal Arts major like Political Science, International Affairs or History. But I don't know if a stable job can come from that. Honestly, I'm just confused at this point. If anyone could advice or give some insight on the career opportunities on the three majors I mentioned, that would be great. I want to graduate as soon as possible, but my difficulties in major and switching has me stumped.



At this point, I'm just confused."
From BA degree to AA degree to then pursue my passion,"I hope what i'm posting goes here. I will take it down if it does not belong here.

Hi, i'm currently doing a BA degree in Mechanical Engineering in the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus and I am in my 4th year, 1st semester of study and I have 2 and a half years left.

I'm studying Mechanical Engineering because it can give me a better chance in living a comfortable life, but i'm getting tired of studying subjects that i cant decipher and feeling so alienated when hanging out with my classmates.

My true passion is drawing and getting to draw for concept art for a videogame company  or commissions, but studying art will cost me more compared to my current college which is cheaper and it doesn't provide decent courses.

I was thinking of finishing with a Associate's degree and work my way into practicing art and working a job to help me study art.

Would it be smart or convenient for me to finish with a Associate's degree and then find a job which will help me study and practice art?"
Waiter as an Introvert,"So I recently took an MBTI test and I was found to be an introvert at 96% (Meaning I was only 4% extroverted). 

I dislike social gatherings as they take away my energy instead of ""giving"" energy. I really dislike standing out. Etc, etc.

I work at a restaurant as a busboy, but I'm more of a half-server as we get very busy every night. 

I try to talk to customer only when necessary like ""Can I clear that plate for you?"" or ""How's everything going so far?"". 

Sometimes, unconsciously, I try to break my introverted-ness and talk to many people in a row (B/c its so busy). This makes me slur my words and to them, it would sound like gibberish. 

How do act ""like an extrovert"" while being an almost 100%, pure, introvert?

Simple yet highly marketable degrees?,"I’m Journalism grad, fresh outta college, working my first ever job in advertising. The pay isn’t bad but I’d like to work in a specialised field; one where I cannot be replaced by high schoolers willing to work for peanuts.

Since I have no student debt, I’d like to go back to college and specialise in something that’s marketable yet easy to learn. Maybe Finance or something IT related. 

What do you folks suggest?"
Will I be able to get a job with a Bachelors in Professional Studies(w/ I.T. Conf)?,"Little background.  30 something living in rural Tennessee.  Wife and 2 kids.  I've spent the last 13 years as an Assistant Manager at a grocery store.  That basically the extent of my work history.  

I've enrolled in an online degree at a state university.  Fully accredited, etc.  I'm a Senior with a couple semesters left.  Working 50hrs a week its impossible to commute to campus so I'm pretty much locked into an online program. 

Basically, the degree is a mix of business classes and some I.T. classes.  This is the website for an idea of the classes required in the degree:

https://tnecampus.org/programs/944/courses?institution=Middle%20Tennessee%20State%20University&program=Bachelor%20of%20Professional%20Studies%20-%20BPS-Professional%20Studies

Bachelor's Degree on Resume- Issues and concerns,"Hello, I hope to get more responses here. In 2010 I graduated from a local physical accredited college with a Bachelor's in Business Administration. The school closed in 2011. I've kept it off the resume in the beginning as I was tired of being told I was ""overqualified"" for positions. I ended up moving into the materials testing industry As I am now looking to forward my career and move into management I wish to put this back on. 

My concerns are with background checks, as the school closed the records got transferred to the state. However I do have copies of my diploma and transcripts. 

How do most HR departments handle closed schools with background checks? Has anyone with a closed college ever had issues?"
Should I Quit my Master Program as an Engineer and work at Amazon,"So im 8 weeks into my masters program as an engineer and finally got a job but it requires me to quit school. Should i quit school and go for this engineer job or just continue school and get my master degree. The thing is i work at amazon for two days which sucks and its part time. But at school i go for two days. And it just so happens that both work and school land on one day the same day which requires me to leave one of them. I have some work experience but not as much as this big company. But im also wanting this master degree since im 8 weeks into it and invested in it which makes me have to drop out.

Edit: thank you guys. Alot of great response. I think most of you guys choose school. I will continue this path."

How can I help prep my friend for a PA Game Warden entrance exam.,"I apologize in advance if this isn't the place, but I didn't know where else to go.  


As the title says, my friend would like to become a Deputy Game Warden in Pennsylvania. There is an entrance exam that she would have to take, but we're unsure what's on it. I have committed to helping her study and find a career outside of our current retail environment.  


 Is there anyone who could help guide us in the direction of what specifically she should brush up on? I've ordered some books on land management and ecology and we're going to go over our state's regulations and the like. We are also going to go over firearms safety and the various types of firearms, as I'm trained in that for work. Any additional recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Someone I know was killed on the job, and he'd probably want me to help her in any way I can. Thanks in advance!"
Worth staying a 5th year in college?,"
First-generation college student here, and I'm lost as heck.

I started college off as a Computer Science major at UC Irvine; I applied to the major since I've always been mathematically inclined and had messed with Code Academy but I didn't really know what I wanted to do, nor had I ever taken any CS classes. It kicked my a— my 1st year of college, and I had never felt worse: I only passed the first introductory course and failed the next class. I coasted until my Junior year by taking GE classes and not focusing on any upper divs.

Fast forward, my counselor decided it was best for me to switch into Sociology if I still wanted to graduate with a different major on time. Me being me, I followed her advice since I figured she would know more than me.

Now as a senior in college, the sociology classes that I am taking are okay—they're interesting—but I don't know what type of job I could get out of college? I haven't considered graduate school for Sociology because I'm not too fond of the major.

As I stated, I love math, but after coming to college, I feel like I am not as smart as I thought I was in high school. I was thinking about switching into Business Economics since I've taken a good amount of Econ courses which I enjoyed, and I've passed all of the math classes required for the major already.

Given that, I would have to stay a 5th year in college to get my BA degree in Business Economics. Is it worth staying if my 5th year is covered by FAFSA? Could I get a business job with a Sociology degree?

Edit: I would not have to take out loans for a 5th year"
Love animals but can’t see blood,"So I’m a high schooler and I’m nearing my senior year so I should really know what I wanna study in college. I love animals so working with them is my dream. Problem is I can’t see blood, not even a drop.. so that cancels out being a vet. Also my dad really just wants me to have a “regular job” and doesn’t think working with animals is going to support me. Soooo if anyone can list me job opportunities that work with animals as well as required education it would be gladly appreciated."

Best field of medical technology to study in?,"I was speaking about the future of medicine with a patient and he brought up how the medical field is using more technology and ai while diagnosing and treating patients. This lit a spark in me and now I am driven to start studying it and building a career around it. however when i looked up programs for it there are so many options that it is kind of hard to narrow down exactly which path I want to proceed down. 

Right now I am a medical assistant working in a pain management clinic and have been for the past 5 years. I have gained a bit of knowledge and experience in this field so Anesthesiology tech would probably make the most sense but I would also love to learn more about bio tech.

In your opinions what would be the path that would provide the most growth and/or be the most interesting to study?"

I’m stressing out on what I should do in the future.,"So i’m pretty much stuck on a limbo here. My passion is videography such as video editing, i have had temporary jobs then and there but have trouble getting a permanent job in that field.

I currently work casually as a kitchen hand, i do enjoy the environment, but it’s still a casual job. I could work part time, but the pay isn’t that great.

While I’ll continue doing what I love, i decided to go back studying on something that gives me a higher chance in getting a permanent job.

I’m thinking of studying tafe (technical school), most likely in business administration so i could get an office job. Do you have to be incredibly good in maths and communicating with people? 

I have a weakness in that i stumble my words alot and have anxiety, also i failed maths class in high school. When i go job searching, they always ask for people with good accuracy and strong communicating skills and I feel like I’m not up for it.

What’s your experience in admin or any other entry level office jobs? Should i study something else that’s more suitable for me?"
What are some behind-the-scene jobs in the entertainment industry?,"I'm writing this for a friend of mine. She's been struggling to find her path in life, bouncing around from one idea to another.

She has an amazing voice, great personality, fantastic storyteller, and comedian! Maybe I'm biased. She's expressed that she's always wanted to get into the entertainment industry, but has lacked the confidence to pursuit it.

"People who switched to software dev from a different career, how did you manage the transition?","As title says. I'm fed up with law and I have great interest (and some knowledge) in programming. I wonder, as a 33 y/o man what would be the best path to manage the transition considering I have no savings to be jobless for what I reckon is at least one year of studying (even more if I wanted to enroll in CS, but I seriously doubt is a viable option for me, at least for now). 

I live in Europe and I'm fairly available to relocate if necessary."
Help cutting down hours at work for school,"So recently, I moved from a cashier position to the service desk. At my store, a grocery store, we're severely understaffed on the entire front end, but even more so on the service desk. When it got dire for the managers they decided to make it either part-time or a full-time position.

The idea being, that the part of the shift where the desk would be empty, 6-10 would be covered by the part-time employee. When they brought this up, I told them I was interested. It worked out to be about 20 hours a week with what one supervisor suggested, and it worked perfectly with my school hours. Well, next week will be my first week, and 37 hours. I'm in college right now, full time on campus. I'm up there two days a week because I pushed them all onto that one day. 

I feel kinda annoyed because the one who schedules us is known for doing stuff like this. ""Okay, so I have college starting that week so I need to hit about 20 hours..."" and then somehow we hit 35 hours.   
But more importantly, although I will be able to make it through next week, I want to ask you guys for some advice on how to talk to this manager. And arrive it home that anything above \~25 hours won't work for me this semester.

I'm willing to give her the benefit of doubt, last semester I was online part-time. I could work full flexibility and was aiming for \~35 hours a week. But I thought that I made it clear to her at the beginning of the semester that I would have to drastically drop my hours, and I thought that the supervisor made it pretty clear that this was a part-time position, not full time. (Company defines full time like 35-40 hours a week, they don't like overtime)

I like the service desk, it's a great place for me. Especially since checking is really hard on my body with the medicines I'm on. So, do you guys have any advice? I would, of course, prefer to stay at the service desk, but I need to drop those hours, by about 12 at least. I'm not sure how to start this discussion with her, after having talked already. And I'm also not even sure what to say or anything. So, ideas anybody?"

Graduating in a couple semesters with a degree in Business. What are my options.,"I've been a pseudo- Assistant Manager in retail for the past 13 years.  Basically a glorified sticker with a set of keys.  It has convinced me that I don't want to have anything to do with retail or management though.  In a couple semesters, I should hopefully have a Bachelors Degree in Business with a slight concentration in I.T.  Lost as to what I should do now though.

Additional skills in pursuit of being a Policy Advisor (NZ),"Hello,

I'm on my last year of university (I'm 24 years old) completing my Bachelor of Arts majoring in Political Science. I want to become a Policy Advisor here in NZ. There is a fair amount of jobs at the moment (about 495+) so I assume there will be roughly the same at the start of next year.

Because I don't have an additional major such as Public Policy (although I've studied it in my current major), Law, Statistics or Philosophy and its a little late to add it on, is it a good idea to pursue a Certification/Certificate in Technical Writing and perhaps Statistical Analysis? There are some online certifications I'm eligible for.

Would this help give me a bit of an edge when it comes to finding jobs once my degree is completed? I'm currently learning our native language ""Te Reo Maori"" as its a sort after language and much of the job ads are now written in English and Te Reo Maori.

Thank you for any help you may give.

Cheers,

Looking to develop new skills that could lead to Work-At-Home opportunities,"I currently work as a painter (paint homes, condos, etc.) but I've always wanted to work from home. For personal reasons, I want to make it my goal to mostly work from home within the next couple of years. 

I'd like to explore different options on what type of work is out there. Either it be freelancing, contractual, or working for a company. As I do have income requirements, these options would need to at least pay my living expenses in a MCOL/HCOL area.

I know it will come down to what skills I posses. I do have accounting experience, but I'd like to take the time to learn new skills. School isn't the best option for me at this time (student debt and like to stay home when I'm off). However I'm decent when it comes to learning something on my own.

Would like to hear from you guys on what you think!

Thanks in advanced."

I’m sure this is such a cliche thing but I want to get a degree (preferably 4 years) in a safe field where I can reasonably expect to make +/- 100k after let’s say 5-7 years.

Personally, I’ve never been much of a school person, although I’ve always loved psychology. I want a job where I can live comfortably, and support myself. I’d also like to have some what of a balance between work, and home life. 

I don’t have too much money right now, and am not sure if I’d even be able to pay for all those years of college. Although, I’m told I’d be able to get a free ride due to my situation 

I guess I’m just scared if I choose to go into carpentry, I may regret it later. I don’t have too many friends, and feel I should get the “college experience.” I just don’t know what to really do. I also wanted to use college so I could get dorming, because I’m temporarily living at my grandmothers until I can get on my two feet.

Are there any medical coders in here? Can you tell me about it?,"Hi there, I'll keep things short. My current job is incredibly slow, and didn't pay well in the first place. Due to unnatural confidence issues, I've always stayed at this one job (carpet cleaning), from the ages of 20 to 29. I have a new boss as of a year ago, and he can't get business to save his life. My savings are being dug into. I'm under $2K in my personal savings, though I do have a windfall in a separate account of about $30K, so I'm not desperate, but I also do NOT want to rely on that money. If I do, it'll be gone before I know it.

Life specific details out of the way, that brings me to the point of this thread. Can any medical coders tell me how you feel about the job? Specifically:

1. Is it a low/medium stress environment?
2. Is it good for someone that has a history with (but is also getting over) social anxiety?
3. How much schooling is typically required?
4. How much does the schooling typically cost?
5. Are there opportunities for part time and full time work?

I'm ready to turn things around, and I have no idea how I got started on thinking about medical coding, but from what I have seen, it could be right up my alley. I'm a pretty frugal guy, and I'm just looking for something with ok pay and, most of all, stability. Not just in pay and hours, but in the work load that comes in. I'm not a fan of surprises, I prefer my work days to be somewhat predictable.

Online universities that turn hiring managers away?,"As the title said, what online universities are frowned upon by hiring managers? I've looked into so many universities, but I never thought about how the degree might play into getting hired. Out of all the online universities I've looked into, Liberty University, Western Governors University, and Grand Canyon University are my top 3 picks that I would *like* to attend. I've read a lot of things about for-profit Christian schools (which I think LU and maybe GCU fall under) being something that hiring managers don't particularly like to see.

This is all assuming that I would have little to no experience and my only selling point is my degree."
Is a major in Computer Science or Informatics better for general job opportunities?,"Hi all!

So I attend Indiana University, and here the two big majors in our School of Informatics and Computing are, obviously, Informatics and Computer Science. We don't have a super successful or established program, but we do pretty well and graduates from both majors typically end up in high-paying jobs. 

I'm currently an Informatics major, but I am thinking about switching to Computer Science. I've heard from lots of people both in the CS program and in the workforce that majoring in CS will ultimately give me more job opportunities. I feel like I'm learning more useful and tangible skills in my intro to programming class (a CS class that I'm taking for an Info credit), where we're learning Python. In contrast, what I'm learning in my Informatics classes is... relatively interesting, but not super helpful? It's pretty much just learning about how technology interacts with society, the ethics behind technology, etc. I love learning and researching these things, but truthfully while I'm here paying a bunch of money in college I'd like to learn more skills that I can take with me to the work force.

The jobs that I'm interested in mainly include software engineering/development, web development, UX/UI design, and similar jobs. Would a Computer Science degree help me in getting these jobs more than an Informatics degree would? I personally have a hard time explaining what Informatics is to people, but apparently it's great if you want to work in front-end stuff (which I might be interested in).

Sorry for the block of text! Any thoughts on which major might be best?"
College educations on job applications,"I’m worried about my degree being seen as less than compared to someone that has a specific degree. I going get associates in general education with a lot of business classes; the only reason I didn’t get a business degree is that I wasn’t sure that’s what I wanted. Going into college, I wasn’t sure about which classes to take, so I wanted to be able to experiment without having to change my major every time the wind changed direction. I’m only a semester away from my degree, and someone told me that employers might look down on my degree because they might see me as uncommitted and impulsive. Can anyone offer any more insight? When I go for my bachelor's it will be in a more specific field, but I need to get a job soon. Thank you."
Struggling to find jobs with an English Degree,"Last year I graduated with an English degree. I had a temp administrative assistant job where I went to college for three months, but then they filled the position. Since then I have been unemployed and really struggling. 

I had one interview a couple of weeks ago. I didn't get that job. I have another interview coming up this week for another administrative job. I really hope I get this one, but I'm not too confident about it given my luck this past year. 

Aside from administrative work, I'm struggling to come up with jobs that I would be suited for given my degree. 

I don't want to teach, and I feel like writing/editing aren't good options since they would need to be freelance/don't pay that well, even though I think I would enjoy doing those. 

I know I made a bad decision in what I studied, and now I have to live with it, but I'm finding it very difficult to get along. 

Does anyone have suggestions for what I might be able to do with this degree, besides burn it for warmth?"
Does a boot camp make sense for me? (x-post cscareerquestions),"Hey all.

I'm a 35 year old guy who was told a couple of weeks ago that he's being let go. I was a consultant for a very boutique firm, specializing in fleet management. About 5 years ago, I received my MBA with a concentration in Supply Chain & Analytics. I'm currently interviewing at a few places. I have 3 second round interviews coming up this week, mostly in the consulting space (but for which, I'm kind of meh about).

​

I didn't get a chance to build a ton of skills at the current role, focusing mainly on Excel and Lime Survey. I did get a chance to write reports, so my communication and writing skills are pretty strong. I also got the opportunity to visit with clients face to face. I have some PM experience in my background as well.

​

I'm trying to determine next steps. I believe tech is going to continue to grow but, outside of some SQL and Tableau lessons I took a year and a half ago, I have virtually no coding skills. No Python. No R. No VBA.

​

My question is this: would a bootcamp make sense for me? I could see myself being a data scientist or senior data scientist pretty easily. I have about 15K saved up and can move anywhere. That being said, would it make sense to take a pay cut for a couple of years in exchange for a broader set of coding skills? Thanks in advance."

"Is a 'Conjoint' Bachelor's degree (Bachelor of Business/Bachelor of Arts, 4 year degree) gained in New Zealand marketable in the United States?","I am currently halfway through a conjoint Bachelor's degree in my home country of New Zealand. The specific degree is a [Bachelor of Business/Bachelor of Arts](https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/learning/programme-course/programme.cfm?prog_id=93156) which I am studying at Massey University. My majors are Management and Economics, respectively. 

I am a dual citizen of the United States and NZ and have wanted to live in the US for a while now. I initially planned on moving after I finished high school, but decided to stay and complete my degree in NZ as tuition is so much cheaper here. I started off doing the 3-year Bachelor of Business degree, but a family member in the US told me that he thought a 3-year degree would not be marketable in the United States and said I should try to find a 4-year degree which recruiters would see as equivalent to a 4-year American Bachelor's degree. I found the conjoint program which seemed like a great option as it allowed me to attain two 3-year degrees over 4 years. 

Basically, I have two questions. Is this a marketable degree in the US? Generally speaking, would this be comparable to a 4-year Bachelor's degree in the eyes of a recruiter, or possibly even stronger? I'm not too picky about which field I work in, but I'd rather not complete another degree (i.e. an MBA) after completing this conjoint degree as I will have had enough of studying by that point. I'm not ruling out the possibility of completing an MBA or similar further down the track, but it's not something I'd like to do right now. 

My second question is; I have been studying over the summer and not taken any breaks since starting my degree as I don't want to take a long break if it's not necessary. I have already done one semester last summer and will be beginning another summer school semester in a couple of weeks. After the summer school semester, I will only have 14 classes worth of credits to take. My plan was to split classes over the next 4 semesters so I took two semesters of 4 classes and two semesters of 3 classes. I intended on studying through both main semesters of 2020 and then going on to do summer school again over summer of 2020 (end of the year for us). Then I would only have one more semester worth of classes to complete (Semester One 2020), and could theoretically have completed the two Bachelor's degrees in June 2021. I began study in February 2018. So roughly 3 and a half years. I told the same US family member about this and he advised against it, saying:

> ""You are pursuing a dual 4 year degree program so the degrees will be accepted by US employers as equivalent to a US 4 year bachelor degree.  So I think it best for you to take the full 4 years to get your 4 year degree.  Just spread it out appropriately.  Otherwise I can see confusion in the US as to whether you have an equivalent 4 year degree or you have two 3 year degrees which wouldn’t be seen as the same.  Take the full 4 years!""

Is this accurate information? It seems to me like it would be in my best interest to complete the degree as fast as I can, so long as I am motivated and able to do so. This would mean I can start looking for a job sooner and making a full-time income. I also have a long-term relationship and I plan on moving there with my GF and getting married, so completing the degree sooner would allow us to focus on this process and getting everything established in a new country. But I wouldn't want to rush the degree if it would hurt my chances of getting a job.

I am just feeling confused about a few things and would love advice from someone who better understands the system in the US and how international degrees such as mine are viewed. Thanks so much!"
Does a business associates count for anything?,"I just dropped out of a 4 year program with 2 years to go due to severe burn out. I just discovered though, with two more basic classes, I could have an associate degree in business.

Competing against everyone else on the internet who could apply to the same internet job listings was hopeless. I applied to 500+ jobs before I left. Thanks to taking a year to find a job after college, and then being laid off after the company went under, my resume looks bad compared to someone with a solid 2 or 3 years at one company and a business degree. I have misc. marketing experience to fill the gaps to an extent, but nothing serious. Mostly volunteering. 

There is no way I can return to the US without being in the same exact situation unless I make a major change to my resume. What skills can I add to my resume to give myself a boost? I think that some SEO or Google Analytics or programming certificates could really help my case, especially if I highlight them properly in my resume."

Biology majors,"Hello everyone!

Not sure if I'm in the right place for this question but I'm going to ask it anyways.

So, I'm in my mid twenties and wanting to give college another go. I was enrolled in IT a few years back and just didn't enjoy the field as much as I thought I would even though the job market for it is booming right now. So I took a few years off to decide what I wanna do. I've came to the conclusion that I would really love to do something in the science field. 

My community college recently switched their Biology major from a transfer degree to a BS. I was considering enrolling next semester but I'm curious as to what the job opportunities are looking like at this moment. Also, how difficult is it to get your foot in the door with just an associates?

My goal would be to work at a wildlife/habitat conservation center or maybe in my state's department of natural resources. Obviously I wont turn down any good paying job in a science related field though.

So, I'm curious as to how difficult it was for you guys to land a decent job after getting your degree and what kind of job were you able to get to put a foot in the door?

Thank you!"

i have a learning disability and dropped out of high school. what jobs are available for people like me?,"i know this will open me up to criticism but i really want advice! i have an intellectual disability and ive always suffered educationally. it is too much for me and i stopped participating in high school! 

i turn 18 next year and i really want to be independent. i am kind of an immature person but i really am determined to push past that and make a living for myself. i want to be able to have an apartment and live on my own and just be an adult!

the only job i hear thrown around for people in my situation is mcdonalds. i dont have an aversion to the idea of working there, but is that my only option? do i have any others? i struggle a lot with social interactions however i know socializing is very necessary in a job so i am open to jobs where you might have to be social.

i also would like to know what the best paying may be? i know that any job a person like me can get isnt going to make me rich, but im sure 7 dollars an hour and 10 dollars an hour make a worlds difference to somebody less fortunate with money.

also, benefits are a thing but im not sure how those work? do they play into this at all? is somebody like me even qualified for them?

i live in america by the way on the west coast if it matters. i come from a pretty well off background so i know i wont get to experience ""luxury"" ike i do now, but thats reality for some people and it may just be mine too. also im sorry if this post is in a bad format, im not really somebody who makes submissions. :)"

Getting a good job without a degree,"So my husband has been a chef for about 10 years and now wants to leave this job for one with better hours and a better career path.

Only problem is that he doesnt have a degree and his GCSEs arent great. As he was dyslexic he didnt get much help at school and subsequently had a bad experience with learning so wont go back to college (I know, I've tried to convince him but he wont go, we would struggle financially if he did this plus the courses would cost nearly 1.2k) main ones he is missing are maths and english, he can read and write well and his maths is better than mine and I got a B at GCSE.

So my question is, are there any tips for getting in at a good job/company without having great qualification? Loads of jobs ask for minimum of grade C maths and English, or require degree level education even if they havent specified what degree they want!

What are some career paths for people with degrees in gender or queer studies?,"I’ve often heard people tell me that a degree in gender studies, women’s studies, or queer studies is a useless degree and that there aren’t a lot of options out there when it comes to jobs. I’m open to that sort of feedback because I know it’s not as straightforward as degrees that have a clearer path like becoming a doctor or something. 
But with all that said I am still very much interested in getting a degree in queer studies because I would still love to have that a degree in something that is precious to me under my belt. I’m not sure what I want to do specifically yet but I know this is something I want to learn about and I know I would love for my future job to involve helping and supporting the LGBT community.
I would love to hear from people who have a degree in gender studies and hear about what paths they’ve taken after their degree and what sort of options are out there with that degree. All feedback is welcome though as long as you’re kind about it!

MBA Question,"Hi Guys,

I have recently been juggling whether or not to get my MBA. Here's my situation:

I am in my early 20's graduated with my bachelors in finance about 3-4 years ago after graduating early. For the past 3-4 years I have been in and out of accounting to finance positions. Currently I work in a senior accounting position managing a department of 3 (non-staff accountants, not an accounting manager). My short-term/Medium term goal right now is to work as a senior financial analyst in a medium to large size company, or an accounting manager (upward progression). Eventually I would want to be head of corporate valuations or a controller/CFO. Would 100% like to stay corporate and non-bank, I like my work life balance.

I recently came across an opportunity to go back and get my MBA with a concentration in Finance. Not a top 10 school however AACSB accredited, and a lot cheaper. The MBA in finance would kill two birds with one stone for me, as I need 3 more classes that I can't afford to be eligible for my CPA, plus the MBA part would be great too.

Currently I have around 20k in debt from my bachelors. This is not overwhelming in any means, and very manageable. After grants, scholarships etc. I would be looking to add another 20k to my debt in order to finish the whole masters program.

I'm kind of yo-yoing back and forth as to whether or not this would be worth taking on the new debt. I realize top 10 schools would be better for job, networking all that, however it's just simply out of my means as it stands right now.

Would this be a reasonable decision to go? Just looking for some advice and wise words from all you more experienced working class.

Thank you in advance!"

BA Graduates: Who works in the field of which they studied in?,"I graduated with a BA in Geography 2 years ago, but shortly after graduating i started working in Medical device sales and make around 70k (1.5 years in). My initial plan was to segue the job experience into something related to my studies but almost all well paying jobs related to Geography require a BS or engineering background. 

&#x200B;

My university friends who have the same degree either still work entry level jobs ( retail et cetera), got into unrelated private sector jobs like myself, or work fairly low wage hourly jobs related to geography ( Surveying, data entry, private school teachers ( that don't even necessarily require a degree) feelsbadman.jpg). 

&#x200B;

It seems like BA degrees on  their own are fairly useless to getting a lucrative career within the related fields of studies, and only useful to overcome most jobs barrier to entry requirements of having an undergrad degree. Ive seen a lot of other friends with BA degrees in Communications, psychology, Environment, English etc etc all either jump ship to something unrelated, get stuck in minimum wage retail jobs or stick it out with low wage jobs related.

Any success stories of BA graduates that got a dream job?"
Majoring in Physics was the biggest mistake of my life.,"When I was choosing a major in college I didn’t have the option of choosing an engineering discipline so I chose the closest thing I could, physics. I loved the school and wanted to stay, but I also wanted to get into an engineering career. When I was discussing this with my parents, my father told me not to worry because engineering and physics are so closely related that I wouldn’t have a problem finding an engineering position post-graduation. “You will be able to tell the engineers what’s wrong with their designs,” he would say, and I blindly believed him. 

So I graduated and started looking for engineering jobs but I didn’t seem to be qualified for any entry level ones. I thought to myself, “That’s just cause you don’t have any experience. You learn these things on the job, just find something to get yourself started in the engineering world and you’ll find your way.” I eventually figured out that with my degree, I was most qualified for Test Engineering jobs. That’s got the word engineer in it, I must be on the right track! 

I got a job as a Test Engineer and quickly realized it wasn’t the type of engineering I thought it would be, but the pay wasn’t bad so I sucked it up and worked. After a few years I wanted to take on more responsibility and since there was no room for growth in this particular company, I started looking for other jobs. I thought, “I have some experience, I can get an engineering job now.” So I searched and searched and quickly realized that I am in no way qualified for an engineering position. I don’t feel like I have any actual skills. I used to be able to do math and stuff, and I took simple electronics classes in my physics coursework, but it’s been so long that I don’t remember how to do it anymore. Now I’m working in systems engineering, essentially making sure test plans and reports aren’t written at a second grade level (which many of them are) and I’m so bored. I don’t know where my career path will go, but I’m sure now that I don’t have the education to pull off an engineering job.

I don’t know why I’m posting this, to be honest. I think I just needed to get it out. Maybe I’m looking for direction too. IDK."

"MBA, will it help my career? Unranked vs highly ranked (same AACSB accreditation).","I live in Michigan and currently have a BA in English (long story short, I didn't know what I wanted to do but my parents said I needed a degree so I got one). I work in fundraising as an admin assistant making $46K.

I recently discovered that I enjoy financial math and would love to pursue a career in business finance or maybe financial advising. Not sure as of yet.

Anyways, I've been accepted into the MBA program at Eastern Michigan University. I could have applied at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business but the difference in the cost of the program is astronomical.

Currently, I have student loan debt totaling around $40K. My employer will pay 75% of my tuition. If I go to EMU, I can afford the remaining tuition out of pocket without taking out more loans. If I decided to apply and was accepted to Michigan Ross, I would need to take out more loans.

I only started questioning my EMU decision after I read that an MBA from an unranked program isn't useful...but Michigan Ross is highly ranked...

What should I do? Is the extra debt worth going to a top 20 program? Or would the EMU degree be worth it since I won't accrue more debt and I am changing career paths? Help!!

TL;DR: I've been accepted into the MBA program at Eastern Michigan University, my employer will pay 75% and I can afford the remainder out of pocket. I started questioning going there after I read that MBAs from unranked programs are useless. I could apply to the University of Michigan Ross School of Business but it would mean adding to my $40k current student loan debt. Would it be worth it?"

Is a Masters degree really worth it?,"Hello!

First time poster, but I thought I’d ask around a couple subreddits to get the a wider perspective of a major life decision I’ve been heming and hawing about for half a decade: Is a Masters degree going to help me find a job? 

 So here’s  my perspective. I graduated in 2013 with a BS in Biology and since then I’ve been working as a lab tech and worked my way up to a team lead position (basically pays the same and have the same work, but I also cover some of the more basic coordinating stuff and sometimes attend as a department rep when my boss is out). A couple years ago I wanted a new job and I COULD NOT GET INTERVIEWS. I applied, and applied, and applied but I just wasn’t getting calls. I’m not sure if my resume was awful or just didn’t meet the job experience expectations.  So, I figure if I can’t update my resume if I can’t get a new job maybe I should get more education. I got a couple of certifications through work (six sigma and excel certifications) and I worked for about a year studying for the GRE, taking it, and applying for a Non-thesis Biology graduate program. I can take classes for a couple years and then I’ll have a Masters in Biology. Great plan right?

Well, now I’m not so sure. What if I go through all this time and money, and I still can’t find a better job? Or now I’m a grossly overqualified lab tech who’s applying for jobs that pay $15 an hour but I’m expecting more since I have a Masters, but I lack industry experience for the typical jobs someone with a Masters applies for? My SO asked what job I’d want after school, and I said I wanted the same job just more money (but I don’t think they’ll pay a lab tech more to press buttons a machine just because I went to school for s couple more years) Is a Masters even necessary once you get to a certain point of job experience (Does someone with a MS and 1-2 of experience trump someone with 10+ years with a BS) My graduate school advisor was unhelpful bless her heart. She said that typically students who are non thesis MS either become teachers or go on to medical school, so she couldn’t tell me placement stats for my situation post-school.  My HR department couldn’t advise me either (“It’s a case by case basis. If someone doesn’t have a degree but has more applicable laboratory experience than another candidate, we have made exceptions since this is a hands on field”). 

I don’t want to go into debt if I can’t be guaranteed a better job position than what I currently have. Is a MS worth it? Has it been worth if for you? What sounds like the best decision?"
What fields can I break into by adding a certificate/associate's degree on top of my (useless) liberal arts BA? Has that worked for anyone here?," Beyond going back to school for a different 4 year degree, what kind of education can you get that means something to a potential employer? Before I left the US to teach English in Vietnam I had applied to 500+ jobs after getting laid off. I was only at my first job for a year, and it took me a year of unemployment after college to find that job. 

&#x200B;

So, before leaving for Ho Chi Minh City, I had been unemployed for an additional 1.5 years and my spotty, unemployment-filled resume coupled with my German and Scandinavian Studies degree made me an unappealing candidate to say the least. Without additional transferable experience or valuable education that isn't teaching-related, if/when I decide to move back to the USA, I am just going to be in the same position again. 

&#x200B;

My resume includes a few years of various digital marketing volunteer gigs and a couple internships. By the time I leave Asia there will also be a few years of teaching English on my resume which is either great or perceived as an extended vacation depending on the employer. 

&#x200B;

Some examples of education I hope could jump start my transition into a new phase of life:

* paralegal certificate
* IT/Programming certificates
* digital marketing related certificate like SEO
* digital marketing related programming 
* something that could lead to international work because I have experience adapting to a new culture
* watchmaking school (one of my interests)

So, I must be missing a lot here... what else can you think of? Has doing this worked for you? Please keep in mind that this post is angled towards liberal arts degree holders."

Can my major GPA save me?,"So Iv done pretty terribly throughout college, on and off academic probation, currently have a 2.4. Oddly enough though I actually do really well in the more challenging courses. Iv gotten plenty of Fs and Ds but they are mostly coming from classes like Rec and Leisure studies, nutrition, etc. I just lose interest in that stuff and flunk while courses like accounting and macro Econ I do pretty well because the challenge keeps me engaged. Iv also started medication for ADHD and I’m just blowing through courses easily now, I was getting B-As on finals with little study bringing up bad grades from missed assignments and what not but now medicated I do all the boring stuff, study and the tests are always easy As for me. 

So my question is how bad does this look and with continued success how much does it help. I’m starting 4th year and going to need a 5th to finish. I can probably get 3.5+ on major GPA and maybe list deans list student for 3-4 consecutive semesters. My hope is someone might look at my application and see GPA isn’t great but pulled it together at the end. Is that at all likely?

"""Don't Tell Them You Are in School""","After many years with only two years of college under my belt, I decided to return to University to finish obtaining a bachelor's degree. 

I am pretty miserable at my present job and have a potential opportunity to move to a job that offers benefits that I do not have, but it comes with a pay cut. As much as I don't care for the idea of going backwards, I thought I could still make it work, as I would have the opportunity for quick advancement. 

An acquaintance of mine scheduled my interview for next week, saying he'd rather do it on his day off instead of Monday. I commented in passing that worked for me, as I have Summer classes starting on Monday. He seemed surprised that I was in school and told me that I shouldn't mention that in any of my interviews, as his company wanted people that they felt would be devoted to the job. I told him it was a little late for that, as I had mentioned it on my application. 

Frankly, I feel disheartened. And although I will still go to the interview, it gives me pause as to whether I want to bother working for the company (should I be offered a position), as I am not willing to give up on my education now. Most of my classes are online, as I work 40+ hours a week now with crazy hours; but there will come a time when I may need to take a few classes on campus. My present job is at least supportive of my endeavor, even if I am not happy.

I thought a pursuit of education would be considered an admirable quality, if anything. It's been over a decade since I have been on a job hunt. Is this par for the course?"

Ivey, Queens AND Schulich were listed below normal York finance students.  Now my question to you is what may be the reason for this?

Business Management Graduate - Job Hunt,"Hi there,

I have the choice of these 7 majors to get a full ride for. Please help me decide because I've no idea what I want.,"Hi all,

So I have the opportunity to obtain one of these seven degrees tuition free, with the only caveat being that it has to be completely online.

The majors are: Biological Sciences, Software Engineering, Information Technology, Computer Information Systems, Business - Global Leadership, Urban Planning, or Philosophy.

I've always wanted to work with animals. So naturally growing up, my first instinct was to become a wildlife biologist. I still think it would be fun, I love working outdoors and have experience sea Kayak guiding where we came in contact with seals and whales.

However I don't know if a degree in Biological Sciences is enough to stand me out against people with degrees in Wildlife Biology or Marine Biology. Never mind the fact that an online Biology degree will be boring, as there are no labs or hands on experiments to conduct.

So I thought I should do something in demand like Software Engineering. I love computers, I love video games, but I've grown up with a disposition against math. I seem to have a heavy issue with mathematics, even advanced algebra has given me trouble. It's most likely because my ability to focus is hindered by ADD and DPDR, but I believe if I really need to get through a math class, I can take some modafinil and study hard all day. Do I love the idea of working on a computer all day, No, unless I'm working for a company I find interesting such as Bethesda, Reddit, or Google. I imagine being a person who has no experience coding that just because I have a degree in Software Engineering I would be hard pressed to get a job at these companies, right? I don't know about this one.

Then it makes sense that If I can't engineer software, I could learn to work with it right? Information technology surely can produce a high paying salary, I'd imagine. Same with Computer Information Systems.

Alternatively, Business - Global Leadership sounds sort of like International Business. I'm not sure how business degrees work, if they do land you high paying jobs in companies, or what I would even do.

Urban Planning sounds cool in it's idea. As does Philosophy. But we know where that route goes.

Some people have recommended me a Master in Business Intelligence and Big Data which could be interesting for my formation, but its expensive (affordable, but expensive) and will demand me to invest 20 hours weekly aside of my 40 hours per week job.  
I don't want to ""*ruin*"" the next two years of my life in a 60 hours routine just to have a paper, but if it really makes the difference in the future I can make the effort.

Do you have any thoughts/experiences about this topic?

Online courses for tech skills,"**also posted in r/csquestions**

Hi guys,

I'm looking to make a career change from finance to tech—roles relating to customer support, onboarding, documentation, or sales. Since I don't have a degree in anything tech related or any job experience in tech (however, I have significant experience in customer facing roles), I would love to take some online courses to be able to put on my resume and to get a working knowledge of the industry.  Are there any reputable online courses that you recommend for me to take?

Why would a former employer contact your university and request transcripts?,"Not sure if this belongs here, but I couldn't find any information on the internet and I'm really baffled. Today I got an email from my university Records Department :

I haven't worked at this place for over three years, and completely put them out of my mind to be honest. Why would they request my transcript, and would there be any negative consequences if I chose not to comply? Some advice would be helpful.

How should I let my boss know about being sick?,"Heyo! 

So last week, on Monday someone was covid positive and everyone could not come back unless tested negative(so the office was closed on Tuesday). I took a test on Wednesday and I immediately went back to work since I was negative. As the week went on, when I went to work on Friday I was coughing a bit (had a mask on and sanitized and washed hands regularly, no one was around me). I believe I became sick because I ate sesame seeds last Sunday (which I’m allergic too) and as the week went on my throat became a tiny bit itchy, then small coughs on Friday and Saturday, and now today with a stuffy nose and congestion. How should I let my boss know that maybe I should work from home for a bit, or just until it clears up because you never know?"

I am currently only 14 years old, and I was looking for some way to produce income during my free time whilst in quarantine.

"COVID Crushed My Career, What do I do now?","Hey folks, the gist is this:   
I'm an entertainment lighting specialist. Primarily I work as a lighting director operating consoles and putting up rigs for concerts, festivals, theatre etc. For the last 2ish years I've had steady work, primarily in touring family entertainment shows. Last year I made about 60k before taxes. Its my dream job, I'm good at it and I love it.

  
In March, my current tour, future tours, and plan B local gigs all vanished with the pandemic. I have booked one weekend gig for the foreseeable future, in the season I'm normally working 80 hours a week. I have robust savings because I've always known my job to be feast or famine, and government aid plus EI will keep me afloat for a good amount of time. However, I can't help but feel like the entertainment industry will take years to get even close to what it was. Shows that actually pay enough to be worthwhile need big audiences, big venues, and most notably, big insurance policies that currently no one is giving out. It's also extremely hard work. On tour I'll work an average of 100 hours a week, sometimes we'll do 14 show days in a row.   


I'm computer savvy, I have basic programming and networking knowledge, should I be going back to school for a basic CS/Networking diploma and get myself out of this? Pursue a trade maybe? I don't want to throw away a career I spent 6 years building but I can't just wait and see what happens while my savings ebb away. 

TLDR: Chosen field of work has ceased to exist during the pandemic, do I wait it out or abandon ship?"
Furloughed to permanently laid off.,"I just got laid off. The company furloughed most of us for 3 months while paying our insurance.

Now, I just got a call today and I have been laid off permanently. 

a month before the furlough. I helped my company enrolled in a quite lucrative and prestigious project (in my industry at least) based on my past position. In fact, I was offered a position in December (higher salary) by a competing firm and turned it down TWICE. 

I wanted to stay with my company, I figured at the time, since I helped the company with this project, there would be room for me to grow. 

Covid happened, I got furloughed. My boss assured me everything is fine. He said he appreciated my help with the project including his boss. He even said based on what he saw in the financial documents, our company was in good shape etc.


Now 3 months later, they're bringing some people back but they're laying off some including me. 

I know this is just how it is and how things are. But I can't help but feel like I'm not appreciated and felt like I was used.  Now, the project that I helped them with most likely would get them more work in the future. 
I've reached out to the other company whose offers I turned down twice. But I don't think they'll want me now. I did turn them twice. Oh well."

"I'm back at work after being furloughed due to COVID-19, and the anxiety is getting to be too much. What can I do?","(In Canada/British Columbia!) I was laid off of my retail job in March, and then brought back a little over a week ago. My anxiety is just building higher and higher as the days go on - none of the customers care, no one's respecting social distancing, and I feel like the safety procedures put in place aren't as good as I was expecting when I agreed to come back. I'm on my second day off and I honestly feel sick to my stomach at the thought of needing to work five days in a row starting tomorrow.

I would quit if I could, but there are no jobs where I'm currently at because COVID and I can't afford to just quit without another job. I don't imagine I would be allowed to go back on CERB, but honestly, if I knew things would be like this I would have asked to be furloughed for longer - people are being so horrendously inconsiderate to the safety of others, especially employees. Does anyone have any advice or ideas for what I can do? I know this is a vague post with probably no solution, but I just don't know what to do and I feel terrible."
Should i go in to office today- under the weather,"There’s only a few of us in the office. Woke up today with a bad headache, stuffy nose, and my asthma is acting up.

I got covid and couldn’t work for a month. I tried contacting my shift manager 3 days ago and she ghosted me.,"So, like I said in the title, I ended up getting covid and couldn’t go back to my job as a waitress when they reopened. I was sick for a really long time because I have Asthma, but luckily I’m finally feeling healthy enough to try and go back to my normal routine.

My shift manager texted me every other week asking when I’d be ready to go back on the schedule, and I always told her that I was still too sick to go in. Three days ago, I texted her and let her know that I was finally ready to go back in.... no response. Nothing. I even texted her again and still. Nothing.

I’m starting to think that I’m somehow being fired via ghosting.... for having the coronavirus. Is this legal? Is there anything I can do about this? I’ve worked at this restaurant for 5 years and being fired this way just seems completely unacceptable. What is my next move?"
Are museum jobs dead for the foreseeable future?,"Been a museum/zoo educator my entire adult life.  With Covid-19, many of my friends in the same field across the country have been laid off.  We're in this business not for the money, but because we're passionate about what we do.  Still we have to pay the bills.  Is this the time to put that passion aside and find something new, or do you think museums/camps/zoos will bounce back in some way?"
Vicious cycle in HR/Recruiter/Talent Acquisition jobs - my first post,"Hi guys, I have about two years of Recruitment/Talent Acquisition experience. I was laid off of my position due to COVID-19. Initially I was networking with Recruiters and hiring managers on LinkedIn and applying on Indeed. I had a few referrals, but those companies don’t have Recruiter/Talent Acquisition jobs available. With most companies on a hiring freeze, Recruiters and TA roles were first to go. Lots of companies aren’t ready to begin hiring back employees, so there are very few positions to apply to. 

Not sure what to try differently. I’m in Colorado. Being new to the industry, I don’t have a ton of friends/connections either.  

It’s hard to get back into HR once you leave, so I really don’t want to take a position outside of it. Besides, it’s what I’m passionate about. Is this just something I’ll have to wait out?"
"Corporate office making all employees return soon, despite going against state guidelines","I work for a company in the Philly metro, which is practically Pennsylvania's hotspot for the Coronavirus. Our current guidelines state that offices can reopen, but telework must resume where feasible. My company has been remote since March and telework has been 100% feasible. All directors and managers agree that telework has been a success considering that projects have been completed properly and on time. Our performance metrics are very stable, despite everyone working from home.

However, the director of our corporate office very much hates working from home, and it seems that him and leadership have made the decision to make us return to work without getting any input from employees. We are returning very soon.

My corporate office is a very old building with tight hallways, poor ventilation, cramped cubicle spaces and tiny meeting rooms. It will be impossible to social distance. IMPOSSIBLE. If there's any office that's a recipe to spread the virus indoors, it's 100% mines. I have no idea how they can enforce social distancing.

I have asthma and parents that are at high risk. My parents could easily get killed by the virus, and I'm afraid of being around co-workers in our crappy, poorly ventilated office building.

All of this is happening on top of my company forcing every employee to take 12 days of PTO this summer (and they DID NOT state a reason why). This is a for profit healthcare company.

Is anyone else in a similar position with their company as well? I am very upset that I have to deal with these issues."
Turning down interviews in the time of Covid-19.,"I lost my previous position because of Covid-19. I'm 1.5 weeks into my job search and I have three interviews thus far out of 36 applications. 

After an HR interview, I determined it's a bad fit. The work isn't interesting, I'd be forced to be at the office for weird hours to try to sync with the Pacific Time Zone despite being in Eastern, and I'd be in an office for no reason since I would not be interacting with anyone there (I asked).

I'm scared to turn it down because well....Covid-19 is making UX jobs harder to get and I'm scared for the second wave making things worse. I plan on working wherever my next role is for two years, which would mean that the recession is likely over, I have enough experience for most UX jobs (4 years plus a master's is enough to get most senior roles), and I could go anywhere I want. 

I am fully aware I might have to suffer for two years, particularly in a location I don't want to be in or a job with boring work. 

My finances are fine; I am moving back with parents and unemployment covers my monthly bills. I am not drawing unemployment yet and the mandate that you have to take the first job offered does not begin until July 31st unless a new bill is passed.

Would I be stupid to turn down interviews based on HR interviews during this time?"
Looking at a career change from freelancing and want to know if there are very flexible positions that afford a similar feel to freelancing.,"I've been working in the music and musical theatre field since I was 18, I'm 29 now. Since COVID, music and live performances are drowning and I would like to find something else to do. I have a lot of skills, created a LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter profile and have been applying to what ever I can. 

I am a freelancer and entrepreneur at heart and I really don't want to give up that flexible schedule. I like flex schedules and essentially want to find a job that doesn't put hourly as priority. I want something that puts tasks as a priority first so I can accomplish what needs to get done without the pressure of having to arrive somewhere for a 9-5 job. I know some exist but I am wondering if there are jobs and companies that do solely this where they don't label the positions as ""40-hours per week"". 

Maybe I'm being too nit-picky but I really want to build my own thing. Any insight or experience in this stuff would be great!"
How to get back job offer taken away by COVID-19?,"Looking for some advice for my partner in how to secure (or resecure I guess) a job.

Prior to COVID-19, my partner applied for an amazing job with a multinational company that was a significant promotion from her current title and a key step in her career goals.
Following the interview, they decided to call her no longer that 1 hour later to say that she was a perfect applicant and they would even increase the salary by several grand per year over the listed remuneration on the ad.
Obviously she was ecstatic about this offer and accepted almost immediately and was due to start in roughly 3 weeks time and completed the required pre-employment medical that week.
Whilst waiting for the results of the medical to reach their hr team, covid came along and changed everything. The company overnight enacted a total hiring freeze. Her medical came back flawless and a contract was written and was meant to be getting mailed to her that day, but ultimately due to the new policies this role was no longer available.
The role was never formally rescinded and the hiring manager continued to assure her that they were working on it for over a week before all contact was dropped.

A month or 2 has passed now, and given job uncertainty in the near future we would love to try and find out if this role is still available and ultimately if they'd still be interested in hiring her.

So herein lies the questions,
How would you approach the company to find out if the job offer is still available? What would you even say? 
Would it still be acceptable to ask for the same offered salary particularly given the current climate?"
Making a good impression as a new hire in the time of Covid-19?,"I start a new job on Friday.  The last time I was a new-hire anywhere was 2012.

I have anxiety so I like to go into situations with a battle plan.  At the risk of sounding like Patrick Bateman, my battle plan for coming into a new job previously included:  


* Smiling easily and often
* Firm handshakes when first meeting people, with eye contact
* Asking coworkers/managers out to lunch to get to know them better/try to gain trust faster

All of these are impossible right now aside from eye contact, as I don't want to be touching new people, smiles will be covered by my mask, and I can't take people to lunch as restaurants are closed for dine in & employees are encouraged to eat alone when in the building, so as not to spread the virus (masks are off while eating).

Maybe I'm overthinking things, but I'm worried about coming off as cold or standoffish when I go in to meet my new manager on Friday.  This particular job is a field position that has very little face-to-face interaction after training, so I'm worried a poor first impression will be the only thing she remembers about me for years to come.  How the heck do I stand out when they won't even be able to see my face??"
"Working remotely, can I move without telling my boss?","I am a contingent worker (hired through a staffing company) at a tech company in Silicon Valley. I’ve been there for 1.5 years, with my next 6 month contract extension coming up in August. I was planning on finding a new job and moving to Texas after finishing my master’s degree in May, but with everything going on there aren’t a ton of openings. If my contract is not extended I will move (to be local when applying for new roles) as I have sufficient savings to be comfortable doing so, but in the case I keep my current role, it is appealing to continue making a Silicon Valley salary in Texas (at least until they need me to return to the office). If I am extended (which is my expectation), my boss has made it clear that our team should expect to continue working from home at least through the end of 2020. The way things are going we haven’t had anyone return to the office yet, so I expect longer. Could I move and not tell my manager? How bad of an idea is this?"
Does anyone feel like the COVID-19 pandemic has set their careers back?,"Does anyone feel like the COVID-19 pandemic has set their careers back? 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure how to feel about this virus. I didn't lose my job thankfully, but most of my friends and family did. I was working towards a promotion and would have made a year prior to the state of affairs, but now with the grim reality that my job has received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, I'm almost certain that my promotion is slipping away, as they can barely stay afloat. 

&#x200B;

While I am very grateful that I have a job still, my family does not, so I am the breadwinner in my household at the moment. It's a very scary feeling. I'm on all forms of government assistance, my housing complex provides food to low-income residents, and I'm applying to every form of monetary help I can. It all just seems so grim. 

All of my colleagues are able to find new jobs, with better pay, or higher job titles and all of the work I've done in my job so far seems trivial. All of the individuals with whom I've spoken to in passing, at the laundromat, at the coffee shop, front-desk receptionists, all seem so happy. 

&#x200B;

How can anyone be happy? I feel COVID-19 has ruined my chances at a real future. At a way to move up the corporate ladder. As a way to make a sustainable living. I'm a couple of years out of college, and as a millennial, had to deal with the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial housing crisis, 9/11, and now this.   


Can I just not get a break? It almost just seems like it's not worth trying anymore. Even individuals on unemployment are receiving more then I am. 

Sorry for the rant, I just feel so helpless and hopeless and like my life is worthless and not going to be the same after this."
"To those who have returned the office, what’s it been like?","My job is letting us continue to work remotely until the 4th of July, today they came out with their return to the office plan which basically amounts to “We’re gonna clean the office a little more, but beyond that take precautions and use your best judgement”. Of course, if you have any concerns about returning to the office, you’re free to speak to your boss about it and be singled out and pressured to be a team player. Has anyone else’s employer actually put in the effort to protect their employees, or is being thrown in to swim with the sharks like my job is doing a more typical experience?"
Worried I won’t be able to find a good enough paying job,"I was permanently laid off from my job in mid March at a nightclub on the Las Vegas strip. The club was slated to close March 28 pandemic or not but Covid sped that up to March 15

Leading up to the shutdown, I had 2 jobs lined up. The hotel that housed my nightclub was going to absorb me as one of their employees. I received an email a month ago saying that job has been canceled and they won’t be bringing me on

The other, I was hired, passed background and drug tests with flying colors but orientation was canceled thanks to the shutdowns. After a week of phone calls and emails that got me nowhere I finally was able to visit their employment center (another strip hotel) and I was told I’m not “officially hired until orientation is completed” meanwhile, the manager who interviewed and hired me gave me a call during the shutdown and told me I’d still have a job once they reopened. But I haven’t gotten called yet. The guy at the employment center told me to wait 2 weeks as they’re still getting everything organized and deciding what new hires to bring on and who isn’t. 

Being as this job is as a food server at the pool, the job would have been seasonal anyways and I probably wouldn’t start until July which would only give me 3-4 months worth of work. So I’m doubtful they’ll bring me on

I’m getting more and more anxious as time goes on. I’ve had 2 interviews at 2 off strip bars but nothing looks promising as of yet. 

Prior to moving to Las Vegas all my work experience was in retail, I never made more than $20k a year until I moved here. I made almost $60k in 2019....If I were to take one of those jobs it wouldn’t earn me enough to keep up on a $500 car payment and $1000 a month rent plus everything else, even if I worked 40 hours a week

I’m afraid that I may be forced to take one of those retail jobs once unemployment runs out and eventually fall behind on my finances and lose everything. It keeps me up at night 

If there’s anyone else in my situation how are you dealing with it?"
Accepted a job offer over email before COVID. Should I look for other jobs now?,"So after months of searching, I finally got accepted for what was hopefully going to be the start of a lucrative career. Then COVID happened.

I accepted the job and was given a start date and everything but luckily before I gave in my notice I asked if they still wanted me and they said they were thankful I hadn't done anything yet. We agreed over the phone to postpone my start date until things calmed down (this was 2 weeks before our lockdown in the UK).

I've spoken to my would-be manager twice since then over LinkedIn, mostly just seeing how we're doing on each side etc. The problem is that their company is in 2 sectors which never do well in recessions, and have been hit particularly hard during COVID. As far as I can tell, they're doing okay though (nothing in the news about their collapse and linkedin etc seems to be BAU).

I haven't asked directly about when they're planning on having me back as the manager said that they're just surviving the next few weeks/months for now.

Based on the info I've given here, does it sound likely I'm still going to have a future at that company? More importantly though, is it worth me just applying for other companies? I hate my job and the moment and I feel trapped, but I don't want to awkwardly/directly ask if they still have the position for me at the job I was already accepted for."
Got laid off. Should I stay in a smaller role?,"I was the assistant manager at an espresso bar inside of a high end clothing/department store. My position just got eliminated and I was laid off by corporate. But I have the option to transfer to a barista position. 

Cons: it’s less pay. Id be going from salaried to hourly. I’d be at the same level as people I was managing a few days ago. I would make more money on unemployment and have at least two months to find a new job before that runs out. General concerns about covid and being around people in a public area. 

Pros: job security. Having to find a new job is stressful and especially on covid times. I really like everyone I work with

I am afraid to go back because of my mothers immune system and the nature of my work has me talking to people and interacting with them all day. 

Here’s the issue I want to tell my job I can’t go back however my boss has made it sound like I need to go back. I want to call HR and tell them my situation, I just don’t know how to go about it.

“Forced”? To use PTO,"I’m posting this on behalf of my Fiancé and was just wondering if anyone else has dealt with it, and if so, what did you do?
She works at a warehouse, and due to Covid-19 her job has less and less orders every week. In March, a tornado came and destroyed the building and they got paid time off for about a week, then they had to relocate to a different state. It was okay, they got paid time and a half the entire time they were there which was about 2 months. They also got “compensated” for an extra week of PTO (40 hours). 
So in May they returned to their warehouse which is here in Tennessee but they’ve had almost no orders so for the past roughly a month, her entire team at work has been getting sent home early (after only working 4 hours, sometimes less than that) every day and sometimes they don’t even let them come in. Because of this, she’s either forced to use PTO or go without pay, which is crazy bc then she’d bring home about $250 a week compared to her normal amount of almost $600. 
Now it’s the middle of June and she’s almost through all of her PTO, leaving her with nothing left for the rest of this year and it isn’t even her fault considering she never misses work except for emergencies, but now she’s having to every single day. 
Just curious if anyone else has dealt with this as well. 

Also, unemployment isn’t an option because she still makes more than what they would offer her so she won’t get approved."

All advice is welcome and I thank you for taking the time to read this."
"Have an in person interview tomorrow, masks are required. What type of mask is appropriate?","A little back story, had an interview with a small fragrance company back in Februar. They wanted to bring me in for a  second interview in March but was canceled because of COVID. Been in contact with them through out and have stated they are still interested in bringing me in, well I finally got the call for my second interview set up for tomorrow morning. 

Since it's in person they are requiring mask, my question I only have a cloth mask with print on it marvel comics characters on it. Is that appropriate for the interview?"
"I should feel lucky to have a job during COVID19, but the toxic environment at work is making my depression worse.","After being with the company for almost a year I realized I’m extremely depressed at work.

Employees have quit due to the clear favoritism and nepotism within our department. Other employees have been fired or laid off. In total 4 employees are gone which is half of our team. I’m expected to take on all of their work plus cover for other positions if they are out of office. My boss always seems to find a scapegoat who is constantly met with aggressive emails about their work performance. Non essential low level employees who have desk jobs are still expected to come in during stay at home orders.

I’ve expressed my concerns multiple times and was told to keep my head down. Everyday I wake up with my severe depression worsening because of my job. Im unable to take care of myself. What should I do? There’s hiring freezes almost everywhere resulting in me being too scared to quit."
Remote working after Covid-19,"Has anyone found any good analysis or opinions on the working environment post Covid-19? Otherwise can we have a discussion here about what companies are choosing to do? 

We are still working from home through September. At that time they will reassess. I believe it may be possible that we will have the option to permanently work from home as it appears to be working out well. 

A question I have is that, in the permanent work from home situation, does it mean that we should become geographically free to move about the country, in general? Do we expect to see more remote employees?"
"Masters or Job: How do you tell you manager at your new job ""I'll leave as soon as on-campus classes start""? I haven't even started the job. But I want to leave on good terms.","I have always wanted to do Masters from Germany. I was working at my home country, it was a new job and I started to hate it because of the toxic environment. So when I got my student visa I gave a two weeks notice and left the job. The main reason was not the masters, it was the toxicity. My manager was pain in the ass. Anyways, I received an email from the university that they'll conduct the classes online because of corona, this happened just a day before I was supposed to fly. They also said that they classes have been postponed. 
This hit me pretty hard. It's seemed as though all my dreams had been put on pause for an indefinite period of time. Since my graduation (Bachelor's) I have had a job. I didn't know how to cope with this ""free time"". So I applied for a few jobs. I was also unsure if I want to pursue master's online, because it won't be the same as on-campus. And I applied for jobs that suited my skillsets, aligned with my career goals. I applied mostly at small companies, and only at one multi-national which is also the among the biggest corp in my home country. 

I had been a while, since this happened, and I had to decide whether or not to take online classes, so I availed the option and started my classes. It's been 2.5 months that I've been studying.
So the most unexpected thing happened. I got an interview call from that big company, and I got so excited, I went for the interview. It went well, then the final interview, and finally I landed the job! I couldn't believe it. I landed it so easily. Now they want me to join them, and this just seemed very foolish of me to pass the opportunity like that. I took my time to think about it and accepted the offer. But I'm still not sure, I haven't signed the contract yet. I've only accepted it verbally. 

I had my exams in July, but they've been postponed, the university says they next semester will probably be online as well. But it's not confirmed as of yet and they'll see how things evolve. Which makes sense. 

All of this uncertainty, made me accept the offer. But it really stresses me out when I think about leaving the job in a few months. ""What if the university calls on campus for exams?"" ""What if the next semester is on-campus?"" I know leaving a company in a few months does not leave a good impression and ruins the employee's reputation. 

I don't know what to do. Though writing this post has cleared my mind to some extend like I don't think joining was a stupid decision. But I want to tell my manager so that when I leave it doesn't come as a shock to him. But since it's a big company idk how soon a ""new"" ""entry-level"" employee should give out that information because that could really work out against me. But again, I don't want to drop a truth bomb, and just come up to them one day with the news that I'm leaving. 

I'm really enjoying studying. And I DO NOT want to put my masters on hold for this job. Legally, I can do both as long as I'm staying in my home country. 

In the interview, they didn't ask me anything regarding my future plans, expected duration of anything like that. They don't even know I'm doing master's.

I was thinking was casually dropping little info so they at least know about my master's. Instead of having a one-to-one serious meeting. 

This whole thing has been extremely stressful. I don't like disappointing people. And I want to leave as soon the classes start on campus. Masters is my first priority.

How and when should I tell my manager? What details should I give? 

Note: The salary package is amazing.
But I having completed my masters from Germany, I know I can land better jobs at better companies."
Job description change,"I need another opinion. I have a bachelor's degree and 4 years of office experience. I'm good at my job as an admin assistant. Staff was reduced due to COVID19 and I found out the reception will not be coming back. I will now be given those job duties that include cleaning the office completely bathrooms floors and all. I will also most likely lose my office to sit up front.

Losing my office sucks, but I worked hard to not have to have jobs that include janitorial work. 

Do I keep my mouth shut and do it? Or do I risk losing my job and tell how I feel about it?

It took me 2.5 years to find this job. It pays more than my last and had benefits such as health insurance that my last job didn't have.
I've been at this current job sense January. My boss told me she will be rewriting my job description for me to sign."
COVID-19 Interview questions?,"Got set for doing a phone interview on Tuesday, and I'm just feeling a bit rusty after a few months but would anyone know what kind of COVID-19 questions that they would ask and how to do you answer them? (the job I'm interviewing for is a dental receptionist)"
Offered job (written) in March. Still no start date and I haven't really been updated since. Is it time to give up?,"Like the title says I was offered a job back in March, right before everything went downhill.

My training was scheduled April 1st, and I received a voicemail the weekend before saying it had been postponed. At the time I wasn't surprised and told them I understood, etc. 

But now, my status has hardly been updated since then. I've tried emailing the HR head, no one ever got back to me. I managed to get in touch with the receptionist a week ago and she said there was a hiring freeze and to hang tight, but at this point I'm losing hope.

I know I shouldn't be this attached to a job, but considering what is going on right now I'm really hoping this job comes around. What should I do? This is extremely frustrating because this wasn't just a second interview, I signed all of the paperwork, did the drug test and the whole nine yards. My state is entering phase 2 on Friday, should I call Monday or just send (yet another) email to the HR head? Or should I just give up entirely?"
Is this a bad time to take a new job offer?,"A few days ago, I was contacted by a recruiter for a position that I had applied for a year ago. I'm struggling with deciding how seriously I should consider changing jobs with all of the economy and virus stuff going on. 

I (accidentally but successfully) negotiated the wage for the position up to $16 per hour on the initial call. I currently make $12.95 with a 10% shift differential most of the time for about $14.20 an hour on average. The pros beyond pay are that the new job would be very similar to my current one, but less stress with a more relaxed atmosphere. The new job would also be day hours instead of my current graveyard shift. Plus, my current job has no possibility of wage or position growth for me, unlike the new job. 

On the con side, the new job would be about 15 minutes further away than my current job. I have a reliable, efficient car though. Also, the new job may have slightly less job security in the face of coronavirus as I'm currently working on a federal subcontract. The big con is that in my industry, a term contract with possibility of hire at the end is standard, so the offer is 5 months with ""strong possibility of hire"". Usually that wouldn't bother me at all as I've been hired this way several times, but again we're in some weird times.

So, would you consider this job right now? If not, how can I handle this so that they consider me in the future if I apply later?"

"Working remotely due to pandemic, should I tell my boss I took a trip to another state?","So since the pandemic started my entire company has been working from home. Since there’s no date on when we would return to work, I’ve taken a trip to another state to spend some time with my family. Although there is a time difference, I work the same hours to match my company work hours. I haven’t told my boss about my trip as it doesn’t affect my work and since we’re all remote and I’m working the same hours, I don’t think it matters. I do intend on traveling back home as soon as we have a concrete date to return to office.


Thing is, he recently  ordered a new work laptop for me and suggested maybe meeting up for coffee while I go pick up the laptop. 

So my question is should I just tell him I’m currently in another state? Would that be awkward since I’m only mentioning it now after he suggested coffee? Or should I not tell him and find excuses to not get coffee and delay my new laptop pickup. Advice appreciated. Thank you.

UPDATE: Thank you all for the comments and advice. Decided to tell my boss this morning. He was super understanding and made no big deal of it. Just wanted to make sure of the date I would return."
Can I be a contact tracer for a different state?,"I'm a college student currently living in Nashville, TN, and I'm having trouble finding job applications for contact tracers in my area. I only found one application, and I want to have a remote backup plan in case that application doesn't work out for me.

As I continued my contract tracer job search, I noticed that there were plenty of openings in Kentucky. Some of these openings would pay me more than the one I applied for in Nashville. I was thinking about applying for a job in Kentucky, but since I don't live in Kentucky and don't want to break any rules, I thought I'd take my question to the internet to answer. Is it okay for me to apply for a fully-remote contract tracing job in another state?"

Would this be a good time to relocate for a new job?," 

Hey guys! So ever since I graduated college, I've wanted to move to a state that has plenty of nature, cooler climate, and outdoor activities. I am big into hiking, climbing and all that jazz. Living out here in Houston, I feel like I get none of that. So for the past 4 years, I have been working really hard in my current company (i work in finance). I have pretty much mastered SQL and a bunch of other analytic tools that seem to make me standout in my field. I took a stab at applying to a few companies out of state and it seems to be working. I have been getting interviews and even got to 3rd round with one company before turning it down due to salary (salary not being on par with the cost of living in that city). So that got me thinking, would this be a good time to relocate? I am pretty comfortable in my current role and I love my co-workers. I make a decent amount and I am living comfortably. However, I don't see myself long term in this company and I have lived in Houston most of my life. I am kind of tired of driving down same street I grew up on and honestly, I just want change. But in current climate, I still haven't found a company I really want to work for, in a state I want. It's probably due to COVID forcing companies to freeze hiring. Even then, would it be smart to relocate for a new company right now? There are talks of a second wave of Covid hitting in fall and with 2020 being already rocky; I am afraid that I might get furloughed once I relocate. So there is already an underlying risk on top of all the stuff that comes with a new company/relocation. What would be your opinion on this?

TL;DR: I want to move out of state. But I'm scared that companies hiring right now might start furloughing employees if a second wave of covid hits. And I would be in a new state with no job...."
Just Got Laid Off Over The Phone,"Hey r/jobs,

&#x200B;

Quick question. Long story short,

* Got furloughed from the company Late March, immediately applied for UI
* Got a call from my boss that my position is being eliminated yesterday

 I haven't gotten any documentation due to being laid off indefinitely (basically fired). Now she wants me to return my things. Should I do it or wait until I get the documentation? I'm just afraid I may get framed as resigning. 

I still need to collect UI until I figure something out.

Thanks!"
"Uncertain if I should pivot, change careers, or just keep applying like mad?","I've been actively looking for another job since December 2019. I do IT and database management but ideally I'd really prefer to pivot doing IT. Another option would be to take up paralegal work or some kind of legal assisting since I worked in legal recruiting. In February, I almost obtained a position with a not-for-profit here in my city managing their donor database but that went belly up due to COVID19 and had to scrap the position.

In March my current employer docked our pay across the board by a quarter. Last week, they made an announcement that they might have to lay off some people. Although there is a possibility that I'll stay on, I feel that they kind of drew a line in the sand by docking pay but not forcing managing directors to retire. In the meantime, I've got my boomer parents telling me to ""just go back to school and get another degree."" Probably not the best thing for someone who is 35, divorced, and with two kids.

Does anyone have any advice? I've been applying like mad and I'm at my wits end."
Returned check.,"Returned check from job because bank account has been closed because of negative balance and because it was inactive. I was unable to work during the time it happened because of COVID. 

What should I ask my job? Will take a little bit of time? How long? 

I’ve never experienced this and I’m young so I don’t know what to do."
How to go about contacting employers after a hiring freeze?,"I was laid off at the very beginning of March, about a week before everything officially shut down. I was very lucky and snuck in about 5 interviews right before our governor called for an immediate closure of the types of businesses (hospitality) I was interviewing at. One of these positions was particularly attractive to me, and I never heard back. This is understandable since I was told the day of the interview “Well get back to you by next week” and by next week they were forced to close. 

I recently received a marketing email from that company that they will be reopening in the beginning of June. I wouldn’t be surprised if the position was cancelled, but was wondering if now would be a good time to reach out to the interviewer on the status of the position. Would this be professional and if so what’s the best way to go about it?"
Which industries do you think will grow & thrive post COVID-19?,"I'm a grad student in the humanities and coronavirus will probably shut down a lot of schools & kill the academic job market (which was already dying). But I'm curious to know what y'all think about the future jobs that will be affected (in particular, positively) by COVID-19.

We all know things like Zoom and video conferencing will be around for a while. Obviously, the medical industry is always a safe bet, too.

But what other industries do you think will grow once the coronavirus dust settles?"
Coronavirus affecting (data science) job offer," 

I was offered a consultant role at EXL Services India. I submitted all the relevant forms for verification already. And I was supposed to join in June. And the coronavirus delayed my degree completion and the company was accommodative saying that I could join in July/August. I got a mail yesterday saying that my offer is postponed till Q1 of 2021, which, in the worst-case scenario, is gonna be June of 2021.

My doubt is if the company will be honouring my job offer or not. Also, should I be on the lookout for other jobs, since a gap of 1 year before starting my first job would be detrimental to my CV?"
My job is starting to invite people back and many people are mad about it,"My job has about 200 employees with around 50 of them being Full Time and 150 of them Part Time. We have all been out of work since mid-March but full timer’s have been getting paid while part timer’s stopped being paid at the beginning of May. 

Today my job announced that full time employees will be coming back to work next week. Part timers will continue to be laid off and called back one by one as business needs allow. I’m a part timer so this is disappointing to me. 

The large majority of the full time employees are pissed off that they have to return to work. Many of them saying things like, “The best part about returning will be getting an early release and leaving” or “They might as well kill me than have me work again”. For them, they have been getting paid for doing 0 work and now actually have to work for their paycheck. 

In the opposite situation, us part timer’s are dying to go back as many of us enjoyed our job and will appreciate having a paycheck again. I was due for a promotion literally the day after we were sent home indefinitely and now have no idea if that promotion is in the works for me. It’s honestly frustrating to see so many people wish to work while those who have the opportunity to, make it seem like the worst day of their lives."
should i wait for my company to call me back???,"so i work at call center company, at april the HR make me take unpaid leave and promising after the wuhan virus problem conclude they will take me back, it been a month i still keep communicate with them but they haven't give an ok, honestly i love this job they pay like twice from my previous job and it less stressful.

Spent 14 years of my life to become a Physician Assistant and now I'm expected to clean bathrooms at the office. What should I do?,"FYI, I am posting on behalf of my fiance since she doesn't use reddit. I do not want to be too specific. But she works at a major hospital in the states with 4 hospital buildings and a lot of small specialist. She is currently working in a selective surgery field and works in a practice with another pa, 4 doctors, and a few medical assistants and receptionists. They have put the 2 PAs on a rotation with the rest of the office (except the doctors) to clean the office bathrooms more regularly since they will start seeing patients in office for the first time since covid started. They have janitors , but need to wipe it down frequently and for some reason the office manager thought it would be a good idea to make a rotation.  

I just want to say that there is nothing wrong with cleaning bathrooms or janitorial work at all. We both believe no one in that office should be cleaning the bathrooms except for the cleaning staff. She is not working at a small practice and the actual office is located in a large 4 story building all owned by the hospital. They bring millions in every month ekth the surgeries. I was surprised when she told me earlier today and I couldn't believe it. Do they expect her to take off her white coat and start wiping down the bathroom? How is this even safe? When someone is a janitor, they are not expected to exam patients with the same clothes they just cleaned the bathroom in. Just so you know her scope, she does everything the doctors do. She will see a patient pre-op, post-op, help with surgery , and is the main care taker when following the patient long term (up to a few years post op depending on the patient) 

What should her next move be? I told her not to quit especially now and there is no way they can fire her for refusing to clean bathrooms. Would that even be legally possible? 

(Sorry for the typos, English isn't my 1st language)"
Furlough Situation.,"Quick question for you folks. I hope everyone is well. 

Furlough may be the way forward for my organisation and they are basing it on ""utilisation"" statistics. 

Although I am highly paid and qualified, My work is very efficient and I am notorious for it. The Company has invested heavily in me over the last few years. Due to this reason my utilisation statistics are pretty low in comparison to others ""less senior, less qualified"" and this is mainly down to the time taken to complete a task for example. 

Ultimately it's the Companies decision and If I need to find another job, So be It. 

My question: Is this a justifiable means of furloughing people or even judging someone's performance based on this metric alone ? 

Interested to hear what opinions you have to offer. 

Thank you!"
Anxiety/depression and returning to work after COVID lay-off,"Need advice on dealing with my mental health and my job

Here is a little background on my situation. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, have been on meds since. Throughout this time, I’ve always had a full time job, although in the last 2 years, switched around a few times to different companies (all in the retail sector).

Before covid, I was having a really hard time at my workplace. It was a very toxic environment and I was looking for new opportunities, working with a psychotherapist to manage my anxiety and issues, and making a little bit of progress. 

Then covid arrived, and I was temporarily laid off for the past 8 weeks. I applied for gov assistance (I live in Canada and it’s very helpful!). Within the first few weeks, I immediately noticed I was the happiest i had been in months, and working with my psychotherapist, attributed this to not being in the toxic work environment everyday. 

Fast forward to Friday of last week when I got the heads up that I’ll be going back to work this week. I have had the worst, most depressed, anxious weekend. I’ve had two panic attacks, crying/sobbing fits and my mind has been in another place, I can barely enjoy or think about anything else. 

There’s two main concerns of mine: one of course is going back to work during covid, nervous about the precautions and changes we need to make, my health and safety etc. But the other is going back into the environment that made me so miserable just a few months ago. I had issues prior to covid, but I feel as though the will be masked into just being “covid anxiety”. 

I can’t quit my job- 1. I need the financial support and 2. I do not want my mental health to result in me losing my job. I have been looking into short term disability leave, but again, I feel like they will assume I just have covid anxiety and it will be a fight to “prove” I had issues before this. 

If you guys have advice on how I should go about my situation, I would really appreciate it! Having crippling anxiety is the worst thing, I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy. I am supposed to return tomorrow (Wednesday) so any suggestions will be really helpful! 

Also thanks for reading this long post :)"
Job not Taking COVID-19 Seriously,"I’m a college student working part time at a local fast food place.  I’ve only been working three weeks but have been becoming increasingly concerned about my COVID risk.  My county has some, but not a ton, of reported cases.

My coworkers do not believe that coronavirus is “real”.  They believe pretty much every conspiracy theory about it.  There is no social distancing inside the store (it wouldn’t be possible), and those not directly handling customers don’t wear masks.  From the conversations I hear my coworkers have, they have been living “normally” outside of work, not wearing masks, going shopping whenever they want, visiting other peoples houses.

The most concern I have is from a coworker that called off sick with a fever today.  I asked a manager about if that employee would be allowed to return to work within two weeks.  I was given a non-answer about how that employee calls off sick whenever she doesn’t want to come in, and “it’s probably not covid”.  I’m scheduled to work with this employee in a few days.  She refuses to wear a mask even when interacting with customers.  Additionally, I found out today that the health department has been calling our store because customers are reporting that not all employees are wearing masks (which is true).

I don’t know what to do.  I live with someone 65+, and my family takes care of another vulnerable person.  My current game-plan is to go to work when scheduled, see if the (sick?) employee is there, and talk to our head manager regardless.  I’m worried that sharing my concern with a bunch of coronavirus “truthers” could cause me to lose my job.  I don’t desperately need it, but my mother is forcing me to work (despite her being aware there is a pandemic and working from home herself)."
No Written Offer yet but it's a pandemic. Should I be worried?,"I'm a new grad. An start-up that I interned for last year has verbally offered me a temporary contractor position, which, as of the last time we spoke, was still being worked out. I've sent in my updated resume to be passed on to HR, I've been talking to the person who verbally offered me the position, but the last thing I heard about it was almost two weeks ago. I know the economy is crazy right now with this pandemic, but I really want to lockdown a timeline for this job. How much longer should I wait to follow up about it again?"
Rude hiring process?,"I had 3 interviews with a great position in my dream field, and then flew out to meet everyone at the company - before the pandemic.  When I flew out, I was told the decision was between me and someone else, and the decision would be made before the end of the week.  Unfortunately, that was the week everything shut down, and the company emailed me telling me they would need some extra time because they had their plates full with covid-stuff.  Completely understandable.  Three weeks later they got back to me and said they were freezing their hiring process for the time being due to things being crazy, but would be in touch once everything started to settle down.  I responded that I was still very interested in the position, and asked if they knew which direction they wanted to go (I just graduated college, and needed to know whether to move back home to wait for the position or sign a new lease on my apt.)  They never responded to that question.  Now, about 4-5 weeks later, they called and said that things are looking clearer, and they would like to make me an offer.  I did not think this was a big deal, but a lot of my friends and family have been telling me that this behavior was incredibly rude, and they have strung me along.  With the virus impacting pretty much everything, I’m not sure if they were being rude or just incredibly busy.  I’m pretty new to the career-world so is this rude or acceptable?  Is it a red flag that they didn’t let me know they were looking to hire me specifically after things opened back up?"
Paid Internship Tips,"Apologies in advance for the WC, but I’m a rising junior at UIUC pursuing a dual degree in Accounting & Supply Chain Management. After 4 semesters of school I’ve already completed 89/150 credit hours for my two degrees, I’ve worked creating/selling custom apparel, as a brand ambassador, as a server in a restaurant, and I am the President of a consulting club and have worked with large clients such as the former St. Louis BattleHawks of the XFL. I already have a 2021 internship lined up with KPMG but if I don’t get something this summer then it’s going to be especially difficult for me to afford living expenses for next year. 

I had an internship lined up for this summer but it has been rescinded due to covid-19. I currently have 37 applications pending for various paid internship from finance to sales to accounting to supply chain/operations but I haven’t heard anything back yet. I’ve gone through the hundreds of jobs in Handshake, Illinois Job Link, and Angel List and have applied to everything that I felt I would be remotely qualified for/could learn quickly. 

I live near Chicago so there should be at least something available, right? What are some tips for trying to find a paid internship this summer? Should I go through more job boards? 

I’m beginning to feel pretty hopeless about this search and I really don’t know what to do since restaurants in Illinois will be closed for at least another month and my local grocery stores are not currently hiring. 

I’ve failed a lot before but it’s always been for a reason or something that I could learn from. If I can’t get a paid job this summer then it feels like I failed for no reason and that’s a terrifying thought"
Tips for being Trapped for the Pandemic,"I want to start by saying: relatively speaking, I'm unbelievably fortunate to have a job given everything that's happening. A healthy majority of my friends have lost their jobs, and I know that I'm lucky to have not. This all said...

Before the pandemic, I'd started looking for a new job. My current job had been stagnant, with no room for growth, and it not being in my industry. Then the pandemic happened. For the first month I couldn't do work, because there were so many unknowns. But, over the past month, I've been doing basically two months worth of work, in much less time. The ability to turn down additional assignments or ask to only have meetings to be between 9 and 5 has gone away, with most higher-ups believing I have nothing better to do.  Yesterday I was in a meeting unrelated to my job, but wasn't allowed to leave as I 'surely had nothing but free time on my hands.' Last week, I spent an hour on a video call watching my boss plan a different meeting, and I was kept on the call in case he had questions.

The combination of an overbearing amount of work, the complete disregard for my time and personal life, and the inability to affect any change in my role has really started to take a toll on my mental health. Normally, these would be red flags for a person to leave, but with the job market dried up for quite some time... and I'm feeling incredibly trapped in my job,

Again, I know I'm fortunate (when discussing with friends/family, I've been described as being ""on the negative side of very lucky""), even compared to some co-workers. But spending 60 hours a week working a job that is ruining my mental health, while in a situation that's already mentally taxing...

I'm looking to see if anybody has any tips, thoughts, or suggestions on how to improve (or at least, make bearable) my situation."
Jobs worth the training during quarantine,"I'm fortunate enough to still be getting paycheck likely at least into the next 12 months. I currently am entertaining any and all areas of potential opportunities to prepare for the future for my family. No one can predict the future but I figure at the very least I can use my free time wisely for self improvement. I also am mindful that any potential stable career worth pursuing should ideally of interest to me. 

One such career as an example I thought of is real estate. Relatively low cost of entry and likely still going to be operational in the future. I fully understand this is a competitive industry though. Another area I've heard about is cyber security. 

So my questions are: 

What jobs or careers are worth pursuing in the future 

Whats are some jobs that someone can self study or at least read up on during this period of downtime?

Any information/suggestions are much appreciated."
Employer Forcing People Out - How to respond?,"
I work at a very small recruiting firm and was furloughed along with a few other coworkers due to Covid. A few weeks ago, because of the PPP loan, we were brought back. Since then leadership at my company seems to be doing everything they can to force people to quit, and this has escalated as we slowly transition back to the office this week. A few examples:
- If we are not “productive” enough or if we break any of the new procedures we will be sent home without pay for 14 days
- CEO outlined mask requirement in his plan but offline said he doesn’t care if we wear them or not. Also told us we are forcing ourselves back into the office because we failed at working from home
- I asked questions about the mask policy, what we’d do if someone becomes sick, etc. and received a link to the CDC as a response
- A coworker has an autoimmune disease and has been going into the office - they were asked if they’d prefer to just resign since that would be easier for the company 
- I asked to take PTO today instead of going into the office and was also asked the same question over the phone

Overall, I don’t know what to do. They’ve created a stressful, toxic environment that’s hard to deal with. I don’t want to get forced out but don’t know what to when it feels like they have all the power. At this point I’m just trying to wait til June when the funds will run out and they’ll probably lay me off. Until then, any advice? 

TL;DR - my employer is creating policies and procedures to force folks to quit so they won’t have to pay for unemployment or have to pay back the PPP loan."
Should I follow-up with the company (again) or let them reach out to me?,"So I had a job interview the second week of March. It was my personal best interview ever, and I got really good vibes from the people I interviewed with. The company had posted a handful of positions and were looking to get a few new hands on deck. 

Unfortunately, that was right before the COVID situation blew up here. I followed up at the end of March to check in, and they said that they were going to pause their hiring processes to transition their team to work from home and re-asses their client needs, but also said they would ""be in touch when they knew more"". They've also removed all their job postings from their website. Now that it's 1.5 months later and I still haven't heard back, I'm wondering if I should send an e-mail to let them know I'm still interested, or if I should just let them reach out to me when they're ready to do so (or if they've forgotten about me altogether)?

I've tried staying engaged with their posts on LinkedIn to keep my name in their mind, but who knows who runs their LI account. I want to appear interested - not as a pest or desperate, so if I do e-mail them, is there some kind of template that doesn't require a response back on their end?

Luckily I still have a job in all this, but I'm still hoping to keep moving forward with my career, and I'm still very excited about this company and opportunity. TIA!"
Had a message from my boss that I should 'keep my options open'!,"My boss messaged me earlier and I am worried that I am going to be without a job soon! I've only joined the company since the beginning of the year and I really like working there.

This is the message he sent.

""Morning - Sorry that HR haven't been in contact with you since the shutdown. You can appreciate that business has and is suffering as a result of the restrictions brought about by COVID virus. I understand from the owners of the business that cuts will he made and between you and me I would keep my options open. We are not back at work yet so by all means keep me posted of any further news. All the best.""

What do you lot make of this? Should I be worried?"
Following-Up On a Verbal Job Offer - Need Advice,"Back in March, I interviewed for a job and four days later they called and verbally offered me the job which I accepted. My start date at the time was TBD, because the day they offered me the job, they said they were temporarily closing their office and furloughing some of their administrative employees. About two days after this NJ (where I live and where this job is located) issued their stay at home order, which is still in effect.

I only heard from the manager responsible for hiring for this job once since then, and am planning on trying to reach out again. I just sent him an email and if I do not hear back I am going to call.

I was wondering how long after the email should I follow-up with a call if I haven't heard back from my email? Also, any other tips you can give over how to approach this would be greatly appreciated!"
"I was laid off due to COVID-19 on March 20th. Was told my position was eliminated. Today, I just found out that my previous job was listed online a week ago as “open” and is accepting applications.","What is the best approach here?

Previous employer hasn’t reached out to notify me the position is open.

It’s listed on 5 different employment websites, so definitely not a mistake posting.

Also a very specific job with a specific title. So I know it was my previous job."
Should I contact company who said I would be interviewed but they are reviewing the situation because of coronavirus (they emailed 1 month ago),"Hello,

I applied for a job in February. At the beginning of April, I received an email saying I was selected for interview but the position is being reviewed because of the coronavirus situation and they would be in touch. (I’m in the UK) 

I did not reply to this email at the time as I thought I would wait. I know they will get in contact when the situation is clearer - however, is it worth me emailing just to restate my interest - I’m worried that they may think I’m not interested still if I don’t email? They did say I could email if I would like more information.  I’m unsure about whether emailing will make me look good or whether to not bother them?

Thank you everyone."
Advice on how to quit a job I just started and that I work remotely?,"Because of COVID we're all working remotely.
I'm in my 3rd month at this company and I found that I'm really struggling with their processes and it's not a good fit for me.

I found another job that might be more my speed in terms of their processes.

How do I go about quitting? Do I schedule time with my boss and do it over Zoom? What do I say?"
I have a feeling my office might not take me back—does it sound like I need to job hunt?,"TDLR; does this situation sound like I’m about to be laid off? My boss has not confirmed I can return. 

I am a college student, and this was supposed to be my third summer working as a legal assistant on a seasonal basis. I am involved in some organizational projects at the office that they always need help keeping up with, but they are technically not urgent. 

During winter break, and spring break I come in when I can, and over the summer I work at least 3 full days a week (most of my coworkers only work 3 days as well because the three of them all happened to be Jehovah’s Witnesses, unlike my boss and I, and they had requested that). 

My office and boss are extremely kind to me and always assure me that they want me to come back the next time I’m home from school, including this year. Normally I just set things up with the paralegal via email because my boss has a hard time fitting in non-client calls. 

But this year, which unfortunately is my graduation year when I need to save, the paralegal told me that my boss would call me soon and to let her know if he needs to be reminded. She doesn’t seem to know what will happen and told me that she misses me (as normal) and to update her on what happened after he contacts me.

It’s been about 2-3 weeks of waiting for a call, and I already contacted her once to let her know, but she sent me back a similar message (let me know if you don’t get a call soon). I didn’t call myself because I know he wouldn’t want to be caught off guard; he likes to plan when he will have conversations.

- Should I assume that he is putting off telling me he can’t afford to have a non-essential team member back this summer? 

- Have lawyers/law firms taken a big hit lately?

- Should I assume that legal work has been extra intense due to COVID related issues and that he’s actually *busier* than usual? 

Thanks!"
Interviewing/job-seeking etiquette when furloughed,"I was furloughed at the end of March due to COVID-19 and my hours were reduced from 40 to 20 per week. I just started this position (my first out of college) and I really love it even if the lower pay is not sustainable for me longterm, but I went ahead and started applying elsewhere just in case the furlough went on longer than anticipated.

Now (somewhat to my own surprise) I have another promising position that I'm currently interviewing for and feel good about, with the potential for better pay and a better title. I do still really love my current job and company, and I will be very much needed once we start to regain business, but at the same time if I have a better opportunity elsewhere, I don't know that I could turn it down, especially considering that there is still no firm indication of my return date to work and I don't qualify for unemployment in the meantime.

This pandemic is turning a lot of things upside down, so do you have any tips or advice on etiquette and expectations in a situation like this? I'm not even sure if there would be an appropriate way to leverage an offer in the current job/economic climate, and I certainly don't want to be burning bridges. How can I best look out for myself and my financial/professional future while also being considerate to both my current employer and the potential employer interviewing me?"
University job I interviewed for frozen due to crisis - what do I do now?,"If anyone has any insight on University hiring at the moment, I would really appreciate it. I applied for a new position at a private University as a part of the Student Life team. I made it through a phone interview, then an all-day interview on campus, and I know I was one of three candidates for the position. I felt like I hit it off very well, but the week after my interview, University campuses closed down. I sent a follow-up email about a month ago asking about the position and a new timeline, but pretty much all I got back was that the position is on hold.

This is a really amazing position and aligns very well to my career goals, but I'm worried that it's just not going to happen anymore. The position itself was entirely new, so it's probably very easy for the university to justify canning it entirely to save money. On the flip side, the university just announced that it is increasingly scholarships for the student org that the position would be in charge of, making me think that they might still value the position. At this time, the campus is planning to reopen in the fall.

Does anyone have any advice or insight at this time? I haven't heard anything back since mid April, but I'm worried about coming off as annoying if I send any more emails. I don't mind waiting for a better time to start this position, but I don't even know if I'm their selected candidate. Should I send another follow up email?

Tl;dr The position I interviewed at a university was put on hold a month ago. Is there anything I can do, or should I just move on?"
Would an employer be understanding if someone else were to drop off your resume while you’re in isolation?,"I’ve been out of a job for 4 months now (quit my job and moved at a bad time) I’ve been able to use savings to pay for everything but I am in need of a job badly. I live in a very small town (2000 people) and a place I am interested in is hiring but only allows applying in person, however, I just had surgery and am high risk for covid-19 so I am self isolating and my roommate is the only one who leaves the house and I would like him to drop off my resume at this place. Would this be inappropriate? Or should I just wait until I am able to go in myself? I’ve already tried calling to ask if they accept emailed resumes but they never ended up getting back to me."
Should I disclose pregnancy to new employer before drug test?,"I started a new job recently but because of Covid-19, they do not want me to get the drug test or physical done before they open which most likely won't happen until mid June. They even sent me a revised job offer stating that if I didn't pass the tests then they could fire me. I'm very confident I'll pass both but I'm 5 months pregnant and didn't plan to tell my employer until I passed everything. I'm afraid if I tell them before I take the tests that they'll come up with some reason why they can't keep me and fire me either before or after I take my drug test/physical. Should I tell them now so they can prepare for my impending absence or just wait until everything comes back clean and I'm in for good? Thanks!"
"I want to quit my job to avoid exposure to covid, but fear loosing a good reference.","I have worked at a grocery store chain for the past 8 years, I have been a hard worker, gotten raises, and was offered to be a dept manager, but schedule wouldn't work for my family.   


Lately I was working less anyway to help care for my daughter.  I was out for a while but I have to go back next week, but don't feel comfortable working due to covid.  But I fear that if I quit I may lose a good reference from my manager, and the last 8 years of hard work will be for nothing when I am ready to to rejoin the workforce after covid.    


What do you think?  Do you think employers would be understanding of quitting a job during covid or do you think they would frown upon it?"
In-person Interview During Pandemic,"Hello everybody,

I  have been asked to come in for an in-person interview for a food-testing/quality control lab position. It concerns me that the employer has asked me to do this given the quarantine order. Should this be  a red flag? My immediate thought is the company must not care very much about their employees let alone their social responsibility during the pandemic. However, maybe this is more normal than I realize?

&#x200B;

What are you thoughts? I am still getting paid from my old job through July, and I would love opportunity to have some overlapping paychecks. However, the job does only pay $15/hr, and part of me is thinking I shouldn't even bother given their disregard of the pandemic."
Temporarily laid off but was told to “find something else”,"I’m a college student finishing her last year. I’ve been at the same company for 3 years work as a graphic designer but mainly as a digital press operator.

Due to class this semester I was only working 8 hours a week. It wasn’t until March 23rd that I was told not to come in due to the lack of work. Understandable. At the end of it, I personally wanted to quit and move on to a graphic design position at an advertising agency. I never wanted to go down like this on these terms (uncontrollable situation, I know).

I filed for unemployment recently due to my busy schedule and have been getting money that way. I texted one of my coworkers who is one of the higher-ups I guess you could say and engages in what is called a manager’s meeting. Thursday I had asked when there is an expected due date for return. He said the following:


“We have no date in mind.  There just is not enough work. I would try to find something else.”

With that being said, I said thank you for the update. I haven’t given it much thought up until now. I plan on talking to my other coworker to see if I can get some other insight but it’s late so it’ll be pushed till some time tomorrow possibly. She is still working as a digital press operator except she is full time/has kids/etc. So I can understand why she still has her job but I don’t technically.

I didn’t quit but I feel I have lost my job completely but I do not have any guarantee on that. Not fired, just let go. I’m unsure of who to talk to, what to discuss, and how to go about this. Any advice will be helpful."
NYC security guard license,My license expires at the end of this month. I cannot find a single place offering 8 hour annual classes which I need to renew.

Not sure if that applies to this license. Anyone have any info on this?
College student working as a tutor and a pharmacy assistant looking for a new job during COVID,"I've been working as a pharmacy assistant for 2 years and I've been tutoring both high school and college level math and science for 3 years.

I'm having a hard time finding tutoring opportunities with COVID so I've been relying on working full time as a pharmacy assistant to make money. I love my coworkers and most of the customers but it's gotten so busy and stressful and I don't think I can continue working full time until September. I have virtually no other real life qualifications and I was planning on working as a tutor while working with a research grant (that I lost during COVID due to lab closing) during the summer. What other jobs are even available to me during COVID that I should look at so I can pay my bills?"
Feeling uncomfortable & unsure what to do,"Hi all,

I wrote a post in this sub a few weeks ago regarding job burnout - unfortunately I’m still at this job, but am actively applying to jobs every single day! In the meantime, I wanted to ask about something specific I’ve been dealing with for maybe 1.5 months. 

I was given a responsibility at work that I think is inherently wrong. Without explaining it too much, we’re deducting pay for a service currently closed during quarantine, and there are about 50 employees who will not be getting a credit or refund for these deductions, and they’ll be leaving the firm in June (this was decided by upper management). I’ve been basically tasked to tell these people “well, sorry, not our problem!” (That’s more or less a quote from my boss). 

I feel like I’m helping rob people, and it’s honestly making me sick. I have a long history of depression & anxiety which I can keep in check for the most part, but since these decisions were made- I am constantly nervous and on the brink of tears (or just crying), I’ve bitten all my nails off, and I’m having a really difficult time keeping up with my other responsibilities. I’m really not trying to be dramatic about any of this, I’ve just never felt so strongly that something I was doing was wrong. Another issue is that I have a hard time separating professional from personal, so when people vent to me about this, it just completely drains me. 

Am I allowed to tell management that I’m not comfortable with this responsibility, or will this reflect badly on me? (I’m trying to leave the firm anyway so I’m not sure that it’s worth it). Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?"
"Quarantine Delivery - which company is best (Doordash, Postmates, Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc.)?","Stimulus money isn't going to cut it, and I need to work somehow. Problem is, I may be in a moderately high risk category.

Lately, I've beeb looking at delivery services like Uber Eats, Doordash, Postmates, and Grubhub. I know there have been some comparison posts of these services in the past, but all the ones I found were at least a year ago.

Is anyone else doing delivery right now? If so, which service are you delivering with, and which one is the best right now?"
Apply for decent remote job or build portfolio and hope in-person work starts again soon?,"Hello all. I am an animation student and I haven't been able to get an internship the past couple years. Totally my fault, but I definitely regret not trying. 

I found a couple places that are still hiring, and one I think I'm qualified for. It is remote work, like most jobs right now., 40 hours a week.  The only problem is that I've learned over the past couple weeks that remote work SUCKS. I don't know if I'd be able to handle 8 hours of it every day, I've already turned nocturnal from regular school work. If it were with a company like Disney or something I'd probably be more willing to do it, but it is with an ad company and I wouldn't be directly doing 3D animation work. Is it worth it to suck it up and apply for this job, or would it be better to work on and get better at 3D animation on my own time and hope non-remote is an option soon?"
Should I take reduced hours/reduced pay?,"My company is offering voluntary reduced hours due to COVID - 3 day work weeks for up to 4 months with pay reduced to 60%. Heath insurance and other benefits stay the same. Part of me looks at this as an opportunity to refresh and reflect, catch up on training and education goals. I'm in my mid 40's and have never taken a break from working since I was 15. The pay cut would have almost no effect on my bottom line - my wife works, we have no debt, we have a very healthy emergency savings account. After running the numbers, even with the cut I will earn more than I did 2 years ago. However, another part of me feels like this would be an irresponsible move."
How to ask about missing Covid pay premium,"A little background before I start.
I work for a fast food restaurant and our hours are all managed through an app we are invited to when hired.  The owners have a few stores so they have a big group message feature they supply updates in.  This includes things like new menu items, workplace policies, and in this case responses to the pandemic.

On March 23 we recurved what looked like a copy pasted message from one of the higher ups in the fast food chain. It stated starting on As of that day (3/23) employees will be receiving a 25% pay increase until further notice.  The owner of the store I worked at then sent a follow up message stating it would go into affect 2 days later (3/25) due to when I payroll reset.  

I noticed at first that nothing was changing, but just figured it was taking an extra cycle to come into affect.  I was paid again this morning and once again it didn’t seem to reflect this update.  I went into the app we use and added up the hours for the previous two weeks, the last pay period, and with tax the amount matched the amount I was paid.  That is, without the 25% “hazard pay”. It’s been over a month so I know that it should have come into affect by now.

I’m one of the newer employees, started just over two months ago, and one of the younger ones as well (18).  

I would think the issue isn’t only affecting me, but none have my coworkers have brought anything up or said anything either.  

What would be the best or most professional way to inquire about the hazard pay not being implemented/ working properly?

Any advice on how to proceed with this would be great, thank you in advance!"
Boss is trying to make us go to the office and take our desktops home. Is this worth fighting over?,"I work for a small business (less than 15 people in the office) and we've all been working from home since mid-March. Since then we've been using a VPN to access any work files. This morning our boss sends an email saying we need to go to the office and pick up our monitors and CPUs from our office and take them home to continue working on them instead of using our personal computers.

I live in a very small apartment with my immunocompromised grandmother and I do not like to go outside unless its for essential items. I do not want to risk bringing COVID-19 home, and I also barely have any room for a desktop monitor and CPU (which is why I only have a laptop). Not to mention any cords or wires that may be needed for the computer to function properly at home.

I truly do not want to go through that effort, especially when I'm only working 12 hours a week now due to COVID-19 and will have to lose desk space for other work I will need to do. I have a 1099 job that requires me to physically write notes, and any desk space I have will be gone with the monitor and keyboard  there.

I genuinely don't know what to do. Is this a battle I should just avoid and just get the desktop? I'm grateful to even still have this job, and especially 2 during this time but I feel like I'm risking/sacrificing more for this job that what it offers (less space, exposure to COVID-19, etc., less hours) when there has been no issues working from home so far.

Any advice is greatly appreciated!"
Is it rude to not answer managers work related questions when manager wont give me hours during quarantine?,"So I work at a dental office as reception and we shut down about a month and a half ago due to Covid, since then obviously our hours have been cut except for our manager. 

Every single day I get texts or calls asking work related questions as to how to do something or to do a report and one time I was even stuck on a 1 hour call to guide her on how to do something, one day I just didn't respond to her as she refused to count my hours for help so she ended up reaching out to one of my co-workers who she knows i'm close with and ask her why i'm not responding...

&#x200B;

My question is, is it rude of me or can I get in trouble for me not responding to her if she's refusing to give me hours (i'm hourly, not salary) She knows i'm more than willing to go in for a couple hours, she just doesn't want to pay us.

EDIT: I shouldn’t say I completely “ignore” my manager, she knows why I don’t reply to her her, I usually end up replying kind of vague by saying it’s very hard to teach over text or phone or not right away. I’ve asked a few times how to clock in my hours and I always get a “I’ll get back to you” or she dismisses it and now I’m feeling like I’m being taken advantage of."
"Took a leave of absence, LOA is almost over, haven’t heard about my schedule yet.","Hello r/jobs. I didn’t know the appropriate flair so I just put covid 19 because it’s somewhat relevant.

I’m an essential worker at a large retail department store. I recently took a leave of absence due to me just needing some time off away from people. Like I wanted to spray myself down and quarantine a bit. People are still coming in to shop without gloves or masks and well, yeah. I just needed to feel safer for a while. I’m not the only person to take a leave of absence. A lot of people have taken leaves of absence, and have been calling out on the regular due to the pandemic (not being able to find child care, health concerns, etc).

I took two weeks off (14 days). The HR manager told me to call back a week into my LOA so I can get information on my schedule because I’m out of the system and wouldn’t be able to check on the app. I called at the time. I spoke to HR team members and they said the HR manager would call me back with my schedule. I waited a week and still no call.

I have called twice this week and have gotten the same response. The HR manager was supposed to call me back by the end of the work day today, and she didn’t. I am supposed to return to work on Sunday.

I was thinking of stopping by work tomorrow to ask in person what’s going on with my schedule. I have an immediate manager for my department, and a manager above her. I was also thinking of trying to text my manager to get with the higher manager (he usually makes the schedules) to find out what’s going on. My immediate manager is usually very responsive. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t seem to stop thinking the worst. When I was a seasonal team member, they told me I was being kept and then they tried to let me go, and then they ended up keeping me. I am a reliable worker (I never call out) and I am always covering other departments that need help.  I’m worried and I can’t shake the fact that I feel like they might be trying to pull a fast one on me again."
Temporarily laid off yet still being asked to work.,"I work in design and sales in residential construction and about 6 weeks ago was laid off temporarily due to a lack of business. Unfortunately we still have ongoing projects (some of which I was heavily involved in) and I am now being contacted daily by my employer and sub contractors with questions and problems. My supervisor even asked me to visit a job site yesterday to inspect the progress. I told him I was taking the health warnings seriously and wont leave my home unless its essential.

I dont like the situation at all. My nerves are on edge all of the time and my stress shoots up once I hear my phone ring. I'm expecting more calls today and I'm not sure what to do. They've told me to record my hours and they will compensate me when I return but to be honest I'm skeptical of that and even so ... the 10-15 minutes I work on the phone is not worth the interruption or the stress. 

I'm the only person in our small company that can answer alot of these questions and so I worry about bringing up my problems with it. I think it could have a negative impact on my reputation and also affect my references further down the line, not to mention the clients who I might be letting down by refusing to assist.

Has anybody found themself in a similar situation? Any advice?"
"Was hired for an NYC office position with new company, but with COVID-19 and my wife's new position, how can I have a conversation about being transferred to the Los Angeles office?","I work in the corporate real estate field for an international service provider. I have lived and worked in LA for the last few years with one company, and just recently (in the last month) was hired to join another company in their NYC office. My wife and I thought it could be a cool adventure to try living in a new city, but obviously that was before COVID-19. We actually haven't moved yet, because the stay-at-home orders are in effect and the new company totally understands that.

Now, we're both apprehensive about moving to epicenter of the virus in the US, but mostly because my wife was recently hired at a huge company and this will be her first major job in her field since graduating college. I don't want her to sacrifice this opportunity for my move.

This new company I work for has regional offices, one of which is the LA office. I was never interviewed by anyone from LA nor offered a position here. However, we are all part of the ""strategic consulting"" group nationwide and lots of people work on different projects across the U.S.

My question is: how do I start a conversation (and with who) about this change in my wife and I's plans, and how I still want to be with the company, but work from Los Angeles?"
Reaching out during their hiring freeze?,"I’m really interested in a job and they emailed me about two and a half weeks ago to say that with the current situation, the position would temporarily be put on hold as the organization is closed for now. 

They emphasized that I would not need to resubmit my application when they choose to reopen. 

Would anyone recommend reaching out about possibly offering to assist remotely? They never accepted me explicitly, and I’d love to hold off on other applications so I can have this job in particular should they eventually choose to hire me. But I don’t want to be annoying exactly. I’d like to increase my appeal if possible by keeping in contact with them and offering to help as I can.

I don’t know if this made much sense, but any advice would be awesome."
Looking to be a medical assistant,"Greetings, I am about to graduate college and want to be an MA for a few years before applying to PA school. I am not a certified MA but have an EMT-B certification. I have seen that many people are able to get this position with an EMT-B certification so I began applying all around. Unfortunately, I have only received one call back. Do you think this is because of COVID-19 and the fact that I would need training to begin working and it's just not the right time? I am getting pretty upset but I don't want to give up. I have an excellent resume, I have been published in research, and I'm pretty sociable/outgoing, etc. I DEFINITELY didn't expect immediate callbacks (I am aware I am not a certified MA) but can someone just agree that it might just not be the right time to hire a person like me? I have patience and can wait until the fall/early next year just looking for some advice! thanks everyone :)"
Actively looking for a job during lockdown?,"Hi all. I work in Mexico in the energy sector. 

I was inching closer to leaving my job before the whole COVID thing started (as in, when my country went into full lockdown I had a four week timeline to start looking for the next job). 

But then this whole thing exploded and I got trapped here, in a job that basically exhausted its possibilities and with bosses that don't take our health seriously. Even if a lot of us could work from home full time, they still make us go to the office one or two days a week. 

I'm personally not happy with that and I'd like to look for another job, but I'm not sure how good of an idea it would be. Here I have a lot of seniority and would be one of the last people they'd cut off, while in the next job I'd be the new guy and probably the least likely to be kept if they had to do a layoff. On the other hand, I'm a specialist in a very specialized field (energy sector), any company that hires me would probably do it knowing well what for they would hire me. 

On the other hand, we don't know where lockdown will finish and, particularly, how the job market will be when it ends. Somehow I get the feeling that waiting until then might be waiting too much because it may be much harder to find a job during recession.

What do you think? Should I endure it here and take a risk later? Or should I try to change horses in the middle of the race?"
"Laid off, hiring freezes, job leads drying up, visa pressure, ghosted by recruiters, how should I move forward？","Here’s my backstory: After graduating in May 2019 with a BFA in graphic design, I have been on the job search for 6 months. After 6 months of hard work and frustration, I have accepted my previous position back in January, and have been working diligently that my supervisor and my boss are giving me positive reviews. I was going to file my OPT STEM extension on April, but one day during mid-March, I was being called into the boss‘ room at the end of the day, and being told that we were being laid off due to the Coronavirus pandemic seeing our clients cancelling the events. Before I go, he told me verbally that the company would rehire me after the pandemic‘s over. 

Since then I have been back on the job search again. Now, before you comment “Just get a job at the grocery store bro!”, let me remind you that *OPT VISAS ARE ONLY ALLOWED TO WORK ON WHATEVER IT’S RELATED TO THEIR MAJORS OF STUDY*. So that means other than freelancing on the sideline, I can’t just apply to any jobs because this would violate my visa conditions, but again, those are drying up as well. As I apply to positions left and right, I have been contacted by recruiters who clearly expresses their interest, but then completely ghosted me after I replied to express my interest or just get flat out rejected. Now as I barely keeping my OPT status active, I don’t know how to move forward with the job search, as most companies have frozen hiring or laying off people, and my visa status will expire on July with no idea when my former boss will call me back, is there anyway to move forward in this trying times?"
Should I apply to jobs during quarantine or wait til after?,"My mom thinks I should be applying for jobs so that I can start orientation once quarantine ends, but my dad says I shouldn’t because of the risk. My mom thinks it’s a good idea to apply now so that I can get employed before all the jobs he taken up. Should I send out some applications so that I can hit the ground running once quarantine ends or should I wait until after quarantine is over to start applying? 

btw; I’m just a teenager looking for minimum wage work since school got canceled"
Job security and lack of HR response. I am down to the wire and seeking some advice.," So, I'm going to try to make this long story short.

In October, I applied for and accepted to start a job at a world renowned institution in July. In early March, I went in contract to purchase my first home. Fast forward to the beginning of April and COVID-19 in full effect. I am an essential worker but the company annouced hiring freezes, paycuts and furloughs, across the board. I spoke with my manager last week and was ensured that my position is secure and has been justified to HR on their end however, I have yet to hear anything from HR in response to an email that I sent last week requesting an official employment reassurance letter and information regarding said pay cuts and potential furloughs.

It's getting down to the wire, as I am set to move in three weeks and need a letter to verify all of my employment contingencies have been met for my home loan. Though I know it's a crazy time right now, I can't help but feel that HR is dragging their feet. 

My question is, how long do I give them to respond before ""bugging"" them again (it's been 10 days)? Should I apply for new positions in anticipation of them backing out, due to COVID-19? 

More so, what would you do if you were faced with these issues?

Thanks!"
Regretting taking part-time summer job?,"I am currently 18 and just finished my freshman year of college. I had accepted a part-time position as an grocery online order shopper at Giant Eagle and am kind of scared of the current situation. The problem is that this is my first job and I was hoping for experience to add to my empty resume. 

Is it worth the risks? Should I test the job out to see if it is safe enough? Maybe, I’m just nervous.

Any advice?

Thanks!"
Should I disclose my furloughed status to potential employers?,"Hi All,

Hoping I can ask your advice.

I am currently furloughed due to the COVID19. They made it clear that this was not performance based and the intention was to bring furloughed employees back once they could. Basically everyone on my particular team was furloughed either partially or fully.

I've been taking this time off to try and explore next steps within my career and how to improve. I've applied to some jobs and have started hearing back. I have a story ready on why I'd like these particular roles (want to get into a role more focused on marketing), but should I also disclose the fact that I am currently furloughed to appear upfront and honest?

Look forward to hearing your thoughts!

Eric"
"Struggling to find work in my field and I want to change careers, but not sure what the smartest steps during a time like this.","I recently graduated with a B.S. degree in IT and moved to Raleigh for a help desk specialist position. Just two months into my contract, COVID-19 wrecked the company and cuts were made. My contract  was cut almost a month ago and so far the competition has skyrocketed and I  can’t find work in IT. Filled for unemployment and I have enough saved for 3-4 months.

Its been almost a month and I keep getting told that there are hiring freezes. Other problem is that people with more experience have also lost their job and are picking up all the temp work. When I first moved to the area I had 4 interviews the first week and had a job the second week...

Before I went for my degree I was already interested in Web dev and had taken some free courses online.  I took two classes in web development at college that covered html and css and some JavaScript. Reinforced that I really enjoyed it.

Since then I got caught up with my classes and other areas in IT. I  graduated and moved to Raleigh for the help desk job thinking I was  going to pursue something in IT.  I honestly have not enjoyed my help desk role and have no interest in other fields in IT.

Web dev has been in the back of my mind for years. Being let go from work has given me a lot of time to think about things. I started learning again and really want to pursue it.

I am concerned about the economy. Competition for jobs are up and I know that even before COVID-19 competition is high for entry web dev jobs. So I am concerned that I may struggle to find work in what looks to be a recession. But so far I have had no luck finding work in IT anyways...

Another thought. I have no job currently and my experience points to me trying to find a new help desk job.  But I want to change my career focus. The pressure to get a help desk job is to get that first 1-2  years experience in IT. However, I am not sure that I should be focused on that if I want to do web dev.  So maybe its ok if I choose alternative work while I work on getting a web dev job? If I decide to go back to IT in 6 months I can excuse my absence easily because of COVID-19.

sorta tldr:

So to sum it up, I dont know if I want to try to compete for a job I dont want. If I wanted to pursue IT I should be getting certs and working on homelabs and stuff. I should be pushing to make connections and writing cover letters and fine tuning my resume. All for something I do not want longterm. But whats the alternative? Work at Target or something that pays near poverty wages until I get a portfolio together and start applying for web dev positions. I could theoretically make that work. I havent been approved for unemployment yet so here's hoping for that (I worked all through college).

Competition will be high and if I want to change my career focus I am not sure where I should be focused. Not everyone reading this will understand the differences in IT and web dev, but could have a say in switching careers in a time like this. I do believe the degree relates enough to look good for jobs, but I will need to build a portfolio.

Thoughts? advice?"
How can you ask about the security of your employment?,I have fears and some actual reasons to believe my employment may be furloughed or laid off entirely. I want to ask my HR about the possibilities so I can prepare myself financially and mentally. I work for a very small company (less then 10 employees) in WV that provides repair services to electronic coal/salt mining equipment.
"Might have my offer rescinded tomorrow, what questions should I be ready to ask?","I’m a graduating senior supposed to start in August 2020. Last week, a classmate who will be starting at the same company (but in June) had a call with HR and had their job offer rescinded due to COVID-19. 

HR reached out to me to schedule a call for tomorrow. If the worst happens, what kind of questions should I be ready to ask?"
Struggling To Find Work During Pandemic,"I’m 22 years old and just recently beat cancer after almost a year battling it. I’m trying to get back into the workforce but sadly only have retail experience and now seems like a terrible time for job hunting. I’ve been advised to try to stay home as my immune system is still rebuilding and I’m prone to getting sick but I want to work and get money to save up to move out eventually and pursue career.

I’ve tried applying for unemployment but the same lucky I had with SSI while being treated :(

I’ve looked around my area (NJ) for remote work but haven’t had any luck. I’m honestly willing to do any type of remote work so long as it pays a decent wage. Any advice?"
"I want to quit my job for a temp summer job, but I’m a student and we’re in a pandemic","I’m a physics student and support myself financially. I have an opportunity to do some awesome research this summer and get paid for it. I really want to do it, but here’s the thing: it’s temporary, and I’d have to quit my current job where I make 3 times as much money. The pay cut isn’t a huge deal to me because I have a good pile of savings, I kind of hate my current job anyway, and I feel that the new experience will be much more valuable for my future because I want to work in science. I’m just so worried I won’t have a job after the summer. I have secured an on campus job that pays relatively well for fall, but they said they won’t know whether funding will be cancelled until July. I guess I just wanted to vent."
Leave apprenticeship after this corona pandemic or hold on to it till the economy bounces back?,"So I am currently a 18 year old Security Technician apprentice, a field I don't want to continue in and I have little interest in and working with people I am no so thrilled to work with, so I'm planning on looking for a new job (a casual or part time job on the side while I go through Defence Force recruiting) after the restrictions with the virus is lifted or at least when the restrictions come to a point where looking for a new job is appropriate. However, I am not sure about the economy side of things and if that might impact what ever job I get in the future if I do decide to leave, so I am at a crossroads. Should I continue my apprenticeship which I don't like so I have income or should I leave now or later and get a different job? I also don't have bills or recurring payments to make apart from streaming services (Disney Plus, 2 anime streaming sites and Apple Music)

Also: I have already done the first step of the recruitment process with the Defence Force and I can apply to the jobs I am eligible for for 3 years before I need to do it again, and I can do the role I want to do in the ADF (Australian Defence Force) but my apprenticeship is 4 years and I don't want to lose the role.

(Didnt know if I should put a Corona or Job Searching flair, COVID-19 seemed more appropriate)"
take unpaid time off due to fear of COVID19?,"I work at a place that doesn't allow for work from home, even though most of my work can be done from home. I'm job searching now and got plenty of savings (enough for years, and I estimate a 3 month timeframe to get a different job in my field)

I want to ask for 3 month unpaid time off due to fear of virus, is that a valid reason to give them? If they turn me down I might just quit.

Thanks"
Customer claimed he had the virus and they let him go.,"I work for a dollar store, and last night a customer was talking to his neighbor in line and made comment that he tested positive for covid-19 but after 2 weeks of no symptoms they released him. I told my manager for that night and she looked concerned as I did, so she took over register as I started cleaning like mad. Then I washed my hands and sanitized as well. But we had to continue to work the shift out. 

When I got home I touched nothing, told my mother and she told me “You’re panicking, he said he had it, they wouldn’t have let him go if they thought he was a hazard. You did what you should now leave it alone” 

I also doubt that anyone will call corporate hq about the incident and I will still have to go into work, I won’t know until tomorrow night. 

Is there anything I can do in this situation?"
Is Covid-19 pandemic affecting the length of prehire screenings or am I being impatient/paranoid?,"Hi all,

Background: I received and accepted a written job offer on Monday.  Soon thereafter instructions for drug screening and consent forms for a background check were sent to my inbox through an automated HR system.  The HR rep never gave me a timeline on how long this step would take and she also hasn't given me an expected start date.  I completed the drug test on Monday and I'm still waiting to hear back if everything checked out OK.  The testing center said 1-2 business days and therein lies my concern.

My questions to the sub: Is anyone else experiencing delays in background checks or is a week fairly normal?  The drug screening was done through Lab Corp and several friends have suggested they're likely inundated with coronavirus tests, which I can believe.  My other question is when is it appropriate to follow-up with HR if I haven't heard anything to make sure all my ducks are in a row?  My thought would be this Friday afternoon or Monday, but I also don't want to come across as impatient.  Thanks in advance!"
I quit my job last week and now I’m regretting it. Advice?,"
I’ve been a Medical Assistant for 10 years. Just moved to another state with my husband after a lifetime of living in CA. It’s been a difficult adjustment especially with Covid going on and to top it off, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and started chemo in the midst of us moving. 

I began my new job at an Internal Medicine office 2 weeks after arriving to our new place and long story short, the job wasn’t what I expected. I hated it. I remember I would cry almost everyday due to the stress and anxiety I felt just thinking about going to work. Not to mention the constant worry I felt for my mom. So last week, I decided to quit. Luckily my husband is working so I know we’ll have a roof over our head these upcoming months but, I feel so guilty for leaving a well-paying job while people are losing their jobs left and right. 

To be honest, the medical field was never something I wanted to do. I quit this job hoping to change careers completely. The downside is, the future doesn’t look too bright as far as the economy goes. Although I absolutely hated that job, I feel like a should’ve stuck to it even if it meant putting my mental health in the back burner for a while. Everything just happened so fast. Any advice?"
Advice about working for a construction company. And maybe about life in general.,Hi so I'm in highschool but now we are doing online learning and I have a lot of free time to do stuff. I applied to a couple jobs and a construction company I applied to wants to set up an interview for a general labor position. I was wondering if I should pursue this or just go back to work with my summer job. I'm 17 and havent worked in construction before but it could be interesting and I have done manual labor previously as a job and it wasn't bad. I think it wasn't that bad because the business was a family operated and small. And I had a decent amount of downtime to rest between lifting heavy things or helping fix things. Any advice is appreciated thank you.
Is there any point in sending out applications right now?,I'm a Marketing major graduating in less than a month. with the current state of things am I just wasting my time sending out application?

Salary Negotiations in a Recession,"I am almost to the point of getting a new job in a technical quality management possession in a pretty recession proof industry. I'm a bit confused as how to go about salary negotiations due to the current economic climate. Many experts are saying that the COVID-19 Pandemic could likely onset the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.

I'm unemployed and I'm don't want to risk giving a salary range that will make them rescind their offer. Plus, I imagine there are a lot more options in the market now to get this type of job as more and more people lose their jobs. I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to negotiate up (salaries that would be seen in a healthy/stable economic situation) or just take whatever offer they give me so I at least have a job? Any insight?"
Online Job Offer Response,"Hello.

So I need help trying to come up with a response to an email from an online job that I applied for sometime ago.

They want me to move on top the next step of the application. I am still interested, but my problem is that I no longer am sure if I can do the work because of the present situation that we are in with the pandemic. My partner is now working from home, I have a good savings despite being laid off, and I have started collecting unemployment, so we are comfortable and I would probably get more from unemployment than I would the job (20 hours a week at $12.50 and hour). Initially, I applied for the job because I work in education and we have a lot of breaks.

I  don't think that I can handle the job at the moment because, quite frankly, my dog has been a nightmare to deal with the last few weeks. I am also trying to keep on top of helping a family member adjust to online learning that started up this week. But mostly, it is the darn dog! She is just over a year and still puppy-ish and also a demanding breed (she's half-Great Pyrenees). We're struggling enough to keep her occupied while my partner is working. I love her a lot, but she's still in training and very much a ""I'll do what I want when I want to"" type of dog.I cannot imagine it going well if both of us try to work at the same time. Is there a way that I convey this to the employer? I don't think it is wise to say that the reasons are due to my dog. 

Would something like be acceptable to respond to their email with?:  ""Due to unforeseen family related circumstances that have arisen due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, though I am interested in the position, I find that right now I cannot commit to enough time to this job opportunity. Is there any chance that I can defer interest for now until a better time comes along?""

The job is supposed to be a flexible, independent contractor position, and they post opportunities frequently, so I don't think that they are exactly counting on me for the job or that I am their first pick, if that makes sense. There wasn't even an interview, just an application that I filled out more than a month ago.

&#x200B;

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you."
What's the most absurd/bad thing your employer has told you during the covid-19 lock down?,"I was lucky and it was business as usual where I work, apart from everyone working remotely.However, a friend of mine got fired and just got the papers via courier and some other people I know were told ""when people work remotely, they only work for 4 hours so you're going part time"". Has anything similar happened to you during this pandemic?"
Help getting a job,"How do I get a job without an ID, I didn’t apply for one before all the dmv’s in my county closed(Los Angeles) I’ve called government offices here and they all say they never thought about it.

Finding a job or wait on EI?,"For some context. I’m from Canada. I had been working part-time at a gym and was offered full time there. The week that I was supposed to start working full-time, my gym shut down because of COVID-19. It’s been a good month and a half now since I last worked. 

I refused to get onto EI during the first four weeks just because I still live at home and don’t have a lot of bills to cover and cuz I didn’t want to be a burden (as weird as it may sound). I have already apply for EI but I have doubts I may qualify for it as I had only been working part time for the last four months and have yet to start working fulltime before I got laid off. 

Initially my workplace was supposed to open this coming week but I received an email from higher ups saying we will be closed indefinitely until we get the go-ahead from the health authorities and is uncertain when that day will come. 

Right now. I’m deciding on applying out to jobs nearby that are hiring. There’s a cleaning position at a hospital and it pays pretty well. 

Would I be burning bridges with my old workplace if I’m to apply out to jobs? Is this a bad decision I’m making? I have already came across news articles saying that our national lockdown and social distancing practice will continue until a vaccine is created and it won’t be until sometime next year or longer.

To add some more... I would definitely go back to my old workplace once we re-open but because of the uncertainties of our lockdown... I don’t think it’s a good idea for me to wait on IE."
Question on what to write to an employer about a job I applied for right before Covid19 hit,"Ok so I submitted an animation test for a job as a 2D Animator right before things started shutting down due to covid 19. About a week after that happened I sent a follow up email asking how they were doing in this pandemic and asked if they had seen my animation test. They responded thanking me for checking in and said they sent the test to their CEO for review. That was 3/17, and it’s April now. 

I’m wondering should I send them another email asking about the position? I don’t want to come off as rude obviously but I’m wondering if there’s a way to word it so I’m not putting any pressure on them and to politely ask if the position was still available and not cancelled. Or if I should wait till April 17th so it’s exactly a month after they responded to me?

If anyone could think of a sample thing to send them as an example I’d really appreciate it. Or if they think I shouldn’t send them anything because it’s too soon, I’d really just like to know what’s the right play here."
Should i leave my job right now ?,"I am at work as i type this, i just got promoted to lead last week, went from 14.25$/hr to 16$/hr, there was 2 confirmed cases of corona in my building on march 26th and march 27th, about an hour ago i called 911 for someone on the ground with respiratory issues, ambulance came and took the person, the person works in the same department as the 2 people that are positive for corona, my entire family wants me to quit and not look back, i am on the edge right now, i talked to my boss who is currently at home and he justified it by saying that im going to end up having to go to a grocery store sooner or later and i could get it there aswell, but im not spending 60 hours a week in a grocery store seeing truck drivers from all over the us, i am on the tipping point of quitting right now, but i remember the job search and how hard it was, what should i do ?

It is worth noting that i had very severe asthma as a child, and i had pneumonia 4 years ago.

UPDATE: boss asked me to come in and sign my resignation, i told him i never resigned, i asked for time off and he refused it, im still not coming in to work tho, if they want me gone they have to fire me."
Should I go to work or stay home?,"I'm an installer for this company and every day I do work in people's homes and occasionally business. This whole week I been off because of Corona and now I got a text from my boss saying that were working next week. 

I'm not sure if I should go in or not. My company has been trying to play it safe. They passed out hand sanitizer and gloves, forcing everyone to wash their hands, wiping down tools and other equipment, enforcing the 6ft rule, and they call our customers to make sure if it's ok before we come and most of them say yes.

I live in Missouri and the number of cases are going up and I'm afraid of getting it from someone who probably doesn't know that they have it. I live with my father who is 65 and I'm more afraid of him getting it than me. I been trying to take social distancing seriously and so has my dad. 

So what should I do? I want to work but at the same time I want to be safe. The worst case scenario is I lose my job. If that happens I will be fine for 6 months or so."
have been called back in to work but precautions sound sketch,"so my office closed last week due to this virus and late last week my supervisor sent out an email saying that we are considered essential. i work at a tms center and its a newtreatment for  depression that involves send magnetic waves into the brain to activate neurons. the week before we closed we had a lot of patients cancelling or missing.   


when we closed i thought it would last until this whole thing blows over but i just got a text saying i am on the schedule for tomorrow. i asked about what protections we will have and she said just cloth masks and gloves. i then asked her about the N95 masks that are recommended for healthcare workers and she said she has been unable to order them. Only reason I am really worried is because i have my dad who has a compromised immune system at home and don't want to drag it back to him.  


I really love my job and don't want to quit. i also know that quitting my job at this time would be extremely short sighted and foolish. however i do feel like my health and the health of my family is super important. what would be the best way about portraying this to my employer?"
Unemployment Question,"I'm not sure if someone will be able to help with this but here we go... I filed my claim for unemployment on 3/17. After hitting 'submit' i realized that my laptop auto-filled some of the information incorrectly. My address, email (got confirmation), name, social, etc are all correct, but for my company, it filled in my personal address instead of the correct one. There's also a section for 'other company info' and of course for this section, it filled everything out correctly with my company. I feel like an idiot for not realizing this and I'm worried because I haven't received my pin in the mail and its been 13 days. 

I've never had to go through this process before and it appears that the unemployment office is overwhelmed right now. The phone number doesn't work and the live chat function is down. What should I do? Be patient or refile?"
How to find a remote job in the information technology field?,"I'm currently working as a firefighter trying to switch to a career in IT. I have an A+ and Network+ cert, and live in small town that doesn't have many jobs. I thought of moving and applying for jobs in bigger cities like Charlotte, Dallas, LA, or NY; however, with the coronavirus idk if that would be possible. Could I find a remote job in IT considering I've never worked in the field before? Also, what sites could I use to find remote jobs. Also, would they pay anywhere near what I'm making now 40k of course I do around 70 to 90 hours a week at the fire department so the hourly pay only comes out to 12 to 15 dollars an hour."

I told him I felt that I was okay to work that I just felt a little unwell and i didn’t want to loose my job. He said it was just protocol and that I was fine that they would send me to the dr should I be worried? I feel like I shouldn’t have said anything now I’m young and this is a great job opportunity that I feel like a screwed up.

"21 year old graduating college, looking for online job","Hi everyone! I’m kinda new to this chat.

I’m a 21 year old Senior student that is graduating this semester with a degree in political science, I’m looking for possible online job opportunities that I could do during this state-wide quarantine. I want to be able to make extra money and get some work experience during the COVID-19 shutdown. Do any of you know a good place to look?"
"Refusing unsafe working conditions vs. coming into work - either way, my finances are screwed","x-post social work

 I currently have a non-patient care role at an inpatient facility. My governor ordered that all non-essential/non-life sustaining workplaces shut down due to COVID-19. The geographic area I'm in has been hit very hard by COVID, so the shelter in place is absolutely necessary. As a healthcare facility, my workplace needs to stay open to continue to meet patient needs. However, my employer is taking the fact that the workplace is ""essential and life-sustaining"" to mean that every employee needs to continue to do their job physically in the facility. My position could be done from home, but my department's requests to telework have been denied. We got a memo that explained ""all employees are essential employees"" so therefore telecommuting during the pandemic is not allowed. Even though my job doesn't involve face-to-face patient interaction, I frequently walk past patients in tight hallway spaces, my department uses a patient lounge as a meeting room, patients often use staff bathrooms, etc. If COVID sweeps through our patient population, there's a high likelihood I could catch it if someone sneezes at the wrong time. My workspace is also not in compliance with CDC social distancing recommendations, so if my coworker one desk over gets sick, it's likely I would too. Did I mention there are several staff members currently on quarantine? Most likely, they passed COVID along to other employees before the health department ordered them to stay home.

On many levels, the fact we still need to physically come into work is so concerning. Many of our patients have conditions that affect their immune system, so it's in their best interest to limit the number of people in the building to reduce their chances of exposure. For the sake of the nurses, housekeepers, and dietary staff who do not have the ability to perform their roles remotely, it's also important to limit transmission and have anyone who can work remotely to stay home. This has been brought to management's attention, but we're being told it's not fair to have some employees work from home while others have to come in. Not fair?!!? It's not fair to our patients if we don't have enough nurses on hand because they contracted COVID from an asymptomatic billing staff member who was not permitted to telecommute. It's not fair to the housekeepers making $12 an hour if they incur thousands of dollars in hospital bills, all because they ran into a quality assurance staff member with COVID in a tight stairwell. (These are fictional examples, but they have the chance of becoming reality if things don't change). Of course, our safety as employees in telework-compatible roles is at risk, and any one/all of us could come down with COVID when we could have just stayed home and practiced social distancing. I'm concerned about a vulnerable family member of mine whose health could be needlessly jeopardized by my employers insistence that EVERYONE works in the office.

Because of the fact my telework request was denied, I now have a difficult decision to make. Management told me we have the right to refuse to come in if we don't feel safe, however once we roll through our PTO we would have to take the leave unpaid. My job/benefits would be held, but I would have no money coming in. The state of emergency could stretch on for months, so I am very concerned since my PTO will be gone next week. I can't afford to be off of work without income for a prolonged period of time, but I also can't afford to go to work and contract COVID. Outside of work, I have only been going out into public once a week to get groceries and gas, so if I take unpaid leave then my chance of getting COVID would be small. But in the event there happens to be airborne COVID particles in the checkout line, I don't know how I would afford my medical bills without any income. I have enough savings to last me for two months, but that is only if there are no emergencies during that time. My health insurance has a very high deductible, so if I get hospitalized I am absolutely screwed. Given the employees with COVID exposure at work, it seems likely I will get COVID if I return to work, but I would be in a (slightly) better financial situation to handle this.

It looks like we may be headed toward a global recession, so the idea of not working for several months is terrifying. I also have a family member who was laid off due to a COVID closure, and it's possible she could be unemployed for months. I may need to help her out financially in the event there are issues with her unemployment application. Then I ask myself: what would happen if I get permanent lung damage from work-acquired COVID and incur thousands of dollars in medical costs each and every year as a result? Or what would happen if the family member who lives with me gets it? They are in a high-risk demographic and the mortality rate is absolutely terrifying. Ten years from now, I don't want to be thinking to myself ""if only I had stayed home from work...""

It feels irresponsible to take unpaid leave, but it also feels irresponsible for me to jeopardize my health and the health of my family. If only my employer agreed to let us work from home, this could all be avoided! I wish I knew an actuary who could run simulations of all the various scenarios that could happen if I go back to work versus if I take unpaid leave. It seems like there is no good solution, so at this point I am trying to choose the option that is ""less bad."" Is anyone in a similar situation right now?"
"Forced on to 100% commission pay plan in January, now being “essential” I have to show up to work but there’s very few customers, options?",Title. The January pay plan was already a pay cut but this is unsustainable. I can’t pay rent if everyone is staying home (as we should be).
Questions to ask the company when interviewing in the current economy,"My boyfriend hates his job and has been looking to change for a while, he is on a second interview for a role in the same industry (Admin role in Advertising / Design / Video Production)

We're obviously concerned about him quitting his current job and the offer falling through eventually due to the COVID-19 recession. **What are good questions to ask the new company in terms of job security, guarantees, business staying active, etc?**

He has 2 months notice and is based in the UK.

Thanks!"
"Accept new, possibly more secure, position or stick with current job and hope covid doesn’t leave me jobless in a month?","After finding myself unemployed for the first time in my adult life, I struggled to find work. Finally, after months, a company I was excited about made me a great offer for a position that was an advance in my career. This was about a month ago, I started a couple of weeks ago. And then...coronavirus. My current job is 100% reliant on the ability of people to socialize in person, but is not a restaurant that can pivot and offer delivery or take out. I still have my job as I am in the corporate office and they plan to reopen, but I don’t know how long they can keep paying us when no one knows when we will be able to open again.

When I was interviewing for this position, I was also interviewing with another company that I was equally excited about. They didn’t move as fast as the place I work now, but I kept the conversation open as I wanted to at least see it through if they wanted to continue to move forward. This position is a pay cut from the current, and a lateral career move from my prior positions, but they are more focused on the digital space, which feels more secure at the moment. They made me an offer this week and I am so torn on what to do. The pay is less of an issue as there is great room for advancement, and it’s great pay for the position, but it is about 1k less per month take home. 

Both companies are great companies, commute (if and when that happens) are minutes different, similar benefits packages, great company culture. If it wasn’t for covid, I’d likely stick with my current position since it’s a great career move and there is nothing I could complain about really. 

To make this harder, because I was on unemployment the last few months, I don’t have any left to claim should I stick with this job now and get laid off shortly after. 

I know no one knows what is going to happen with this coronavirus, but I am looking for any opinions or advice, maybe something will click and help with my decision. My dad just died about a week ago too, and that is making this even worse as he was definitely someone I could go to for these things. Thank you all for any input!"
Boss demanding more work with no pay increase/overtime," 

In an email sent this morning, my direct supervisor said, ""Absolutely no overtime, any hours over 40, will be approved for the foreseeable future. You guys are doing a great job with xxx during the COVID-19 crisis. However, we need to keep this within the allotted, budgeted hours... At times you might exceed that time limit, but please note going over 40 will not be approved. Please keep up with your hours as you go during the week to ensure you do not go over 40. We also can't afford to have folks coming up at the end of the week with only a handful of hours left for Friday. ""

This supervisor also takes time of every other week.

I am an hourly employee at a community newspaper in the United States. I had triple the work put on my shoulders in the last month after layoffs, but I still get paid the same $12 as when I started when I started three years ago (I have a four-year degree and experience, but had to move back in with parents due to mental health issues).

Someone please give me some guidance during this trying time. Do I just say no and that I can't do the extra work?"
I went from loving my job to hating it! How can I adjust to this change?,"I was working in a new hospital cafe. It opened in July of 2019, and I have been working there since August. It was like a mini cafeteria. We were a small team. It was 6 of us in total, including the manager.

Due to the Coronavirus outbreak, they shut our cafe down and decided to shove all of us down to the main cafeteria.

The cafeteria downstairs is a completely different work environment from our cafe.

It's too cluttered down there. It's too many people. Like everyone is all in your face. The staff down there aren't very nice. And all the positions down there are pretty much filled. So it's like we are getting in everyone's way.

I was trying to help out some of the employees with prep by making sandwiches. One of my coworkers from my cafe was over there as well. One of the workers stepped away for a moment, and I guess I was taking over her job. When she came back she was like, ""Okay, you are in my space!"" She was kind of rude about it. Even my coworker told me, ""She wasn't really doing anything anyway.""

My position at my cafe was Utility/Inventory. I washed dishes, did general cleaning, counted inventory, and helped out with prep cooking and line cooking as needed. I tried to help out the dishwashers in the cafeteria with dishes, and they all told me that they are fine and that they got it. It's like they don't want me helping them.

I've been cleaning the dining area in the cafeteria. I've been doing all the utility. There is already a Utility person in the cafeteria. He's a little lazy and doesn't really do his job. I've been doing all of his work. People are telling me to stop doing all of his work for him and have him do it himself, but I am honestly just trying to stay busy because there isn't really anything to do.

When I am done cleaning the dining area, I have nothing else to do!

And I am baffled as to why the seating area in the cafeteria is still open? Groups of people are still eating in there. I know with the coronavirus going around, they are trying to avoid having groups of people together. I think the seating area should be closed, and it should be carry out only.

Also, I think it was unnecessary for them to close down our cafe. I just think they should've closed our seating area, and it should've just been carry out only. The other eatery in the hospital is a coffee shop, and they are still open. The seating area is closed in the coffee shop.

I hate it down in the cafeteria. Our cafe is perfect. It's a small crew, smaller facility, everyone is in their own space, my manager is amazing, the crew is great, the environment is great, etc.

This coronavirus is ruining everything. I hope this shutdown don't last until the summer because I don't know if I can stand working in the cafeteria for that long.

I didn't start working until I was 21. I waited late because I've been dealing with terrible Social Anxiety my entire life. Within the past two years, I've been trying to challenge myself to overcome it. I've been working for the past 7 months, and I don't want to quit this job as I wanted to be there for at least a year to build up my resume.

I am hoping this shutdown blows over soon.

How can I cope?"
Under what circumstances would you ask (or hint at) a supervisor about a bonus?,"I work in the investment industry and as you may know, people are going crazy over the markets. Our whole team of operations has been non stop working our asses off, and we know the company is raking in the cash during this pandemic. I personally have taken on two of the task that have seen the most inflow of work. They sent out an email about how great the company is doing during these hard times. I’m pretty tempted to jokingly bring up bonuses to my supervisor just to see his reaction. We’re on good enough terms that nothing negative would come of it. 

Have any of you asked your boss or supervisor for a bonus?"
Office worker being pushed to work remote. Internet access at home limited to cell phone hotspots. How to engage management for a fair arrangement?,"My wife and I both work for the same company, and due to the age/risk level of the relatives that we live with, we hearing that our company is pushing us to work remotely from home. The location of our house does not have access to reasonable internet. It simply isn't available without paying for the service provider to run new lines to our home. We do limited video streaming, etc. from hotspots on our cell phones, but it is not super reliable or consistent.

My question is, if my company is having us work remote, how should I be approaching the internet issue? Working remote was not on the table when we started, and I don't really feel it's fair to be required to use my personal hotspot for business use without some kind of compensation, or to see whether they'd make some other arrangement.

Does anyone have any advice as to how to engage management regarding this? I'm trying to be a team player, but I don't exactly have the means do make it work without accomodations on their part. And I don't know if it's smart to go back to the office without endangering my elderly relatives.

I am 20 hours a week, my wife is 40 hours a week. Our computer usage requires placing and answering customer and internal phone calls, and lots of emailing and accessing company servers. Whether that information pertains to any response, I don't know, but figured I'd throw it in.

Starting Monday in the midst of COVID-19 outbreak,"I'm starting a new job on Monday.  The offer is signed, background check cleared, etc etc.  My state just called for all non-essential employees to work from home for the foreseeable future.  The college I adjunct at is closed, effective immediately.   My husband is working from home right now due to a medical condition that makes him super vulnerable to COVID-19.

How do I broach working from home with my new employer before I even start? Should I even say anything? I thought about sending an e-mail asking about their contingency plan and explaining my husband's condition, but I don't want to be ""that person"" and send up red flags.

My new job could be done remotely once the setup is in place, but I expected to ask for that in the summer once they were confident in my work.  HELP!

EDIT: I sent an e-mail asking about their plans and got a response back almost immediately.  (It's a healthcare company, I would have no patient interactions).  They sent me all their COVID-19 details and were VERY understanding of the situation.  At this point I will be going in on Monday, but they are preparing to have me (and everyone who can) WFH immediately if the situation changes."
How do I request work from home from a political company / manager that doesn’t support it?,"Long story short, I work at a huge company (multiple offices globally), in the IT department so we already have laptops with VPN. Every single other partner company has closed down their offices and had their employees work remotely. Also, every single department in the building except for ours is now working from home. 

Finally, today our CEO emailed us and told us that we can work from home, as long as we get a thumbs up from our manager. 

My coworker asked her manager if she can work from home, and her manager said no. But the reason was that her manager doesn’t believe in the coronavirus and says that unless she is sick, she still has to come to work.

Basically, only a handful of us (the only people who work under this manager) are still coming to work because of this reason. Everyone else in the entire building is working from home.

I want to ask my manager to work from home tomorrow, but I am also afraid he will say no. 

I’m terribly afraid ill get infected (Im in my 20s but have underlying health conditions and no health insurance). How can I maneuver this political situation and ask to work from home?"
"Has ""faking it till you make it"" gone too far?","I personally feel like Corporate America has become overly focused on rewarding who can be the best narcissist and con artist, and it's hurting workplace performance, integrity, morale, and those who are more honest with themselves and those around them.

The fact is that a lot of us, even those of us who are experienced, are figuring things out as we go.  Secondly, no two jobs or organizations are the same, so finding a perfect segue from one job to another is nearly impossible.  To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  

As someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.  Furthermore, I see people in positions that they should never be in, simply because they were better at selling the lies about where they're genuinely at with regards to skills and experience.  Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  

In contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.  Furthermore, it'd help morale and productivity on teams because then you're not dealing with the repercussions of a manager or colleague who is out of their element trying to *fake it till they make it*.   

What are your thoughts?  Has faking it till you make it gone too far in the sense that it creates an environment where the best con artist wins out, and then everyone else is forced to deal with the consequences of a poor hiring decision when there are no formal training or mentor programs in place to accommodate?

What do you think of shifting schedules? I’d like to hear your opinions.,"(Is this the right flair?)

I applied for this position as an Investor Communications Specialist (ICS) for a multinational print and digital communications company. The pay is high, but it requires shifting schedules every 1/2/3 months; basically, there is a day shift, night shift, and graveyard shift. I am really inclined to work as an ICS because the responsibility as one interests me, and the company is dynamic and flexible. (They immediately bought laptops for their employees for them to work from home.) My only problem is the shifting schedules.

TL;DR: interesting role, high salary, generous company BUT shifting schedule.

What do you think?"
should i quit my new job after 2 months?,"Recently started a new job. Its been almost 2 months. Its a mid senior level position in supply chain. The training has been minimal, the workload insane where i am spending 8 hours on the weekend trying to catch io. My boss is never available when i have questions. He expects me to figute it out on my own. I am really stressed and really dont like the culture of the company. Probation period ia 6 months long and i dont feel i will pass probation.

There is a position opening at a friends company. The role would be a bit less pay, a bit more junior but the company is great he said. I applied to that role and really thinking of taking it if i get an offer.

How bad would it be quitting after 2 months? I really dont think im a good fit for thie company and role."
Staying calm while on the phone for customer service in a new job?,"Got a new job I’m really loving and doing well at. 

But, I do have to answer the phone and take orders for customers/track shipments/answer questions and I have a hard time doing work like this over the phone. I messed up an order today, and I feel guilty adding any stress to anyone’s day. I know I’m still new, but I would like to remain calm and not get anxious when I’m on the phone with our clients. The company has also been around 20+ years, so the clients know when you mess up pretty quickly. Any advice?"
Possibly toxic work environment?,"I just started a new job and it’s my third day. My boss has exhibited some irrational and unexpected behavior already and I’m wondering if I should call it quits and get back on the job search or stick it out and try to make it work, especially since we’re in a pandemic. He’s been criticizing me for not being what he expected and says that I should be grateful to him for hiring me during a pandemic and that my field is maybe not right for me. I feel like this is irrational because it’s only my third day. He said in thirty days he’ll decide to keep me on or to let me go. Should I try to shape up or is this a big enough red flag to just jump ship? This is only my first job out of college and so I’m uncertain about next steps."
Tips for new hire starting work from home?,"I am 2 weeks into my first job at an MNC fresh out of university. 

While I count my blessings to be able to find a job during this period, I’ve been working from home since day 1 and it poses quite a bit of ambiguity. For example, I can’t read my colleagues/manager’s tone over the chat so the social anxiety in me is slightly freaking out. In addition, the other newcomer in the same role has 4 years of experience whereas I am the only fresh grad in the team. 

I also can’t socialise with them WFH so it’s hard to build relationships with the team.

Would love to hear any tips for this situation or just new hire/first job related ones! Thanks."
Back with previous employer after name change,"After a couple years away and retraining, I've been hired back by a previous employer.

The issue is that I started using my middle name in the meantime. Any other jobs I introduced myself as MiddleName, however they know me by my first name. They contacted me to offer me the job on my old email, and given the current situation it's a great offer. At first I thought I'd cope with it, since for example my family refuses to budge, however I really dislike my first name (there's a reason I changed in the first place).

How do I have that conversation with management? How much reason do I need to give for the name change, or can I get away with ""I'd appreciate if you made the effort to use my second name""? Knowing that for a part of the process I still used my old/first name."
"PLEASE HELP, I hate my job more then I've hated anything ever before","so I need to finish college, and don't wanna go into debt. so I picked up a second job which within 6 pay periods has accumulated enough money for me to pay for the remainder of my undergrad. 

my Major is Cyber Security and Data Assurance. 

Currently I have a job as a threat analyst this job pays for my monthly expenses though so there is little I can save, meaning in order to be able to afford college will take ages. 

&#x200B;

I have no family which can help. I picked up a early day shift for doTERRA which is by far a terrible company, I'm honestly having a moral dilemma working for them. I'm only Customer Service for Northern Europe because I speak the Languages that they require.

So what do I do, should I just suck it up? or what kind of jobs should I look for I need them to pay a minimum of 18/hr preferably early in the morning."
Heading back to toxicity,"I’m in a unique position here and need some help..

I started a paralegal job (after 3 years in the field) at a firm one month prior to this whole corona ordeal. So after one month I got laid off. I collected unemployment and was making more money with that. Now the job wants me back on July 6th. But the problem is the place is very toxic. I’m talking cliques, high turn over rate, unhealthy managers, not the position I applied for, list goes on. On top of all the the commute is one hour each way with traffic and $8 per day in tolls, and only a salary of $45 in the NYC region. I really don’t want to go back - what should I do? It’s not even that I make more money, it’s more so the toxic environment. I remember how miserable I was. I can’t go back to my old job either."

Ghosted after receiving an offer and tentative start?,"I recently graduated this past spring and was incredibly fortunate to land a great job in the midst of COVID. However, after completing the necessary steps (background, drug test, etc) I have not heard from the employer in over a month. My offer was contingent on successfully completing those steps. I'm trying to be understanding and recognize that the world did collectively get rocked by the pandemic, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pretty disappointed with how the company (which is huge and very well known btw) is handling onboarding. I'm still interviewing and applying for jobs because at this point I don't really feel like I have a job. I'm super curious: has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?"
"Just got hired at a new full time job and keeping my part time job, but there is a conflict in schedules, don't know whether to bring this up to my new job."," My current part time job is the one I've had for 4 years now, management likes me, my coworkers like me, it's the office job I had through university and it paid well as a student. This job is an administrative job with the ministry of health so not like there is a conflict of interest between the 2 jobs. I just graduated nursing school and landed a job as a public health nurse and it pays double what I'm getting at my part time job but it's specific to COVID response and therefore the job is temporary, probably lasting a few months. I think this would be a great opportunity for me and would hate to give it up because of a few scheduling conflicts. It would look great on my resume and would allow me to make a good amount of money for a few months. Whereas my part time job pays way less but has been my stable job I've been able to pay rent off of and live pretty frugally with.

There are a lot of scheduling issues with the new job as they have scheduled me Sunday-Thursday 10am-6pm with Friday and Saturday off, and my part time job is usually Tuesday & Friday 4-8pm with alternating weekends. I've been able to speak to some coworkers and get them to cover me on some days and weekends but there is one reoccuring weekly shift the Tuesday 4-8 at my part time job that I'm not able to get covered, and I can't just show up 3 hours late to my shift, so asking my current manager to compromise isn't even an option I think.

So I'm thinking my only option is to speak to the new manager and ask them if I can be changed to the 8-4 shift just on Tuesdays so I can rush to my 2nd job. In the job offer they stated my schedule was fixed and that I had to work all the offers but I'm wondering if there may be some flexibility to that. I'm afraid I might come off as being uncooperative or difficult having just been a new hire and I'm scared of jeopardizing my contract with them or having them let me go. They hired 15 other nurses as well.

I'm getting mixed advice from different people. Some people are telling me it's best to be honest from the get go and let the new job know about my scheduling issues and that I've tried my best to resolve them with my other job but am having difficulty with this one day every week and that this would be easier to figure out from the start rather than wait till after orientation and bring it up 2 weeks after starting. And some people are telling me this could come off as me not being dedicated to this new job and that I'm being difficult and would leave a bad impression to the point they would let me go, or that it looks bad that I', working a party time job ontop of this. Quitting my part time job is not an option as I need this after my contract ends with my new one. I really need some advice about what to say to the new job and when I should say it, or if it's even a good idea to say anything. I didn't indicate there might be a scheduling issue with my interview with HR on the phone because I was afraid they would pass me up if I let on there may be scheduling issues. I start tomorrow. Thank you in advance!

TL; DR: Just got a new second job with scheduling conflicts with my current part time job, wondering how to approach new job about changing the timing of 1 weekly shift despite already been given a fixed schedule."
Joining the same company as my girlfriend,"I am graduating college next week and fortunately have maintained my job offer starting in June despite the pandemic.

Our company is large but privately owned. We will be working in the same headquarters with 2000 employees, but in completely separate divisions and roles.

Struggling on new job. Quit or terminated?,"I need your advice and suggestion on navigating this tough situation my gf currently facing.

She has recently certified as Lpn and interviewed for a job. She had been working as medical assistant for last 3 years.Out of 2 job offers she picked the clinic option where she works 8-5. Other job offer was at the hospital with shifts. 

Now she is in her new job over a month now and training for it. Due to covid situation, clinic visits have become Tele medicine appointments and she needs to handle all phone calls constantly with patients. She is comfortable with handling patients face to face and providing hands-on service to them. Phone conversations and taking notes is difficult for her as English is not her first language. She is taking more time to perform her job. Supervisor is complaining that training period is Over and still my gf is not ready for the job.

Need help drafting an email - issue with fingerprinting,"  
Hi guys, I could really use some help with this situation (see below for details):

I got a job in a different city (from where I am currently located) which starts at the end of July. I received the offer at the end of April, and was told that it is conditional upon completing fingerprints. I then received a revised offer letter (in May) stating that although the employment is conditional on the fingerprints , if they aren't able to complete them in time, the start date would still be the same but ""continued employment"" is dependent on this.

I was asked to provide location preferences as to where I will be working as there are multiple site locations (it is a school). I still do not know where I will be working. I followed up about this over 2 weeks ago and they apologized and said they would be in touch the next week with more information... But they never sent more information. I am not sure how pushy I should be given that at this point no one knows whether schools will re-open in the Fall.

I just got an email on Friday saying that I need to schedule my fingerprints in the next 2 weeks. I just checked and the fingerprinting place in the city I am living now doesn't offer the service I need (yes, there are some like 40 miles away but I also am not comfortable going at the moment because I am living w/ elderly parents). I checked today and the fingerprinting sites in the city where the job is located are open... I ideally do not want to move before I know where I will be working.

I am not sure how to handle this.  Should I follow up with the person who sent the fingerprinting info and ask if I can get my fingerprints done right before the start date instead of in 2 weeks ?

The email also said: If you have any questions, please email {email address}... does this mean I should email or should I try calling? If email, what should I say in the email? I am worried that if I don't handle this the right way they will take away the offer. Thanks"
Question about pre-employment drug test,"I was offered and accepted a job, but have to take a pre employment drug screening, and attend a physical. 

The drug screening and physical are this Tuesday. And I am going to be at a small get together with some family.

My question is, if I drink at this get together am I going to have my offer rescinded?

I am from the US, Ohio specifically. Thanks in advance!"
Will current employer disclosure that I am on FMLA and STD leave during an employment verification?,"I am on FMLA and STD leave from my current employer, and managed to secure a job offer elsewhere. This is critical for my health as the current workplace is very toxic.

I was just informed that even though they already checked references, there is an employment verification check. It says they will contact my current employer for verification so, ""please take measures in preparation.""

Will my current employer disclose to the employment verification provider that I am currently on FMLA   and STD (short-term disability) leave? Will the employment verification provider tell my current employer that this is part of an onboarding process elsewhere?

The employment verification provider is ESR - employment screening resources. Thank you!!"
Remote Job requesting I send I9 over email,"Hello, so a recruiter is requesting I send an i9 form over email. From my knowledge this is insecure, however I know the  recruiting agency is reputable. I'm worried about my SSN leaking as a result, additionally they are requesting I send my DL and Social Security Card. The job is entirely remote. My sister is employed under this company, so I know it is a legitimate company but I am seriously concerned over sending personal information over email.

Anyone have any advice on how to approach this? I don't want to say something and lose this job opportunity, I already completed the background check and have this last ""onboarding"" process to do.

EDIT: I did a little more research into the job itself, I know for 100% fact this offer is real now. But, I still question the security of emailing my personal information."
Is it weird that HR/my supervisor hasn’t reached out to me about my internship ending?,"Hi,

Accepted job - drug test?,"Hello! I’ve recently accepted a job and I start (remotely) tomorrow and they haven’t said anything about drug testing yet. Does this mean I’m most likely in the clear or should I continue to abstain as they might spring it on me once we all go back to work in office? 

Dont they have to tell you that they drug test before you accept the job? This is in New York State (but not city). Only worried about THC, but I’ve been abstaining so far just in case."
What happens if a employer posts a job that is not vacant,I applied to USPS and got a conditional job offer 2 months ago. Today I asked what was taking so long as I have still not started work. They responded that my position has not been vacated yet. They should said they will let me know when they will be moving forward. I guess I have never heard of someone posting a position that is not vacant. What happens if a employer posts a job that is not vacant?
Dismissed misdemeanor on background check?,"An incident occurred a few years ago and I got cited on two charges by the police, no arrest. I was stupid and young, it was something relatively small. I showed up in court where they agreed on me to do a diversion program where my charges would be dismissed at the end of the period. 

I was wondering, does a dismissed misdemeanor show up on background checks and if it does, what happens with the employer? Will they give you a chance to explain the situation and perhaps give me a chance at the job or will they reject me upright? I've never applied to a full-time job and haven't been through extensive background checks.

I finished college a year ago and am now looking for full time jobs relating to my degree and thus going through the process of background checks once I get offers. I haven't yet had the case expunged as it is a lengthy process and will try to get it expunged asap but would like to know if anyone knows how a dismissed misdemeanor will affect my chances getting hired right now.

I've searched on Google and most of the cases have arrests being made, but in my case I wasn't arrested, just confronted by police and given a citation."
Laborer to Corporate Level,"Doing an Interim job... from Laborer to Corporate. 

I just want to know is it normal in a Corporate job to constantly stay busy? No lunches, trying to find new ideas everyday.  3 conference calls at once, etc. 

I just understand how anyone can be productive with all this crap going on at once.

I understand being busy, but constantly scattered and try to prove myself that I'm good at what I do or always being questioned how I would like to grow and develop every week... is getting old.

Maybe I'm just overwhelmed.  My old job was a cake walk... go into work get my assignments and go to town. Still sucked though... toxic environment.. long hours.. no sleep. I left to go to a more professional career and increase pay... I might have messed up or I just haven't found what I enjoy.

Idk... still lost in my 40's lol.."
"At a new job, I have lots of downtime because people are too busy to train me, and am not sure what to do/how to stay productive","I've been at my current job for about a month, I work remotely and due to current circumstances other teammates and my manager are too busy to give me a proper training schedule. Out of a 40 hour week, I maybe get 10 hours of training.

My manager told me that my training would be primarily be two teammates because the work I am to take on is currently their responsibility. I reach out to them a few times a week and they go over things with me via conference callls and screen sharing. They are good teachers and I have been learning a decent amount about how to do my job, but I still have *lots* of down time. I understand that I am not going to be babysat all day, but I have nothing to do. 

I poke around in the various dashboards/spreadsheets that we use all day, but there is only so much of that that I can do. I've asked about things I should be reviewing and they just point me back to those items I was already looking at. I also try to listen in on as many relevant conference calls as I can to just absorb more information, but that has limited value as well given how green I am in this role (my previous job was completely different, I made a lateral move).

Just recently I got to set some quarterly goals with manager (he hasn't reviewed them yet) so I'm hoping he'll get back to me about that and can give me some more guidance...

In the mean time what should I be doing? How can I ask for more to do without being annoying to my manager/teammates? I like this company and this is a job I want to do."
Delayed start due to onboarding procedures - did I mess up?,"I’m a nervous wreck worrying my job offer will be rescinded. I signed the offer 2 weeks ago and am now trying to complete onboarding stuff. 

I had to complete some physical assessments and get labs done. I realized that I hadn’t been offered one of the tests although I had discussed it with employee health and safety. I notified EHS of this immediately, hoping my start date would not be delayed. When I went in to do the test, and they told me I need to get  a vaccine due to my lab results, which I can’t do until after my planned start date. I spoke to my manger about delaying my start date a few days and received an email from HR today confirming the delay. Does this reflect badly on me? I’m not sure if this is my fault or just EHS being slow during the coronavirus. 

Another issue - made an error on my BG check (listed a company’s name and phone # instead of a reference on the app). Asked BG company if they could update the reference and they said yes, but they ended up marking it as unable to complete. A long time intermittent independent contracting position I have also showed up as unable to complete. Is this going to screw me even worse? I can easily explain both incompletions and provide proof, but HR hasn’t mentioned it yet. Should I bring it up?"
Will disclosing disabilities affect me in corporate?,"TW: sexual assault/mental health

I have dealt with an anxiety disorder for many years now, along with mild PTSD from my sexual assault, and I would like to know if disclosing this will affect me in my corporate life. 

I was given an optional form where I can disclose these kinds of disabilities, and although it states that disclosing this information will not subject me to differential treatment, I would just like to know if this is just for HR's records or if it will realistically negatively affect my position at the company. I am already very closed-off on speaking about my mental health issues and past trauma with close friends, so I feel even more reluctant about speaking about it in a professional setting.

If anyone has had this kind of situation, please let me know if you disclosed and if anything happened! 

Thank you!"
How long into a new job until you feel like you are up to speed?,"I started a new job on Monday, and I am incredibly happy and thankful even without the current COVID19 situation. I was laid off at my other job in Feb due to restructuring, and I landed this job just in time and they are paying me $30,000 more per year than the company I left.

It has elevated my financial situation to a place I didn't dream of being until my 30s (I'm mid 20's right now). That being said, I want to make sure I do the best job I can so I don't lose it.

Problem is, I don't yet actually know what I'm actually going to ""do"" at my job. The first 3 days have just been sitting in on meetings to get a feel of the culture and how departments interact. As far as I can tell, on a basic level, my job is order fulfillment/prioritization/demand planning. I have 5 years experience so I understand a lot of the context of what people are talking about in these meetings, I just don't know what I'll actually be doing on my own say 6 months from now.

Do you experience this when you start a new job? Kind of has a 'fake it till you make it feel'"
"I was just hired with the county and having in-person onboarding and training tomorrow, but as my luck would have it I have started to not feel well. Can they rescind their job offer if I tell them I am sick and need to reschedule?","I have a feeling they would not just fire me over being sick, especially with the state of current affairs. But I really want this job and am super paranoid they will not want to wait the 2 weeks if I need to quarantine. Obviously I will not risk getting others sick just for a job but am looking for some words of encouragement that they won't fire me."
Surving new job with barely any trainint,"So i started a new job 2 weeks ago  and really so far the training has been veey poor. They pretty much expect me to figure out everything on my own. I was already supposed to finish a little project for today and couldnt because there ie so much to do and really struggling. Its a very project based analytical role  Sometimes i ask my boss on certain things and he doesnt know either, he redirects me to someone else. They gave a bunch of really big excel files and pretty much trying to figure out everything on my own.

Anyhow, last job i had i quit after 3 months without a new one lined up because really hating what i was doing. I do not want to go through that again.

Any tips? Really worried i will get fired. The workload is also insane. Getting sick and tired of companies to providing adequate training."
How to gain back confidence after being fired twice in a row?,"So this whole situation started late 2018 when i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression, after i was given an offer for a really good opportunity to work at an highly respected company to start Jan 2019.

When i started the job i disclosed my mental illness at the time as this company gave the impression that they care about their employees mental health, and that they had a number of mental health ambassadors around so if someone needed to talk they could have a chat with one of them. This obviously appealed to me at the time as i felt as though i could be open... boy was i completed wrong.

Things started to hit the fan only a few days into this job where my manager caught me crying outside the office, and she told me that i was not capable of this position and that they needed someone strong to be in this position and it was a highly pressured role dealing with various reports and having meetings with senior managers and directors. Now her response did take me back, so i plead with her to give me a chance and that i can make this work.

Now to cut a long story short here my manager was micromanaging me as this was her first time being a manager so i figured she didn’t know how to manager due to being inexperienced. So i carried on doing what I’m doing and then she started becoming hostile and shouting at me for things like spelling issues, fonts not right and not cleaning the email mailbox. 
Now to be honest my mental health through this got worst as i was making mistakes but i felt i could not concentrate as my manager was always on my back making me feel more nervous, and at times every task i would do i felt i would have to run it past her just to see if i was doing the work to her standard. But all this came to backfire on me as i was fired at the end of my probation and one of the major feedback points were that i did not take initiative and that i felt everything i do had to be audited

The second job i started this year in January and from the start i noticed that manager that was trying to train me wasn’t clear in her expectations of what i was supposed to be doing in the role and i found my self having to ask her over and over what i needed to be doing. Once i started getting an hang on what i was supposed to be doing she would say things like ‘ i didn’t say, if you remember i said’ but the thing is i was documenting everything she said and i even told her this but she claimed she could not recall her saying anything i told her she said. So during my time at this job i noticing more and more that my manager backtracks on everything that she says, its almost like she has amnesia and also she would say small things that would offend me like ‘I’m not a senior as I’m not doing senior work’ but when i would ask her for specifics she was say ‘well your a senior you should already know, and its not my job to tell you your job’ so after this i reported her to her manager as at the time i didn’t want to speak to HR yet and her manager advised me that he will go to HR on my behalf and obviously that backfired and i was let go about 3 weeks after that 

Now prior to these two jobs i had a really good career and done my job at an excellent level according to previous employers and coworkers. But I’m not gunna lie these last two jobs really took a hit at my confidence and it had make me question my competency in my career. I realised that the problems at these two roles were me and managers jointly. So during the quarantine i have been doing different courses and researching materials online with relation to my role and to also improve my mental health so that i try and gain back the confidence lost, however i cant help these negative thoughts about not succeeding in my next role. Like what if i get a manager that doesn’t train properly or once that micromanages how do i at least survive probation.

Some advice would be greatly appreciated"
"I completed on-boarding, but cannot get in contact with anyone about a start date?","Hi everyone. I accepted a healthcare position at a temporary site for the pandemic. I have completed and passed all CORIs, completed all onboarding modules through the overarching company/hospital, been given login information for their systems, and even have access to view and add myself to the schedule. However, I have attempted to contact two different individuals in HR who have been sending emails throughout the hiring process, and no one has answered.   

I replied to person 1's email last thursday looking for clarifications and with questions. No answer. 

I replied to person 2's email on Monday immediately after they sent it as it mentioned information about other people having already completed orientation, looking for clarifications and information about starting. No answer.    

I called person 2 on Tuesday and left a voicemail explaining I have completed hiring paperwork and was looking to speak to someone about next steps. No answer.   

On Wednesday I sent a direct email to person 1 as opposed to replying to a thread. No answer.   

I understand it might look like I am being a pain in the rear end, but if this was for a regular job and not a pandemic position that Ive already been clearly hired for and have access to everything, Id patiently wait. But the fact I have access to the schedule (which says do not put yourself on until you've oriented), I have no idea what to do.   

Im going to just wait it out now, but does that seem like the right move? Do I try calling again?"
New job is going great but a person on my team let me in on some “inside info” on my boss.,"This guy seems like he’s a genuine and very good person, however he told me he’s likely to be fired over the next few months. He told me on a phone call:

1. My boss is super passive aggressive and doesn’t get along with other managers.

- I haven’t really seen this in the 5 weeks I’ve been here. She’s been helpful, seems to get along with others. However, I have noticed a couple passive aggressive remarks. Again, nothing when looked at on a whole.

2. Isn’t a good manager of people.

- I looked into this and mr predecessor was only in my position 3 weeks before she fired him. The girl before him lasted a year before she left(don’t know if she was fired). My coworker said she hasn’t managed him well and threw him to the wolves. 

-From my experience she’s been helpful, complimentary, supportive and there for me. Went out of her way to get me started remotely, a great relocation package and on payroll with everything going on.

I found out this coworker received a warning letter for his inappropriate and unacceptable behavior but don’t have details. He does seem like a good person though... what would you do with all this info?"

Is no job training a red flag?,"I had an interview with a company, and at the location I'm working at I will be the only person in that department. Everyone else on my ""team"" will be remote from other offices around the world.

Feeling Stressed after 2 weeks of “Training”,"Hi everyone. So I recently got my first job in the tech industry as technical support agent  and at first I was excited thinking this would be a good stepping stone in software development. However my first two weeks of training consisted of word doc where I answered questions about the said product I am helping people with and mock cases to answer.  

The Word document gave me links to read that were either dead or didn’t help answer the questions at all. Whenever I brought this up to my supervisor I was just told “ to go figure it out” and my co-workers were often busy and can’t help me as much. The mock cases didn’t even cover what I learned in the Word Doc and I was somewhat scolded that I was taking so long to figure them. I’m just feeling defeated and they told me that I won’t be getting cases anytime soon because I’ve been so slow. I’m not sure what to do here, should I just suck it up and work extra hard to get things correctly or maybe look for some other job I would be suited better for?"

Got a new job but have questions about dress code?,"I just got a job at a local, kinda ritzy hotel, and I was told the dress code for my position is business professional, and we wear suits/ties daily. When I interviewed, I was told uniforms would be provided, but I wasn’t interviewing for this particular position. I’m 18 and I don’t own a suit, so I don’t know what I am going to wear when I start on Monday. I tried contacting the lady who emailed me but I haven’t heard back. We are going into the weekend so I don’t know if I will.  I’m not sure what to wear....?

While looking online, I found that the male employees have to have, short professional hair, off collar, off ears. I have longish hair, but this never came up in the interview. Should I get a haircut for Monday?"
Waited over 1/2 hour for a first day no show,"I showed up to my first day at a new job, waited half an hour (technically 50 minutes because I showed up twenty minutes early) while I called, rang their comm, e-mailed...and then ended up leaving. The owner invited me back to start working at 12 pm but I decided to not take the roll in the end because I have an uneasy feeling about this place (and this experience didn't help). This has never happened to me in my entire professional career so I was just curious to see if something similar has ever happened to any of you and how you handled the situation."
"Impostor syndrome, or is it just that I’ve been misjudged in giving that job?","I have just started a new job 3 weeks ago, in which I feel hugely out of my depth. Now, I’m no rookie, I have been working in this field (higher education) for the last 20 years, but I feel I have no idea how to do this new job! I have worked in the UK, in mainly successful or very successful universities, in administrative roles (exams, paperwork of any sort, meetings, daily life, lectures timetable...etc) I have now started in a tiny (50 students total) private uni in Europe. This organisation has no money (website is on a free site, marketing budget for the year barely covers the minimum requirement: we have limited supply of brochures, which are needed to advertise!, only 2 of us in marketing and recruitment -my new title- money for 1 international student fair and about 10 in the year in Europe). Basically, compared to the budget/reputation I worked at in the UK, it’s maybe 5% of what I knew... so, restrictive is not even the word. To compound my feelings of going nowhere, I have been given a marketing and recruitment role (managing one other person doing just marketing -he’s young and good at it, but scattered in his approach and his English needs reviewing a lot), while I have zero experience in marketing and as for recruitment, I used to attend students fair about 10 times a year, but never really thought about it too seriously, because we weren’t really begging for students to enrol. In this role, I’m expected to have concrete results, with no tools or skills to do the job!! I feel so inadequate! My partner says it’s typical to feel this way after 3 weeks, that I need to structure my day in researching things, that I have imposter syndrome, but because I’m hard working (already done 5 hours extra that I need to get back -not that I think I’ll be able to, because I’m so busy all day... but not actually doing anything of substance). Basically I’m unprepared in my method, because I don’t know what I am supposed to do! I think ‘I cannot sell the program with such a crap website’, so I go and try and improve it, it takes 4-5 hours and is marginally better after that, but then, it’s still not great. Then I research potential partnerships with other universities (so they could maybe send students to us for a semester or two), but I have no idea how to approach them formally, what to suggest, even if they’d laugh at the idea... Again, my partner says you could just try and see, you lose nothing, but I think I may lose a good opportunity by just suggesting something random and ridiculous. I recently contacted someone who organised a ‘concerting’ of universities for quality purpose, but she immediately dismissed me, as we’re nit of the caliber she’s after. Basically, I do not know HOW to go about things... at all... and it somehow paralyse my every attempt. I research things to death, and I waste time, faff and don’t achieve much... I know it’s been 3 weeks, but again, I haven’t managed to secure one meeting with an international school nearby (as it’s a program offered in English, in Belgium). Is it me, or was I totally mis-judged and wrongly chosen for the job... any advice?"
"New job, business professional dress code?","Just got a new job with a consulting firm in Dallas. I start in two weeks. The onboarding documents state that the dress code is business professional, ie suit and tie. Although everyone I saw while interviewing left the jackets off.

Does anyone have some wardrobe suggestions that will get me through the first few weeks until my first paycheck at least? I just graduated in December so I’m still on a tight student budget.

Also I have fairly long hair, which I kept tied back in the interviews. I never really pressed the issue but should I just go ahead and cut it to something more clean cut and professional?"
How and when do you usually receive your schedule (retail)?,"About two weeks ago, I was hired at Burlington. I was told that I would receive my schedule during onboarding/orientation. Well, orientation was a couple of days ago, and I did not get a schedule. Instead, we were told to come to a different location on the 12th and 13th for what I think is going to be training, and they are sending people to different locations all over the city. 

Is this normal? When and how should I expect to receive my schedule? Should I ask my manger when I go for training, or would that come off as pushy? I’m getting a little nervous because I need to figure out transportation times and costs since I rely on the bus, and I also want to make sure there’s no miscommunication so I don’t miss work before I even officially started."

First Day Experience,"So, my first two days at work have been...interesting.

During college, I was at an internship that started off great. When new management came in, I left with the thought ""nothing can be this bad.""

Well, there's competition. On my very first day, and even more on the second day, I learned that nearly everyone talks about everyone else. Im pretty sure something was even said about me as two coworkers were whispering, and made eye contact with me when they looked back to see if I was listening. Then they started writing notes (lol). Even the one of the two that were gossiping in that instance, came back to me and talked about the other person. Im just trying to keep my head down and mind my business. Thing is, this is my first full-time role so I dont really have any other options. Anyone else have similar experiences?"
"Accepted life changing job, must pass a hair follicle drug test","Hello everyone, thanks in advance for any advice given.  

I’ve accepted a position that forces me to relocate two plus hours away. Issue is, I have to pass a hair follicle drug test as part of the onboarding process. 

I was a daily smoker of cannabis, after work and weekends, never during work hours. I last smoked on October 14th. During my acceptance, I said I could be ready to go on January 6th, this was before I knew it would be a hair test as opposed to a urine test. 

I do have a plan to beat the test, and would like some advice on my plan, as well as any other advice. 

I’ll let my new employer know that the earliest I can terminate a current lease is the end of January., then I’ll need about a week to find a place, moving my start date out a month. This will be way over 90 days after I quit smoking cannabis. I should be clean by January 19th, if my math is correct. 

Do you think that will work? Or does anyone have any other advice so I can finally work my way back out of poverty."

Onboarding email from company that asks for PII without job offer?,"The email says "" We are pleased to inform that you’ll be confirmed as Tableau Consultant once you provide the following details""

I gave the recruiter a call and told her I don't feel comfortable giving information over email and she says I am welcome to come into their office and hand over the documents.

My question is, what company would ask you for this information without a formal job offer first? Should I call her back and ask for a job offer first? Could this be a scam?"
Bringing cupcakes on my first day of work?,"Hi! Nervous about my first day of work tomorrow. Would it make me too much of a suck up to bring in treats on my first day? My interviewers were very kind, especially HR. Would it be bad to give them vegan cupcakes? There’s a specialty shop that I love."

I'm working within Supply Chain and a very big corporation which is what I also majored in. The only thing I've learned and improved is mostly excel based, I haven't gotten a chance to really work on my SCM and analytical skills as most of my work as been report based or doing sidework + creating excel files from scratch.  


This is normal right? For a first job? I understand that I'm starting all the way at the bottom and I need to earn my role - but I just want to hear maybe what your first jobs were like. Do things really start moving once I hit my 2nd job after a year or two? Thanks!"

New job - correct way to update Linkedin?,"I'm in the first week of work with a job title that includes the word ""Student"" (let's say, for the sake of anonymity, that the job title is ""Student Office Assistant""). This is because it's designed to be flexible and part-time so that someone who is studying can work there at the same time. However, being a student is not actually a requirement; I am a graduate.

I feel it may be confusing to others if I update my Linkedin to being a ""Student Office Assistant"" when I'm not actually a student. But at the same time, it might seem wrong to change my job title to one that I don't actually have.

As a compromise, I was considering putting in my full job title under the experience section (""Student Office Assistant - Amazon). And then, for the headline, I could write ""Office Assistant at Amazon"". Does that seem reasonable?"

What are some tips on transitioning into a new office and not making foolish mistakes?"
Did I just ruin my chances of getting a job by asking a stupid question?,"Hey all, I had a final round interview for a company today in Illinois, a state that recently legalized weed.

I am a huge pot head and I am worried about the drug test. In one of the sections of the interview process, we were put in a room to have an informal lunch with people who are in The position I want. I am very young, 22, and this is an entry level role, most people I was tai g to were 23 or 24.

I wanted to figure out about the drug test, so I started talking to this one girl that worked there, asked her basic questions about the company what she does, and after we hit it off a little I slipped in a question about the drug test. I told her that if I would have to take it within 24 hours of today I would fail because of the recent legalization.

This girl was around 23, and she responded to my question very nicely and gave me the details about the test.

I spoke to my father afterwords and mentioned that I asked a question about the test. He then flipped out at meme, starting cursing, and swearing, and said that was a dumb thing to ask. I felt that she was close enough to my age that it doesn’t matter. He feels there’s no way I’m getting the job now.

What do you guys think? I think it was a harmless question that shell probably forget about. He thinks it was a job ending move.

In hindsight it prob wasn’t the best idea but I don’t think it’ll keep me from getting the job. What do you think?"
"I got hired, but they don't know when they'll schedule me","I applied, interviewed and was hired.  I go on Friday to give them my ss and fill out paperwork.  

They still don't know when I'll be scheduled. It was ""we can't put anymore people on the schedule because of the holiday "" for this week , then ""we're up to our limit for hours next week ""  when they called on Sunday, so it sounds like 3 weeks til I MAYBE start. 

This is only a part time retail thing, but is this a red flag? Should I keep applying? Every other job I had I started within 2 weeks of interviewing, seems weird to hire someone they don't have hours for."
Imposter Syndrome in new job,"So I've recently gotten a management job despite not having much experience in the field (my boss is well aware of it). I've attempted to make a post on that industry's subreddit on how to train myself outside of work to supplement my boss's training and I've received 90% criticism on how I'd even gotten that job and how I should have at least 5 years experience to even try to apply for such job, and it has really demotivated me. Of course I'm going to make advances to try to better myself but that experience definitely gave me some form of imposter syndrome. I'm usually not one to succumb to stress or adversity, but what are y'alls advice/experiences of other people bringing your accomplishments down or people saying you don't deserve what you have?"
I’m beginning a new government job in a court house... looking high as a kite.,"Sooo I am that idiot who wore contact lenses in the pools/ocean on my vacation last week in Miami. I gave myself the hands down WORST eye infection I think I’ve seen... in both eyes. I’m no longer contagious it just looks so much worse than it is right now. 

I called my eye doctor Monday morning and he called me in some really potent antibiotic eye drops which helped to an extent but symptoms were also coming back while on them. My eye doctor prescribed oral antibiotics on top of it on Thursday. 

Since using both antibiotics, I feel much much much better. I look *slightly* better - my eyes are still very very red. Needless to say, I look extremely high. 

I normally wouldn’t care about how my eyes look but on Monday, I begin my new job that’s a government position, in a courthouse. NOT a good look, at all. 

I’m praying that I look normal by Monday but it’s not looking like the redness will be completely gone. How do I go about explaining/handling this? 

I’m going to bring my medications with me and explain it to my boss/HR but the rest of the people I encounter.... I almost want to put a sign on my shirt haha."
When to expect Internship background check?,"Hello, I accepted my summer internship offer on November 11. I got the obligatory ""Welcome to company"" email on November 18 that gives you the graphic to post on Linkedin to post regarding your new job. However, I still haven't been contacted regarding the background check, which my offer says it is contingent upon. Should I keep looking for internships while I wait for this to be cleared? Should I ask HR about my background check status? The company is a subsidary of a large company."
Advice on bringing up WFH?,"Got a new job about 3 weeks ago. In my offer the HR Recruiter said I could work from home 3 days a week after 2 weeks in the office. 

On week 3 now and nobody has said anything on setting it up.

 Any advice on how to ask for this without sounding like I  don't want to work. Not everyone in my office has WFH access but was told when I accepted the offer I could.

TIA!"
"I got a call yesterday from the company I interviewed for on Tuesday, and they offered me the position.","Now is the Onboarding process. I verbally accepted the offer on the phone. I had to sign a lot of documents and scan and email them back to Human Resources. I got the paper for the drug test today and I went right away to take it at Labcorp. It’s time sensitive for 48 hours anyways but I wanted to take care of it right away. I don’t have any felonies on my record but I’m wondering isn’t the background check usually done before they offer you the position and not during the on boarding process? 

In the past I always thought that the background check always was done prior to them offering you the job. Am I right or wrong?"
"Working at a big bank, was hired to one team but HR called and said I was moved to another. The new team is pretty out of alignment with my skills and interests, should I talk to my manager?","Some context, I just graduated from a master's program in CS and originally interviewed for this job a few months ago.

So I was hired a few months ago to a big bank as a new hire. I interviewed with a manager and his department seemed really interesting and in line with my previous internships and school. I accepted the offer but a month before starting HR called telling me I'd been moved to a different department that they thought would be a better fit based on my skills.

I spoke with the new manager and it seemed alright, but it's been a week after starting and it's extremely clear the new team is just overworked and needed more people, and the job seems to be maintaining legacy systems even after I graduated with a master's degree, while the old team was working on some more modern stuff that was really in line with my skills.

So my question is, should I bring this up with my new boss even though I've already been here two weeks? How would you bring this up? I'm trying to figure out whether to talk to my current manager, the manager I was originally hired to, or HR. Any advice in general though would be appreciated, thanks in advance!"
is it normal that my company's hr is really unresponsive ?,"I had the interview with company back in Nov 2019, they kept saying the offer was on the way but I didn't get it till January. I get it that they could be slow because their CEO was travelling on Christmas.  But in general their HR is extremely unresponsive. After singing offer, giving information on background check, they told me they will let me know what to do on the first day close to my start date(which is next Monday and 2 business days away). Last week I sent an email to the HR to ask for some updates on background check, no response. By today I haven't heard any thing from them so I called the HR, his phone rang twice and went to voice mail, no call back at all. Now I am just wondering what's happening and I already booked everything.   It is my first job, I wonder if it's normal that HR is like that, and what I can do ?  Thank you!"
"I got the job, why is it taking so long to start?","A bit short of 2 weeks ago I was interviewed and hired, then came back the next day to sign papers, give bank info etc. I was then told it would take time for my papers to process with HR... and I can't start my first day until they've done so. I haven't worked in so long, the wait is making me worried. Are they going to reject me after they already chose me? Did something go wrong with my forms? is this normal?

I really like the environment there and management seems really nice keeping me updated regularly. Anxiety has stopped me from working for years but I want to work here for a long time to improve myself."
Do I tell my references not to mention the most recent job I had quit?,"Hi Reddit,

So I feel like I’m in a pickle right now. This September, I had worked at a company (my first job) for only a week. I left that quickly because I had an incredibly toxic boss (who got fired later... karma lol) and overall I did not see myself thriving in that position. I updated my references (who I had used for that job) about my quitting and the fact that I’m back in the job search.

So last week, I got an offer for my dream job at a different company. I supplied my employer with the same list of references I had used for my previous job. I’ve basically cleared everything in the onboarding process besides the reference check (because all of my references were out of office during the break). The more I wait for the reference check to complete, the more anxious I get about them mentioning my first job (for some random reason)...  I omitted that position from my resume/application and basically told my interviewers that I’ve been searching for jobs and finding myself blah blah blah since I’ve graduated.

So ultimately, my question is, should I ask my references not to mention my previous job during the reference check? If so, how can I phrase it? Thanks so much! I feel like I’m being anxious for no reason and I just need some reassurance."
My first day is tomorrow!,"Tomorrow will be my first day as an HR Technician for my city’s community service board. I like to come in prepared 

can you give me suggestions on what to bring my first day and what questions to ask?

My supervisor called and told me on Monday to come in between 8:30-8:35 am and I will be doing training on the computer most of the day. The following day we would go over benefits and  other employee preparation things. 

Any tips on how to make a good first impression besides my outfit?"
Asking for time off for doctors appointment in a new job,I got a job that I starts the 5th. But I have started to have grip problems in my dominant hand. The problem I think is a pinched or entrapped nerve. I was to see a doctor for it. I also have an annual checkup at a different doctor that I need to do. But how do I go about this? Do I set up the appointments and then just tell them I cant show up on that day? Do I tell them why?
"Got the job. Start in a month, but invited to team holiday outing on Monday. What should I expect?","Hi all. Happy to say, I got a great job after taking a risk and quitting my last job without anything lined up. Last job was hell, but this job seems to be a significant upgrade in responsibility, salary, growth opportunity and benefits. Everything has been signed and submitted and my start date is Jan 15.

While accepting the offer, the team manager invited me to their team holiday outing this year. I enjoyed meeting everyone I met and interviewed with throughout the process so I graciously accepted, but now that its approaching I guess my imposter syndrome is kicking in slightly. 

I'll be meeting and hanging out with the whole team for 3 hours. Dinner and some team building event after. Should I prepare somewhat similar to an interview? I know I wont be expected to know much more than what I learned in the hiring process, abd I doubt I'll get any interview questions like ""what are your weaknesses?"" but a little voice inside me keeps saying I shouldn't go into this thinking it's just a social gathering for me, even though it is for them. I'll be the new stranger.

Any advice? Also the company dress code is pretty casual, but I've been suited up every time I've met with them. What should I wear? My usual casual is band tshirts and Jean's with holes in them. I'm thinking of wearing nicer casual clothes like nice Jean's and a polo.

Any advice or go-to get to know you talking points would be appreciated. I may be over thinking this, but I'd hate to lose the job because I wasnt socially prepared and some higher up forms a bad impression of me for some reason."
Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement?,"So I recently accepted a new job in which I need to sign a Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, of which I've never had to do before. My main concern is that I have been doing some writing in my spare and time and if I ever wanted to publish something outside of work, could the company take ownership of it through this agreement?"
Is there anyone who didn't pass their probation?,"I had a 6 month probation period but in the mid term review they cancelled my probation due to me complaining about a lack of support to the HR. It was an extremely toxic environment and every blame was being put on me since I was a newcomer. Initially I used to bow down to everyone who said it's me who is to be blamed but it was taking a toll on me. One day my manager shouted at me in front of everyone for no reason and I had to go to the HR, after which I was terminated in two weeks. 

The reason they gave me was that I shouldn't have gone to the HR even though I had repeatedly flagged out to my manager regarding a lack of training & support. Now they're claiming money from me that they provided for relocation & a joining bonus. I'm really feeling lost right now being unemployed and I want to know if there's anyone here who has failed the probationary period as well and what you did afterwards to recover. 

Hoping for suggestions. Thanks :)"
Any info about Infosys Associate Position 2020 USA,"I am a non CS graduate (felt as if it was important to mention). I was contacted by a .... from Infosys to apply to their associate role. I am a bit skeptical about reading other comment. 

Anyone know anything about the Associate position at Infosys. I have been reading a lot of concerning comments. What is their starting salary?What exactly does the job requirement entail. How often do people get projects?"
How to feel more comfortable at new job?,"I've been with my current company for almost 2 years now (first company out of graduate school), and switched departments around 3.5 months ago to a slightly different role. I was in my previous role for around 18 months, and left due to a toxic environment, which led to never-ending staff shortages, significantly heavy workload for low pay, etc. My new role was literally created as a new position, as it is considered a ""hybrid"" position to take on 3 different roles between these 2 locations, and offered me slightly more pay than my old job. I also understood that accepting a newly created position could be more challenging, as management is kind of learning how to provide the best supervision/management, as I learn how to make the position more of my own. This management ""learning curve"" has also resulted in several issue that have required mediation between multiple supervisors and directors (which they are supposedly taking responsibility for, and aren't faulting me, but I still feel very uncomfortable about the situation).  Although I am definitely learning a lot more in my new position (I've been doing a lot of self-education outside of work also), I am still feeling super overwhelmed in my new position, and feel inconsistently supported by my supervisors. Most of my coworkers are nice, but I do not feel like I fit in with any of them, as most of them are all 10-40 years older than me, and married with children (which I am not), and just have very different personalities than me, so I sometimes feel even lonelier and more lost at my new job with few people to turn to for advice, etc. I also feel like when I ask questions, these people with more experience appear to sometimes get frustrated for something that seems so ""simple and easy"" to them, but may not be that way for me, as a newer employee. My new department also is very similar to my old department in some ways-it's not as ""toxic"" as my old job, but there are some very opinionated and close-minded colleagues that are also making my job significantly more challenging to complete (which again, my supervisor is aware of, and trying to mediate to the best of her ability, supposedly). I have started looking at other potential jobs, but the job market is very saturated for my profession, so my options are limited. I also worry about leaving so soon, and having other employers potentially believe I am a ""job hopper"", which I know can carry a negative connotation. Has anyone ever experienced something similar at a new job, or have any suggestions to help me feel more comfortable/confident? I have been pushing myself to try and ask more questions when needed, without worrying about what other people think, but am still struggling with feeling like I ""fit in""."
New business wardrobe for start of a new job,"Hi all, this is a little different from the typical post on here, but I thought there would likely be some good thoughts if I were to pick the brains of people on here.

I'm starting a new job starting the second week of December in a Finance Manager position in a university hospital department, and I've decided that I'll go back to wearing a suit and tie for work daily. It's not something I've done since I worked in the wealth management industry a few years back; in my last few roles I've worn semi-casual button-down shirts and khakis, but I think a suit would make a better impression and be more commensurate with the position when meeting with faculty or senior leadership, or if I end up hiring some staff in the future to work under me.

I've got one nice suit from Brooks Brothers which I interviewed in, but I'd like to get a new one (which isn't quite as expensive!) along with a half-dozen shirts--I'm pretty well stocked for ties still. Does anyone have any recommendations of places where I could get a good deal and the suit/shirts are of a decent quality? I've seen some nice suits in *Banana Republic*, and I walk past a *Jos A Bank* daily which always is advertising some good deals.

I figure that on Black Friday weekend too there could be the chance to get a great deal too..."
I'm scared of the full time job I'm about to start soon.,"I start a full time job at a restaurant soon, and it's actually more close to 7~4 so I'll be working a lot. I don't know how I'm going to be able to manage standing such a long time multiple days a week. I don't know how I'm going to have a consistent sleeping schedule. This job isn't even related to my major, so it won't be a job that is going to define my career, so I am not personally excited for it at all. Has anyone ever worked full time at a restaurant before? How did you manage your life outside of work on such a physically demanding job? Seems like all I'll want to do after my shift is to just come home and chill for the rest of the day. Not to mention I'll probably have weekend shifts so all my future plans are ruined."
What is the background check like on/after your first start date?,"On the company's portal, I gave my information, the standard, address, work history, background etc. I was given an offer. I accepted the offer. And then a welcome email stating my first start date.


It seems like they did a background check of some sort. 


My questions:


It is possible for companies to either:


a) did not finish the background check (but want me to start)


b) will CONTINUE the background check even after I start?


Is this practice possible? 


For context: it's worrying because if I quit my current job, and go to new job and say something came up -- they can terminate me and I'm left without a job.


Just curious if anyone seen/heard or have experience with background check when employed?


Thanks"
Employee before me left halfway through their 1st day and never returned. Is this an omen for me?,"Today was the first day at my new job. When I came back from my lunch break one of the guys told me that they were betting to see if I was going to come back or not. This is because the last hire left for his lunch break and never came back. I thought it was weird they even divulged this information to me.

What was so bad that made this guy run for the hills. Is this a sign that the guy saw something that I'm not seeing?

Conflicted on leaving or staying as I'm basically on the fence with the experience I've had."
I think the interviewer tricked me," 

So I got this retail job, I figured it's a good way to earn some extra cash since I'm a full time uni student and want something I can do in summer and keep when uni starts again, BTW I am currently preooccupied with other projects unrelated to work so I don't have much free time

Anyway during the interview I was told I'd get to choose when I can work (which isn't out of the ordinary, most PT jobs here let you pick your times) I let them know about the side projects Im doing and that I won't be available most days of the week, and they said it's fine. I was told I'd get contacted (after I sign my contract) by the store manager so I can let him know my hours.

Long story short, they told me to come in for a full day and I did. The next day (today) I was told my hours for the next week and apparently, they put me in for FOUR whole days, like starting at 9 and finishing at 8pm. I told the store manager that I had a different agreement with the HR lady and she basically shrugged me off and said I need to ''bear'' with her and she ''needs'' me because they're understaffed..

I only agreed to this job because they promised flexible hours! What should I do? Should I tell HR people about this or forget it and keep on searching since they quite obviously tricked me and never even asked me what days I could work, pretty much everything that was promised in the interview was a lie."
Very anxious about starting a new job Tuesday,"So after a very LONG and ridiculous year of job searching, I was finally hired into what I hope to be an excellent job for me in a great location. I’m very happy to have the job, and everyone there is really great, but I’m *so anxious* about starting. Literally everything on the first week agenda gives me anxiety. Even the lunch they are paying for the first couple of days gives me anxiety. It’s killing me. It makes 0 sense because they are such nice people and I know they chose to hire me, but this is just about to kill me. 

Realistically I know I’m very lucky to have this job and I’ll be okay, I can’t quit stressing odd things that can happen between then and now. Starting and then they realize I’m not the person they hired from the interview. Getting into a car wreck or fender bender and not being able to drive the first day, making me late. Me not knowing enough about the job subject and looking like a goon. Me being completely overwhelmed despite the current person holding the job training me for months. Me saying something weird or off the wall or just being very quiet and shy, which is not at all my personality. 

I’m just so overwhelmed and this weekend before starting has been really hard. I have no friends here yet, though everyone is friendly. I just don’t know how to be less anxious about starting a new job."
New Employee Onboarding before interview?,"Hi, so I applied to a position that seems to be a part of a personnel services thing(they have a bunch of positions for random things that are temp to hire) and I received a call for an interview with these people. After I said I was still looking they sent me onboarding stuff(background check, I-9, W-4, Bank Account) to fill out prior to the interview. Is this normal?
I've only ever had to do this stuff from the National Park Service and that was after the interview and after being hired, but before actually showing up.

Thanks!"
The First 90 Days,I am moving to a different state and accepting a position within the same field as I currently work in. I know the first 90 days is critical when starting a new position. Any advice or suggestions on how to be the most successful?
New employer has asked me to start earlier.. I can’t...,"Okay so, I’ve got a new job, have the contract signed and dated etc.. they also asked me when I would like to start my new role.. I have said the 2nd December... this is due to me being on holiday from 24-27th November.. they have emailed asking if it is possible for me to start sooner, the week before which I’d be on holiday for anyway (wouldn’t be back til the Thursday).. I’d like to say no but I’m not sure how to go about this as I don’t want to look bad before ive even started.. (probably over thinking this but will they rescind my job offer if I say no?)

If anyone has any tips on what to say, I’d really appreciate it!"
"Got Job Offer, HR Process Took a Long Time and Company is Giving Up","Hi everyone,

I got a job offer in another country months ago and the HR process and Visa support process had been rather unpleasant. The process hit a snag at the moment and I'm getting the feeling that the company is giving up on it. I will try to lay out the events as plainly as I can and hope you could offer some advice. Please bear with me:

07 Mar: Got the job offer through email

18 Mar: HR sent me a draft contract for reference

03 Apr: I travelled to the company to meet the people before making a final decision. Happy with it and decided to say yes.

03 Apr: I asked for the final version of the contract

18 Apr: HR sent me the final version of the contract (after multiple emails to ask for it; there was simply no response from them between 3 - 18 Apr)

18 Apr: I signed the contract and sent it to them, and asked for a copy of the contract signed by Company.

26 Apr: HR sent me a copy of contract signed by both parties

02 May: I asked HR some questions about visa application process

(no response whatsoever)

21 May: HR replied that their Lawyer consultant (hired from outside the company) will contact me and guide me through Visa Application

24 May: Lawyer contacted me and asked for documents for assessment

27 May: I sent required documents to Lawyer

(no response from Lawyer; I sent one or two emails to ask for updates)

12 Jun: Lawyer replied and scheduled a skype call for the next day

13 Jun: Skype call to discuss visa application

11 Jul: I visited the embassy to make visa application (this was the earliest embassy appointment I could secure after my call with Lawyer)

The HR and Lawyer had been largely slow in response and passive at best. To make matters worse, my visa application on the 11 Jul failed because we simply applied for the wrong visa category. Prior to the visa application, I have suspected that I may be applying for the wrong visa category (through the contents of an official document from the host country) and tried to reconfirm with the Lawyer. However, the Lawyer insisted that she was correct and I followed her recommendations in the end.

After the failed visa application attempt, the Lawyer expressed her opinion that the Embassy in my country was 'fussy and difficult to deal with' so I doubt she realized the error in application. I kept quiet and began working with her on our second attempt at it.

The preparation of my second visa application required the company to pay a fee for an official process in the host country. The Lawyer and I made that clear to the company and a few days ago, I received an email from HR '...we will contact you when we decide if and how we can support'. My heart sank.

This is where I am at right now. What I can surmise from all of this is that the decision makers (without knowing what's happening on the working level) in the Company are thinking that:

* The recruitment / visa application process is taking too long
* It is simply too damn difficult to get this person from X country to go through visa process

And with that, are probably deciding if it is worth the effort to pursue this further.

What do you think is my best course of action from here? Please take note that I'm still interested to join the company as the team I'll be working with are great.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm wondering what I can say to the decision makers to try to rectify the situation. My thought is to tell them of the events that transpired (similar to what I did above) and convey that I understand how it can be when resources are constrained but it nevertheless led to the delays in my case. And also to tell them what should have been an open-and-shut case at the Embassy was made complicated due to the mistake that was made. Of course I'll be as diplomatic as possible. What are your thoughts on this idea?"
Do large companies ever rescind offers randomly?,"I accepted a job offer a couple of weeks ago with a relatively large national company in the U.S. It came after months of grueling interviews and false promises. This has left me fairly suspicious of the entire process.

I signed my job offer and received confirmation, passed my background check and received confirmation, and began my onboarding paperwork. My start date isn't for another 2 months so I'm still nervous.

I've made it this far, but what can still go wrong? How often are job offers rescinded at this point?"
[Hired for first job] Am I messing up my communication?,"Hey /r/jobs, I just got recruited for my first opportunity (yay), and the process has been a bit too slow. They first called on November 14th for a first screening, then scheduled for a skype interview on december 5th, then gave me an offer on december 11th.  The offer however was just an email congratulating me for passing the last interview and asking me for the date I'd like to start (maximum was january 6th) so they could put it in the contract, I emailed on the same day of the congratulatory email stating I can make it for the 30th of December. One week later and no contract was sent, and the tickets were getting increasingly expensive due to holiday season.

Although it's been sort of in the back of my head that this could be a scam (it was all very easy, but they also needed someone with my background desperately), they all had @company name, had full linkedin profiles with profile picture and everything, the skype interview matched their linkedin faces, and the company has its own website, linkedin profile, linkedin submissions and articles, so I'm sure it's all legitimate. However I still got uneasy given how sudden I needed to move out to work and how easy the interview process was so I have emailed them earlier today, and they confirmed they'd need me there on January 6th, and supposedly they were meant to have attached the offer letter in the email for me to sign and didn't do that, so I sent them another email asking for it in case they had forgotten.

I'm sorry if it seems a bit confusing, but this process has been all over the place. Rushed and at the same time slow and I don't know if I should just be waiting for them or if it's OK to email them for these inquiries.

I have been taught that you should keep communications with employees and employers to a minimum and only do it if it advances the professional interests of both parties so I am sort of at lost here if I am handling it correctly or not.

Thank you for any advice you could give!"
Question about Background Check,"So my new employer has actually hired me (I signed the contracts and everything and today is my second day on the job). For reference, I’m at a consulting company and yet to go on site to a client.

However they have not yet completed the background check and I just filled out the employment and education verification consent forms today.

I’m wondering, do they check primarily to validate the information I presented on my resume, or do they scour for all traces of me? The post secondary I listed on my resume is correct and I do have a proper degree from there. And I have worked in a job relevant to my current one for 2 years after that (I don’t remember if I disclosed my full education for that check, or if they even asked for full education verification in that check)

However, I have a post secondary school that I didn’t finish from which is not listed in my resume (disciplinary expulsion back in 2013 when I was a dumb kid, but no criminal record from it) and I didn’t list it on the background check forms. Will that turn up on a search? If someone were to actually look at the years, there is a gap between my secondary and most recent post secondary, but I’m wondering if the check is conducted based on all public and voluntarily submitted information. 

And if I were to have disclosed it, would a check be able to uncover the reason behind my leaving? I would rather avoid all this if possible because everything on my resume can be verified properly, but if this will get out then I would like to get out ahead of it and amend my disclosure and explain later if necessary"
Would a 4 day work week with 10 hours each day be too tiring and draining?,"So for my new job I have a couple different scheduling options. It’s a 40 hour work week in total. I could do a regular 8 hour workday, 5 days a week or I could do 4 days a week, 10 hours each day. I could also do an alternate of the two, like 8 hours all 5 days one week and then 10 hours for 4 days the next week, and keep that pattern.

What do you think would be best? This will be my first full time job and I want to do well, so I don’t want to work a schedule where I’m exhausted by the middle of the week. I’m leaning towards the 10 hours for 4 days schedule because it cuts commute costs, but I don’t know if the loss of energy is worth it."
"What exactly is ""business casual""?","Hi folks, 
I've been working at a grocery chain for quite some time and finally received an offer at a veterinary clinic (dream job yay!). Until I've finished my training as a veterinary assistant, they don't want me wearing scrubs. Understandable, given that clients will probably ask me medical questions more frequently should I be wearing them. In the mean time, I was told to wear business casual clothes. 

As someone who comes from a background of wearing jeans and t-shirts to work, I'm not quite sure what this even means. 

I am female if that helps. 

Khakis? Slacks? Button up shirts? 

Thanks!"
Switching jobs -I have a trip booked for May. Asking for experiences with new employers for vacation before accrued time?,"Hi! Not sure if I flagged the right flair. 

Like the title says, I am switching jobs and one of my top places I am waiting to hear back from has accrued vacation time. I won't have enough accrued vacation time by May - I will be taking a trip and will be gone 12 days (vacation and sister's graduation). 

Does anyone have experience with telling new employers that they will be gone for more days than they're accrued vacation? I'm willing to not get paid for part of the time but hope that I won't have to change my vacation time (booked with BF while at my current job)."
How much notice should I give?,"I received a verbal job offer yesterday from a company I've aspired to work at for the last 10 years, given I pass a criminal background check. I received notice today from the third party company performing the check that I was squeaky clean. No surprise there. 

I started the job I am currently at around the end of July. The current company job culture is abhorrent, but I would like to give them some notice that I am moving on. 

Should I wait to give notice until I get an actual offer letter? If I do this I won't be able to give the current company any real notice. Should I tell them now and have good faith that the admired company will in fact hire me? I worry it will all be taken away from me, but I think I'm letting my anxiety get the best of me.

What do you all think?"
Unsure if I should stay at this job?,"I have been with my current company for around 19 months. For the first 18 months (also my first job after graduate school), I worked in a challenging environment that gradually became more toxic, as time passed, due to low pay, issues not being resolved from administrators, numerous staff quitting due to burnout and never-ending staff shortages, ethical concerns, etc. I requested to transfer to a different department 2 months ago into a slightly different role (for slightly higher pay) and more growth opportunities. I knew other people who had left my former department to transfer to my current department, and they had positive experiences when changing, and I hoped I would have the same.

I have been at my new job for 3 weeks, and given the 3 varied roles within my position, I have one ""main"" supervisor, but also 3 ""additional"" supervisors for each of my roles. I thought this would be a ""good"" thing to have different insight and mentorship; however, it has frequently resulted in miscommunication among the 4 supervisors when advising me for what to do for the varied roles within my positions, as well as figuring out who is responsible to ""train"" me for different roles. I am frequently told how to complete a task from one of these supervisors, but then having my ""main"" supervisor become frustrated with the differences in information being shared with me. I only see my ""main"" supervisor 1-2 time(s) a week, so on the days I do not see her, I have to e-mail her, and hope I am given a response that way. There are also times that my supervisors have not communicated necessary training information to me because they believe that another supervisor has already told me the necessary information and/or due to assuming I transferred within the company, I should already know the information (which is not possible due to differences in the departments). When I interviewed for this new position, the directors were aware of my limited experience related to some aspects of this new job, but felt confident that I could learn on the job and with experience, which I hoped also. The department has never hired someone into so many different positions like what they made my position to be, and say they are learning, as they go, with how to best supervise me, but it's feeling very frustrated.

I feel that all of these different supervisors are now realizing the impacts of the miscommunication during my training process, and have been asking me how ""training"" has been going, and are not very happy with the results. They are expecting me to independently complete my job responsibilities starting within the next 2 weeks. They have been having me shadow one of my supervisors 2-3 days a week to watch how they complete their specified job responsibilities, which has definitely been insightful to watch; however, with all of the time spent observing, they have given me very minimal on the job training related to my workload for one of these components, which is very different than my supervisor's.

Today, one of the supervisors spoke with me privately (and mentioned she would be speaking with my other supervisors to see how everything has been going, etc) to ask how training has been going, etc, to which she questioned me if I felt ""ready"" to independently complete some other aspects of my job due to my limited experience with some areas of the position, and also mentioned that if she had interviewed me, she would have highlighted other pertinent information related to the job to have a better depiction of the job, etc. I felt that she also implied that she does not feel I am the best fit for this position, as I said I was interested in taking this position to gain more experience in different areas, but told me that was not the purpose of this position, and that I needed to view myself as more of an ""expert"" to succeed in the position. However, with only 3 weeks at this new job, and most of my time spent in ""training"" by watching other people do their job, and not being given direct support with my own workload, I am definitely feeling overwhelmed and not confident in my abilities, and feel like the department now regrets hiring me, although I know I did not misrepresent my credentials, etc. It seems like this new department is almost just like my previous department, disappointingly, with a toxic and unsupportive environment again. Another supervisor also mentioned to me that she was not used to having new hires to the department with such limited experience either, which again is making me question why I was hired.

Additionally, I am scheduled to work at 2 different locations, but do not have adequate resources to complete my job, as at one of my locations, I temporarily have no office, desk, or computer to use due to building renovations for a few weeks, and at my other location, I have no desk to store any pertinent files, and have to borrow one of my supervisor's filing cabinet to file important documents.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do with this situation? I was really looking forward to new experiences at this job, but between the inconsistent training/supervisor, lack of appropriate resources at my job, continuing miscommunications, etc, I am feeling really inadequate and disappointed with this new position, and am unsure if things will work out, if I should just quit already, etc? I have briefly started looking for another new job, but my location is super saturated for my job, and it is very challenging to find quality jobs where I live..."
"Accepted a job offer from HR dept, should I email my manager before I start my job?","Maybe I'm overthinking this:
I attended interview 2-3 weeks ago and received both a verbal and written offer from HR agent, which I've accepted a week ago. I'm scheduled to start Oct 21. I also started the onboarding process (paperwork, company portal, etc). Should I trust that HR has notified my manager or should I contact/email him directly? I'm just paranoid that I haven't spoken to my manager since the interview, which was about 3 weeks ago. I'm planning on sending an email next week but don't know what to write. Help?"
Do most places where you live drug test?,I just see so many posts that reference a drug test for any kind of job. No one drug tests where I live unless its operating machinery or driving. Is it really that strict?
How to set the right tone as leader,"Tomorrow I’m starting a new role as a supervisor. My team consist of four people. I’ve been a supervisor before but this is at a much bigger place and more layers into management. 

How do I set the tone for my first day? I want everyone to know I don’t want any drama or bulls*it around the office but I am willing to be there for them & I am a nice person."
"Job offer on table, radio silence from company","So about 3 weeks ago I had a very successful interview. A few days later, I received an email from the hiring manager that said she was excited to offer me the job, pending background check. 

I sent back the forms right away, and was informed that the process usually takes around two weeks. A couple days later, hiring manager sends me another email saying she forgot to request my references (I had offered to provide them at several points during the interview process/in my thank you email following the interview) so I sent them along and asked her to keep me updated. 

It turns out there was a typo in the email address of one of my references (so embarrassing, I know, I had sent this same document to several other places too ugh), so we had another back and forth for me to provide the correct information and she says the HR team is finishing up the reference checks and she will keep me posted. 

This past Thursday marked the two week point since submitting my background check, and I haven't heard anything from them. I sent an email on Friday to check in and see how things are going, and have not received a response. 

This is weird because prior to this point, the hiring manager has been incredibly responsive, always getting back to me on the same day or early the next. It's also a 24/7 facility and I know the manager's work week is Tues-Sat, so it's not like the weekend would have an impact on her ability to communicate with me. She also emphasized to me a lot during the interview process that even when she is not at work, she is ALWAYS reachable by email. 

Should I be worried? Is HR just taking their sweet time? This is a dream job for me so the sudden lack of communication has me extremely worried and anxious. Just hoping someone in this subreddit has experience or words of wisdom for such a situation."
"Might fail a drugtest for a new job, need advice. (Post interview, pre acceptance)","[MARIJUANA].  I’m going to be offered a job that I am overqualified for, after nailing 2 interviews back to back. I received an email today from the recruiter saying they would love to offer me the position. (The drug test is after my acceptance of the position) I live in MA, it is recreationally legal as well as medically legal. I have been a heavy smoker now for years and it is deep in my body. At the interview process I was made aware that the company does drugtest and since then I have stopped smoking, (this was about 2 weeks ago). I am nearly certain that I am going to show positive for THC on this drug test. The recruiter did tell
Me that the company DOES ACCEPT medical marijuana cards. I DO NOT have one yet but I am 100% able and willing to go apply and receive my medical card. Should I tell the recruiter about my dilemma (that I was a smoker before hand but stopped but it will still show in my system) before the test. or should I wait until after the test to say anything and and either hope it’s okay or hope I pass. 

I will have the offer conversation with the recruiter tomorrow

Thankyou"
What is your opinion of “sink or swim” onboarding?,"Hello!

I am a new grad, I graduated college back in December and I am currently getting a masters degree. 

I previously worked for a company that hired me when I was three months out of college. I was told after a few weeks that the company culture was “sink or swim”. I ended up being fired within the first 90 days.

Lately, I have been actively avoiding companies that are sink or swim and have been actively asking questions about company onboarding procedure during the interview process.

Many people think sink or swim is a valid onboarding strategy, but I don’t understand it. It personally seems like a bad idea, especially for new grads and interns. How do you guys feel about the sink or swim approach to onboarding?"
"Job has a start date as the 1st of the month, but new employee orientation is the 7th of the month?","Because my job offer letter says start date is 1st of month, originally I assumed that I was supposed to report for work on the 1st. It sounds like they don't go over benefits or anything until the new employee orientation on the 7th. Not sure whether to go to work on the 1st or 7th? This is a major university. My thoughts are to ask HR, but thought I would get some input here first thanks!"
salary negotiation if it is slightly above industry standard?,"I’m a recent college grad and got my first offer letter! I’m super excited to work and leave unemployment behind me but of course everyone is telling me to negotiate which is stressing me out hella aha. I’m just curious on some of your thoughts! 

This job listing had the salary range provided and i was offered the highest of the range. The amount is about $1000+ the industry median for my area.
I don’t plan on asking for anything too drastic, like a $1.5k (~11%) increase, this is an hourly rate position. I know many companies expect you to negotiate, but is it the right decision to with given these circumstances? Sorry it’s so vague, the inner paranoid in me is worried my employer might figure out it’s me or something hahah

Many many thanks :)

Edit/update: my friend told me to check out Glassdoor’s know your worth calculator. 
in my areas market value, I am on the lower end of the salary according to Glassdoor. 7k less than the median. So this is a different comparison from the one listed above."
"Company is paying for training/accommodation in another state, what are hotel stays like? Do you usually get a single room or stay with another person?",I'm pretty new to the working work and have no clue how this would work.

Probation period extended. Advice needed.,"Hi All,

I am graduate chemical engineer whose just started working in the last three months. The company I work for has started a new office in my country (1 year old) and within the company and I am there first graduate engineer. I have only met my in line manager once in the last three months for face to face work or discussion ( the guy who is responsible for me - he is very busy I joined at a time when the current project we are working for is ending). During the job I was working mainly in autocad which they give training for. The problem lies in the fact that I was never able to showcase my technical skill (chemical engineering knowledge) an this appears to be the main reason why they are extending my probabtion period. Should I be worried? Any advice? Tips?"
i'm miserable at my dream job,"i’ve worked steadily in my field for 4 years, plus a lot of volunteering both before and during that time. i’m only in my early 20’s so while i understand that i certainly have a lot to learn, i’m not coming into this job from a place of absolutely no experience.

previously, my position dealt more with customers than anything else, although a lot of the more data oriented tasks i perform now are ones that i also performed off and on as needed in my previous workplace when i was promoted to manager. i'm good with computers and i'm a fast learner, so i thought the transition to this new position would be smooth. i moved states and jobs for this position at a large company, well-known and admired in my field of work. my previous company was on a smaller scale in a lesser known area, so i was surprised to get this interview at all, let alone the job. 

however, one month into starting my work here, i’m miserable. i dread going to work every day. i try to start each morning with a positive attitude, but something always goes wrong before lunch. i’ve had my share of good days and projects where i've done very well, but any small mistake i make during the week seems to overshadow them.

coming into this position, i had to acclimate not only to a new way of doing things i mostly knew how to do, but to the fact that my position in this large company is more on the data analysis end than the customer service side of the position i excelled in before. they use abbreviations i’ve never heard of, hundreds of custom reports i didn’t even have need for until now. i liked to think i was doing a fairly good job getting used to things, but as the days go by i’m not sure. it has not been easy, but i’ve taken the initiative to take detailed notes, look them over in my spare time, ask questions. 

nobody is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, and these things would be alright if it weren’t for the way i get treated when i make a small mistake. one of my supervisors has a consistently nasty attitude with me when i ask a question or need clarification, and my coworkers aren’t always available to assist me (ETA: there are only five of us in my department total, so who i can go to is limited). my supervisor is easily irritated with me despite the fact that i’ve had no negative interactions with them. 

there have been several instances where another coworker showed me how to perform a task and left out some more minor information that i did not know i needed until my manager brought it to my attention (ie- i didn’t get the updated contact list for a project, i wasn’t told which report to pull/i was told to use an outdated report, etc). 

i get new tasks and information thrown at me on a daily basis; i take extensive notes and ask questions when i have them, but i don’t understand how i can take notes on information i’m not given in the first place. i’m still fairly new and it’s only been a month, so until i’m more familiar with the reports and the way they like things done, i can really only do things the way that i’ve been told to do them. 

we have a ""best practices"" manual but it's outdated. i'm told to look there if i have questions, but either the thing i'm looking for isn't there, or the procedure is obsolete and i get reprimanded for using the old instructions.

i could understand if it was a large, more crucial mistake that affected the outcome of a project or impacted company-wide data, but it’s not. the numbers are correct. the format is correct. the work is carefully done. in almost every instance thus far, it’s been that i have sent an email to the wrong group of people or had too many people on the receiving end of an email due to the aforementioned contact list/lack thereof, or even once where i sent an email from my own email address rather than the email address for generic reports. this is not sensitive information. the entire company can access the reports i send out at any given time as they’re stored on a shared drive, so it’s not like i’m leaking secrets to the wrong department or anything like that. 

the worst thing i have done thus far was that a formula did not get updated in a spreadsheet, and i didn't catch it. we have other coworkers look over reports before we send them out for this exact reason. the coworker who looked it over said it was great and that everything was set to send it out. however, when someone from another department saw that the number in question had not updated correctly, i was solely the one at fault in my supervisor's eyes. i did make the initial mistake by overlooking it, and i apologized and made a note to be sure i check that every time from here on out, but i don't feel that i'm the only one who should be singled out when that's the exact reason we all check each other's work.

to top it all off, i’ve tried making friends but nothing has stuck. i’ve been on a few lunches with people i’ve chatted to and taken the steps to invite my coworkers out to lunch with me as well, but nothing comes of it other than acknowledging each other in the hallway or saying a polite “good morning”. nobody i’ve been to lunch with has responded to my invitations to go to lunch again. i’ve never had problems talking to people or even making solid friendly acquaintanceships, and i had a lot of friends at my previous jobs, but i feel like i have no support system here, or even anyone who likes me enough to talk to me more than once or twice. 

i am beyond frustrated. i feel exhausted and worn-down. i feel isolated, stupid, embarrassed constantly. i take the criticism with a smile and an “i’ll make note of that, thank you!”. i do make note of it, and while i haven’t repeated a mistake, i keep making minor mistakes of the same type. i don’t mind criticism, but when it seems like i’m getting picked at for every little thing i do wrong, it starts to dishearten me. i picked up my last position so quickly, and i had high hopes that experience would be of more help to me here than it has been. 

i don’t know what to do. i cant quit. i don’t WANT to quit. i just want to be better. if anything, i want to stay as long as possible and prove that i can do it. i'm afraid they'll get fed up and fire me, but i have no way of knowing how they feel about my performance. my actual boss hasn't said anything negative to me, but he isn't the one i'm concerned about.

sorry if this is all over the place, i just need to get it out. does anyone have advice? have you been in a similar situation? i need some guidance. i don't want to quit, i just want to know how to cope until i get more into the swing of things here"
Losing Deloitte job offer due to missing start date,"Hello All,

&#x200B;

I've accepted a graduate job offer at Deloitte UK that starts early September. However, due to UK visa complications I will almost certainly miss the first 2-4 weeks which forms part of their 6 weeks induction/training.

&#x200B;

My question is, how likely is Deloitte to withdraw the job offer because of my missing the initial training/ starting late?

&#x200B;

Also, I will receive my full contract next week, should I sign it straight away to make it less appealing for them to rescind or hold off signing it until they confirm they're happy for me to start late and change the start date on the contract?

&#x200B;

I have already informed both their student recruitment and the immigration team about my situation in writing  and over the phone since March, several times in fact, but didn't get any answer besides that they're informed the ""relevant advisor"" and will get back to me soon. 

&#x200B;

Any opinions or tips would be very highly appreciated."
Nervous for my new role,"I’ve just graduated from university and landed a good permanent job. My first day is tomorrow and I’m really nervous about it, I’m always worried that I may not be up to the task or my prospective colleagues would dislike me. I don’t feel so confident though I feel like it’s just going to pass. Any advice on how I can make a good first impression and learn quickly?"
Do people start new jobs typically at the beginning of the next month in the US?,"At the interview at a fintech company I was asked when I could start working for them. Since, I don't have a job at the moment, my answer was ""immediately"". They moved forward with me, and the HR lady asked me about my earliest start date. Since I want to finish some coursework I'm doing right now, I answered that i could start Monday in two weeks, which is 28th of October. 

I'm not a US citizen (I'm coming from Europe, this will be my first job in the US) and the notification period for leaving a job can be 1 to 3 months, so switching jobs typically does not take place under a month. 

Assuming that the company would have to do some paperwork and some internal setups, I assumed that two weeks would be a reasonable time frame. But now I'm concerned that my answer ""immediately"" and my gap of two weeks could be misinterpreted by the company. The whole interview process with them was quite quickly, so I guess they are a fast-moving company.

I know that the notification period for leaving a job in the US is typically two weeks and I'm wondering if that results in a ""switching time"" of two weeks. 

What do you typically answer to the question about the earliest start date given that you don't have any blocking responsibilities at the moment?"
"New job, feel like I’m scarred from my last job and not sure how to act in a corporate office.","My last job and first job out of college was a very toxic and micro managed environment. Which I had no idea since I was naive to the workforce and didn’t realise until about a year in. I spent 1.5 years there before I left. 

Now I’m in this new job, but feel like I have a really unhealthy mindset about how corporate jobs are. My last job we were basically glued to our office and had to make mgmt aware if we needed to leave for work related reasons. My old job required a lot of offsite meetings, lunches, getting out to stores, etc that it was very common to be in and out of the office for the day. Yet, every time we needed to leave even if just 15 minutes we needed to let our manager know. We couldn’t just put it on our calendar, which our managers had full access to and could see, we had to get verbal/written confirmation that we were leaving. We also had to let our manager know whenever we were changing our hours and had to stick to that schedule until we said we were changing again. It couldn’t be a work 7-4 one day and 8-5 the next. Often leadership would walk around the halls and check in and see who wasn’t in their office. If you weren’t there, they would ask your manager were you were. Working through lunch and staying late were also common and expected. 

I’m in this new role at a new large company with about 400 employees, my last one had 47. I can’t help but fear people are watching my every move. I feel like I need to get permission from my manager to have a flex day and often staying over my 8 hours to make sure they know I’m doing my hours. I’m scared to be on my phone and scared to leave my cubicle (my manager sits diagonal from me) because im worried they are wondering what I’m doing and if I’m gone for an extended time (like ten minutes) that I need to add those to my total hours worked and stay later. It doesn’t seem like that’s the culture here, but it’s only been 3 weeks and I’m still doing it to be safe. No one has asked me to do any of this at my new job, I simply feel like I need to since that’s how my last job was. I really don’t know how to act in my new role. 

Is what I experienced previously pretty standard for professional jobs or was I in a bad environment? I really can’t tell if I experienced something out of the norm. How are things normally in a “corporate office?”"
Finally starting a new job tomorrow after being in a toxic workplace for over a year!,"I'm super nervous and getting anxious, does anyone have any helpful first day tips?

Need advice for what is ladies business professional. This is dress code for orientation. The job is business casual.,"Hey there.

So I recently accepted a new job at a major hospital. Very excited. The job itself is business casual and you can also wear scrubs (Seems like it's something they're testing new). My interview I even dressed business casual. (grey top with a black cardigan, black slacks, black flats)

So I just re-read my orientation instructions for TOMORROW and it's says the dress is business professional. So I'm kind of freaking out.

Both my mom and my boyfriend are saying it shouldn't be a big deal to wear a solid colored blouse with slacks and shoes. And the term ""business professional"" for women is different then what it says on the internet. But when I look up on the internet, it says basically a suit for a woman or a dress, which neither I own. I have black slacks and the shoes. I just need a suitable suit jacket and  white top.

So it also says that scrubs are acceptable but I want to make a good impression and feel I shouldn't go this route because:

1. My job is in a office setting so I really wouldn't need scrubs and so it would feel weird to wear this as a first impression for orientation.
2. I'm afraid, what if I'm the only one wearing scrubs? And everyone around me looks all fancy.

Should I follow my gut and buy a suit jacket or could I go without the jacket and just wear slacks, white blouse, and shoes?"
"Just got a job as an office assistant, I have no idea what the fuck I’m doing. Any advice for my first day tomorrow?","So I applied to be a receptionist, but the manager interviewed me for ALL positions basically. He asked questions and threw some scenarios at me for sales, front desk, and office assistant.    
I guess he didn’t want me as a receptionist and decided he would offer a position as an office assistant at another location. Which I’m cool with! I’ve actually always wanted a job like that and it pays a little more. The commute is 15 minutes longer but whatever, I’ve been desperate to break out of minimum wage with no degree and a disability that prevents me from doing physical labor.    
         
The manager is really cool. He told me I’ll need to start dressing business professional and when I said I couldn’t afford to he said I have 1 month to get a basic wardrobe going. Until then I can wear my regular clothes. He also told me the training is a month long process and very thorough.   
But I’m still VERY nervous! I’ve never had a job like this before at ALL. I’ve only done retail/food. And now suddenly I’m going to work in an office. What the ????       
I feel like I don’t deserve the position. I’m 22 so definitely not the youngest person to do this kind of job but I feel like I’m not even adulty enough...if that makes sense. I tried on some business clothes and I looked like a little kid playing dress up. I’m not educated. I’m not smart. I’m not that organized. I’m just a dummy who got lucky and I feel like everyone’s gonna find out I’m a fraud, even though I didn’t lie about anything and he knows my work history / experience is a joke.     
    
Anyways....I really want to do well. Maybe even impress them! But I at least don’t want to disappoint them."
"Etiquette? Signed job offer, start date established. Do you check in with HR a few days before start date?","Wondering what the etiquette is here as I’m trying to make the best first impression.

Since most jobs expect 2 weeks notice when you resign, it seems like many people would have 3 weeks before starting at their new company. 

If it has been 3 weeks since you last had contact with HR discussing the job offer, benefits, start date etc is it considered normal to email HR a few days before your start date to basically say “hey it’s been a few weeks since we spoke. Just wanted to let you know I’m still coming and that all the paperwork I sent in is good to go”?

Some part of me is thinking this isn’t really needed. If HR vetted me they’ll know I’m a responsible adult (otherwise they wouldn’t have hired me) and checking in is kind of...redundant?"
Nothing explained on the first day?,"I started a job today, at a dog boarding/grooming facility. I am in the US. 

Keep in mind, I was under the impression I would fill out all necessary paperwork (W-4, how I’d be paid) this morning. 

Got there at 8, put me right to work. Took the dogs out to go potty all morning. Got told, “Start taking them out.” No knowledge of any of the dogs’  temperaments, no info about them. Just start working. 

Would have been nice to know liability info in case one of the dogs bites. A couple of them were aggressive towards me, and it took 5-10 minutes to track someone down for help. 

The manager there expected me to already know their policies and how to do things and was getting upset I didn’t know what I was doing. The other girl there said she’s super hard on new people and just want people to do their job. I just started; I at least want a chance! 

She said on weekends it’s super busy so I don’t get the”luxury” of a lunch break, so I need to bring food or call some in. (Eat while working, I guess?) I don’t get breaks either. I’ll be working 10-11 hours on the weekend. I can work, but not that long without a break. 

I went home, quickly ate, went back, and asked the girl at the front when I’ll fill out my paperwork. She didn’t know.....she said she didn’t have hers filled out for months. 

So then the manager comes back out and says it could be weeks before my stuff is filled out, and that’s just the way they do things there. 

I said any job I’ve had, I had to have that info filled out before I could even start. She said there it’s different, and they’re all friendly with each other and I shouldn’t worry whether I’d get paid, that it would happen.

I left because I was so uncomfortable with everything. This place is not a chain. 

Is anything normal about this? I will not be going back."
Making transitions smoother: how to switch firms?,"I'm a lawyer in my late 20s.  I have worked for the same firm since I graduated university - so about 4 years now.  After a good run of interviews,  I was offered a job at a competing firm.  And I start there in early December.

Are there any important things to look out for when joining a new team?  Do's and Dont's?  Anything I can do in the coming month to prepare for the shift?"
"New project feels off, how to address this?","Im a software consultant, which basically means that I work at client's office for a certain period, then change to a new client. I started with my second client ever about a month ago, and it's been rather painful.

The people here are generally nice, but I haven't really gotten any onboarding here. The first three weeks I had nothing to do, despite telling the project leads every day. I have been receiving a vibe that nobody really makes decisions here, no one really knows why I was hired here or what I should be doing.

Whenever I have scraped up something to do, I've either immediately been approached by the project lead letting me know that the task isn't ready for implementation. Other times, the tasks are really obscure and I basically have to go digging the information piece by piece from people all around the place.

The actual coding seems to be really opinionated, but at the same time lacks processes and common quality control. Nothing is documented, and I always have to work on my best guesses. Asking the other developers usually leads to tangential chats and despite multiple effort, I never get any real answers.

This is... Weird. All the other people here seem they're really happy about this place and the project, but I don't. Socially, I've been accepted to the group and people ask how I'm doing, but that's it. No one's on charge, no one is pedantic, nobody documents things, there's no processes. It's a huge hurdle to work on anything here if you haven't already worked here for years.

I've been thinking of discussing this with my own company's people, but I don't want to be a nagger who just wants to have the perfect project. It's just that I want to work here, but it has been made really difficult."
I put my uncles' company on my resumé and my new job wants a W2 or paystub from it.,"So over the years I've occasionally done some work for my uncles' company (maybe 3-4 hours a month average) and they pay me cash when I go see them or take me out to dinner or buy me that thing I've been wanting, etc. So I put it on my resumé as something like ""May 2011-Present"". Now, my new company that I'm supposed to start at on Monday wants to know why I forgot to put it on my background check form and wants either a W2 or paystubs.

&#x200B;

What do I do? Can I just say ""Hey, it's my uncles' company and don't do a lot for them and they just pay me cash""? Is that a bad idea? My uncle said he'd be willing to make me a paystub, but that seems kinda illegal. I'm in US-NY (as is the new company) and they're in US-FL if that's important."
Randomly selected to NOT drug test??,"Hi there,

I recently accepted an offer for a Senior-level tech role at JPMorgan Chase (think development/design/engineer). 

As I’m completing the online scheduling for different onboarding steps, I notice they state on the portal that I’ve been randomly selected to NOT drug test. 

...

I’ve never seen that before, as every non-contract role I’ve had has required a drug test. 

I consume cannabis fairly regularly, for several years (I’m a disabled vet and use it to treat PTSD symptoms and pain), but I obviously stopped consuming for a while in anticipation of this offer. 

Does anybody have any knowledge of JPMorgan testing after onboarding, or even of this practice? 

Thanks in advance!"
Ghosted during onboarding?,"The first day of classes is a bit over a week away, and I accepted an offer from Kelly Educational Staffing to be a substitute teacher.  At this point I have completed all of the online parts including the online training, but I haven't been given any information about how I am supposed to schedule myself, and the person in charge of onboarding me hasn't replied to any emails sent asking what sort of timeline there is for the new hire orientation & attempts to call go straight to voice mail.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do next, and I have heard that they will call you as early 5AM if they need somebody last-minute but only by lurking on their Glassdoor.  I have no idea how I might go about scheduling myself.  I have no idea when I should expect to be paid.  I *only* know how much I can expect to be paid from searching online.  The new hire training is presumably supposed to cover this, but I have heard literally nothing from them and I know from one of my references that they've never been contacted either.

&#x200B;

(At this point: Ha, no, they've already ensured that I am going to keep looking for a different job and they're also now ensuring that the notice I will give them is likely to be a short email or voice mail message informing them that ""As of \[this date\], I quit.""  With possibly the chorus from Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye added if I'm leaving a voice mail.  They never would be on my resume, so leaving on bad terms isn't going to hurt me.)

&#x200B;

So, what should I do now?  Especially since some of the things required from me cost $ and they have had me do training unique to them but seem to consider me an independent contractor?"
Tips on negotiation salary and benefits,"So next week I have a very promising meeting with a potential employer. I am very aware that no contracts have been signed yet, however after a very positive phone-call with the manager of the department, I am quite positive that the company really wants to hire me. This puts me - for the first time ever - in a position where I have some room to negotiate terms. What are some tips you guys have? It's a webdevelopment job. I am currently unemployed, so I do need a job soon, but I also do not want to over-bid in fear of them saying ""Oh.. well that's way too much, we can't accept that, never mind then"". Am I overthinking this? Any general tips on negotiation salary and benefits would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
Remote Job Startup,"Question 1: Been a PC/windows user all through professional career and am now being asked if I want a Mac or pc for my new job.  Was told they don’t have a PC on hand so would have to go buy one and asked I tell them which one to get. 

I’ll be using excel 90% of my day and have always used it via a PC and windows.

Thoughts on which laptop to get vs a MacBook Pro from them?

2. So just got hired to work 100% remote. This is my first remote job - they’ll provide a laptop and said they’d pay for the internet connection.

Should they be providing me anything else or reimbursing me for things like monitors and he providing a cell phone with internet or reimburse?"
Company made me an offer but the background check company has terrible reviews,"The background check company that my potential employer uses has 70 1-star reviews on Yelp.

&#x200B;

Reviewers say that they make harassing calls, steal identity, make people lose income for weeks by delaying background checks. Reviewers advise to not give any personal information to them.

&#x200B;

They have 70 1-star reviews since 2014, and no other reviews, this pretty much means that this is deserved, and the are really bad. Otherwise, how to explain that 70 different people all said bad things?

&#x200B;

What do I do? Do I still give my personal info to this company? I will have a job, but my identity would be stolen and some people I know would get harassed."
A week has passed since my drug screen. Do you think they would’ve contacted me if I failed by now?,"I accepted a job offer and had my drug screen (urine test) last week on Wednesday. The last time I smoked was September 15 and I just took one hit of a vape. Before that, I haven’t smoked in 5 months or so. Everyone’s telling me I should be fine, but I’m still a little paranoid. Thanks in advance!"
Got a job at a grocery store. Haven't been called and given training schedule/other info.,"So, on 7/22(a Monday) I went to an interview at a local grocery store. I wasn't even really interviewed, and was basically asked if I had open availability and did I want the job. Said yes, obviously. 

Was told that the next day I would receive an e-mail with a link to fill out tax info and other paperwork, then after I filled it out it would take a few days on their end to finalize whatever they had to do and I would receive a call with my training schedule and all that. 

I filled out the on-boarding paperwork about 10 minutes after receiving the e-mail the day after I was interviewed. Then I waited for a phone call. 

I called the next Monday and talked to someone and told them I had filled out the paperwork. Was again told that it would take a few days. OK, whatever. 

Two weeks from when I was interviewed go by. I call and ask if there was something I needed to do and was told that I was in the final step and I'd receive a call on Wednesday. 

It is now the following Wednesday, over 3 weeks from when I was first interviewed. 

What do I do? 

At this point I feel like I should just give up and start looking for something else. This wasn't a must-have job for me, since I'm going to be moving in the middle of October. I just wanted a job so I wouldn't have to dig too far into my savings to cover my recurring bills. 

I'm kind of pissed at myself because the day after I got this job, I received a call from Panera Bread and told them I had already found something. I used to work with a guy who works there and I asked him to give my name to his manager. I should have gone to that interview."
"Finally found a job, starting Monday.. but just realized I don't have two forms of ID. Will this bar me from starting?","Title. I spoke with my manager-to-be on Wednesday and he told me I needed to bring two forms of ID when I start on Monday, presumably for HR stuff. I went to get my social security card from my safe and realized my social security card and birth certificate were destroyed a few months ago.. don't really want to get into how, but yeah. 

I've looked into getting them replaced and won't be able to until mid-late next week at the earliest. So I'll only have my driver's license as a form of ID on Monday, and now I'm pretty much freaking out. I don't have a passport..

Will this likely disallow me from starting on Monday? What are my options here? I thought about calling my manager but the office is closed for Good Friday."
Currently being screened for 911 Operator. Need advice!,"Back story: I'm 28 years old. Studied Corrections/Law in Post-Secondary school. Graduated 4 years ago. Currently working full-time as a security guard, making just over Min. Wage. Current loans: $50,000 debt ($25k student loans, $25k vehicle loan). Can barely make ends meet.

I've been applying to jobs in my ""field"" since being out of school, 4 years ago. I've been to about 8 interviews within that time and have only been able to lockdown low-paying jobs. I worked as a Youth Care Worker 2 years ago right after school, but the stress was not worth the minimal pay (~$2/hr over min. wage). Unsure where my interviews have been going wrong. I've had a couple opportunities, and have somehow screwed them up. I believe my time is worth more than win. wage, and I'm a fairly competent worker. I have decided to stay at current security job for the experience, and believe it's good to stay at 1 job longer and wait for the right position. 

I applied to a large city in Canada for their open position of 911 Operator. Apparently they are hiring 20-40 people and pays $33/hr. This would be a lifechanger for me, and has now become a dream to lock this down. They responded back to my application through email with an online questionnaire about basic information regarding the job to ensure I was interested. I passed onto the next level and have set up a time to go to their HQ for a 2-hour testing segment, which includes: ""short term memory, typing, spelling, sentence clarity and reading comprehension. Evaluates call taking skills, such as computer-related multi-tasking abilities, keyboarding/data entry skills, memory retention, prioritization, map reading, call summarization and performance under stress."" This test is 14 days from today. 

My main concern is my typing skills. I tend to have terrible habits on a keyboard and poke at keys with my index fingers, and regularly look down at the keyboard. Regardless, I can do over 50wpm (this job requires 40wpm). I've been using a computer since I was like 12, so I'm very fast, but it's still a terrible habit. Should I be trying to break this habit and become a ""proper"" typer? Is that possible within 2 weeks AND maintain/improve the wpm requirements? Or should I just go in as is and hope they don't care how I type, as long as I can do it fast enough?

If anyone can give any other advice it would be greatly appreciated."
Recently started a job in a newly-created role. I've been getting minimal guidance or training and I'm not sure what to do.,"Context: as in the title, I've recently started a new job in a role that was newly created within an established, ~100 person software company. Basically, the plan was to hire someone full time to do a particular job that one team (team A) had a rotation for, and wanted to stop doing since it's out of the scope of their own roles. The people in team A work mostly remotely, and it's them who are my ""customers"" (and who I work with the most so far). However, I'm organizationally a member of a different team (team B) whose manager I report to. It's a weird structure and I got a sense of the weirdness during the interview process when the hiring manager (the manager of team A) revealed I would be reporting to someone else.

While it makes sense for me to be a part of team B given the set of tools and technologies I'm working with, since joining I've had almost no official training with either of the teams. My current training has consisted of shadowing members of team A as they do the job I've been hired to do, though this is proving difficult as they are all remote and keep doing parts of the job without me. I've also had very little official contact with either of the managers. At other companies I've worked for, I'm used to having weekly one-on-one check-ins with my managers (and sometimes daily check ins during onboarding), and after four weeks on the job, I haven't had a single one. Manager of team B (my manager) has assigned me some projects, which is fine, but they're all relatively advanced and have little to do with the job I was actually hired for (I also haven't been getting much help on them). As time goes on I do want to spend more time on these kinds of projects, but for now I first want to establish myself in the job I was hired to do. 

Truth be told, I'm starting to get worried. I'm still not sure how I should be spending my time, how long training should take, and how to get the training I need. I'm also relatively isolated since my primary customers are remote. It's clear to me now that little thought was given to this role's day to day, and there was (and is) little coordination between the leaders of the two teams regarding this role. I'm imagining it was basically team A saying ""there's this job we don't like and we want someone else on team B to do it for us"", and team B saying ""sure, we'd be glad to have another person"". I'm also totally unclear on how I'm going to be evaluated. Will I be reviewed by team A or B? What should my goals be? When should I expect to be ramped? How should I learn what I need to know? Who do I need to please?

I've been trying my best to manage in this unorganized situation, but as of right now it does not seem sustainable and I need clarity from my manager. Unfortunately he's definitely hands off, and while not a bad guy, mentoring does not appear to be a strongpoint of his. What do you recommend I do in this situation to get the guidance and clarity that I need?"
"Accepted a job offer, but no start date yet.","I accepted a job offer, signed an offer letter, but said the start date is contingent upon passing drug screening and background check. I last called the recruiter to ask the status of my background check and was supposedly cleared July 3rd. The company has been radio silent since then, should I keep trying to bug HR? I'm super anxious if the job even exists still.

Edit: Sorry forgot to include, I was verbally told my starting date would be July 8th, but I called on the 5th to see if I could see if I can officially start and the recruiter said not officially yet. So I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to do now."
Surviving the first week in big tech as an introvert,"Oh jeez, this is going to be a long, long, long week.

I just got done with my 2nd day at my new tech job. It's a wonderful place to work. Very modern with wonderfully ridiculous benefits (dogs allowed, indoor bike repair, fully stocked fridge, beer on tap in the break room, all that weird 21st century stuff). I like it a lot and I can't wait to dig into my new job.

But the noobie stuff. Oh man. The planned socials, new hire group activities, one on ones with department heads, dozens of people with names I've already forgotten eagerly asking me the same questions all day long, a million suggested clubs and random things I feel expected to do (poker Wednesday, karaoke Thursday, beer Friday, on and on and on). I forgot about all of the stuff they throw at you the first week. And it's magnified by 10000 in an ultra millennial tech company environment. 

Don't get me wrong, it's awesome to work at a place that values employee leisure and wants to make the environment comfortable and friendly. But as an introvert, I've come home and literally just passed out on the couch both days. I'm so exhausted, mentally and physically. I feel so incredibly drained of all of my energy I barely even want to eat dinner, talk to my husband, or pet my dogs. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? Any advice on how introverts can make it through the noob period without feeling completely, utterly overwhelmed by people but also not being standoffish?"
Got an offer and now crickets....,"Hey all. I recently received a job offer and accepted. They required a background and drug test before officially hiring. Well it’s been almost two weeks since I’ve started the background check and drug test processes and I haven’t heard anything back from the company and my first day is supposed to be on Monday, October 14th. Does this process normally take longer than a week? I already gave my two weeks notice at my current job and I’m getting nervous that I made the wrong move and now I’m going to end up jobless, which was not my plan at all. Please help calm my nerves, I’m freaking out over here!"
"After accepting the job offer, the company seems to ignore me. Should I be worried?","I accepted the job offer after negotiation, and just completed the background check process with the company. However, the recruiter and hiring manager recently seemed to ignore/unenthusiastic to my emails and phone calls (when I followed up, asked questions), compared to the time they extended me the offer (they responded very quick).

&#x200B;

After I accepted the offer, I sent to the hiring manager and other interviewers thank-you emails to express my appreciation but they didn't reply.

&#x200B;

I understand that they were busy but I'm also worried about the situation that they might lose interest in hiring me because of some unknown reasons and might be considering other candidates. I don't feel that they are as excited about hiring me as before. Since it's at-will employment, they can rescind the offer anytime they want.

&#x200B;

What should I do in this situation? Should I be worried? How could I confirm their interest in hiring me? Based on the offer, I would be starting to work with them in a week."
"Has anyone here ever landed a desirable job by accident or just by being in the right place at the right time? If so, what happened, and how did it turn out?","The 1990s American sitcom *Seinfeld* once featured an episode (S08E03, ""The Bizarro Jerry"") in which one of the main characters, Kramer, becomes employed at a firm called Brandt/Leland through a series of bizarre coincidences. If I recall correctly, he helps an employee with a copy machine while waiting for George outside the restroom, which leads to him being ushered into an urgent meeting by some unwitting office staff.  For the remainder of the episode, he works for Brandt/Leland for free before being ""fired"" by the supervisor for not delivering quality work.

To be sure, this story seems downright fantastical in 2019 (the episode aired in October 1996), but has anyone here ever had a similar experience, or known someone who did? If so, how did it happen, and what was the end result?"
How to handle being on-call overnight for new job?,"Have a job where I am required to be on-call overnight for 4 days a week, every 2-3 weeks. I would be responding to nuisance complaints that may originate from a construction site that my company operates, and attempting to determine if indeed our site is responsible. Keep in mind that these overnight duties are in addition to my generally office-based 9-5 job duties.

I have anxiety issues, and I can see myself lying awake at night for hours, waiting for the call to come. Then when it does, I'll be tired and miserable and not do a good job. Not to mention that driving alone while tired to a site in the middle of nowhere at 1am could definitely be a safety hazard.

The anxiety and anticipation is really eating at me, but I feel I have no choice but to do this as I really need this job. I'm afraid that if I ask to taken off the on-call schedule, I could get let go and replaced by someone better able to handle this part of the job. Not to mention I'd feel terrible to put this extra burden on my coworkers who rotate these duties with me."
Preemployment drug test for nicotine,"Hello, I don't know if this is the correct page to ask this question but here goes.

After completing my interview on Friday I got a call today to fill out all the paperwork since I got the job. They then sent me an order for a drug test that needs to be completed in 24 hours, easy pass since I dont do drugs, but then I saw that they test for nicotine I guess because it's a hospital. I haven't smoked a cigarette in a month and have a prescription from my doctor for nicotine patches which I used as prescribed. 

If nicotine shows on my drug test will they not hire me even if I have a prescription for the patches?

Thank you for any advice."
My boss is a lunatic - she’s been contracting herself every other day.,"LAST WEEKS POST: 

My boss gave me a shitty 30 day review due to things not being the way she wants them... she never once sat down to train me to do anything. Not entirely sure how to handle it moving forward.

I work for the public defenders office and began July 29th, two weeks after I went on vacation for two weeks (this was known at my time of hire), I also had a few orientation days. So at best, I’ve worked 36 full days.  The county requires 6 months probation for everyone. 

I was hired because of having knowledge and experience with the programs they use. I have NO knowledge of their procedures. I’ve essentially been fed to the wolves and I’ve been figuring things out on my own. 

Not one thing has been said to me by anyone on job performance. My boss (who I’m writing this post about) has complemented my intelligence and as of last week assigned me more work to do. When she assigned me this work, her and I had a meeting about how I felt about taking on another workload. NOT ONCE did she talk about my performance or work. 

Today, she asked if I had time to talk, I said sure. She then proceeds to tell me that she needs to see improvement across the board and began listing things I’ve done wrong. Then proceeds to tell me, “you know you’re still on probation right?” Needless to say, I was taken back, a lot. 

1. Never was a single thing said to me about my work for the past 30+ days. 
2. She never sat down with me ONCE to show me how to do anything or explain how their office procedure works. My thing is, how dare you say anything with YOU have yet to do a single thing with me and tell me it’s not how SHE wants it done?! 
3. She blamed my poor job performance on not following the sheets provided (which happen to be vaguely written “instructions”).  

Things she didn’t like: 
- How I close my files (the office wants it done a specific way) 
- One my spreadsheets were not being saved on the department drive, only my desktop. I thought it was being shared with everyone. No one said anything about not being able to see it!!! 
- How I type my transcripts for hearings. Apparently there’s a way that she wants that done as well. 

UPDATE TO LAST WEEK: 

I sat down with her the following day and she contradicted everything she said. She told me she didn’t expect me to learn everything in one day and she didn’t want me to get discouraged. We ended on a positive note. 

THIS WEEK: 

The end of last week and beginning of this week, I’ve been making it a point to go to her with questions and pointing out that I used her technique while doing this or that. Sometimes I’m just saying it even when I know what I’m doing so she knows I took it all seriously. 

Today, she randomly pulls me from my desk and says do you have a minute? I went into a conference room with her and the supervisor directly under her. She went on to tell me she’s going to do my two month review. She then noted that it’s about 2.5 weeks early because I had a scheduled vacation right after I started which she knew about before hiring me. 

The meeting essentially didn’t give me any feedback. She just asked me how I like it and how I get along with coworkers. I said nothing but positive things. She then goes on to tell me, “I think you’re too confident”. I must’ve given her a look of wtf and she said no, I really do. Zero explanation furthering that. 

We ended the meeting, there was nothing signed by me nor was anything provided for me to sign. She actually wrote nothing down during this meeting. 

I really think my job is in jeopardy here and I’m very nervous. I do what she tells me and it’s wrong, I don’t do what she tells me I’m wrong. I really don’t know what to do. 

Has anyone been in a similar boat? What do I do?"
Is poor job training pretty common now?,"My current job has a high caseload and sink or swim training. 

This article describes my current situation really well:

Everyone is nice so far but I specifically told them during the interview that I didn't want this kind of training style and they assured me that I would have more formal training. It's pretty big company too.

Starting to see why this decent paying job has a high turnover. I researched the company and the issues didn't concern me too much at the time but nothing indicated poor training until I actually started.

Is this issue pretty rampant now? This is my second office job with this kind of training. I'm extremely stressed out, struggling with all the deadlines and annoyed clients. I'm trying my best including working overtime. My only source of learning is pretty much to ""ask someone""."
I sipped once in weed vape pen two days ago and need to conduct a drug test.,"Hi all,

&#x200B;

I got an offer from a mortgage company and in order to finish the onboarding process, I need to submit a drug test.

&#x200B;

Here's the thing. I am not a smoker and I do not regularly smoke weed. I just sipped once from my friend's weed vape pen two days ago and I got an offer letter the next day. I am going out of town for the weekend and will be back in town on Monday and will be going to the site to submit the drug test.

&#x200B;

Will I fail the drug test? I was doing some research and it said substance will be in your system for a week (urine). I'm not sure if that applies to the non-smoker.

Hiring manager told me HR will call with next steps that include drug test...,"Is drug testing a part of on boarding? 
I know at my previous job I accepted a job offer and had to undergo a background check and drug testing.

* In the last jobs I had doing this type of work, I worked with a team of people. At this job I'm the only one. 

Some extra info. I was working for the past three years on the east coast doing video production for a non-profit until I was laid off. I've been without a video job for the past year and have been working doing freelancing and for restaurants in the mean-time.

Would you reject a job with a 2 hour commute (one-way) every two weeks?,"The job I’m offered has two offices. The main one is less than a 10 minute drive from my apartment. However they would also expect  me to commute 2 hours by car to their other office every two weeks. Whatever I do for them at one office they want me to do at the other. Some of their events I would hold could run late. So I would get home pretty late. I’m pretty worried about soaring gas prices, weather conditions, how beat up my car will get. 

Also, Is it reasonable to expect gas/mileage money in compensation for going to their second office?

Need to understand the process of gaining secret clearance (US),"I just got a job offer where the employer will sponsor me getting a secret level clearance.  I've heard it can take 6 months, other sources say up to 24 months.  The issue is they dropped the compensation when they gave me the offer and won't go back up to what we discussed when I started interviewing with them.  A secret clearance would add to my ability to get other jobs in the future, so this alone has value.  I'm thinking I could work for this company, initiate the process for a secret level clearance, and potentially leave soon after for a better paying job.  My question is whether this would end the process of me receiving the secret level clearance."

Firstly, i've had numerous job offer letters from big companies where no where on the letter mentioned anything about drug tests or drug policy or even the 4-letter word ""D-R-U-G"".  In these cases i was not drug tested.

Last week, my friend received a offer letter and within the letter she was asked (amongst other things) that as condition of employment to ""acknowledge"" the companies' drug-free workplace and drug & alcohol testing policies.  Now we discussed that because the word DRUG is mentioned, she will get tested prior to starting.  But then she asked friends of hers who work at the company and they were never drug tested prior to employment (or after).

Our question is, how do companies that state drug-free language in their offer letters decide who to drug test?  Do they flip a coin? Or hey you're African American- drug test!

&#x200B;

(A quick search shows some ppl were tested, some were not.  There were posts stating any major USA company will drug test you)"
Good news: I got a job! Bad news: I don’t have the job description and I’m too embarrassed to ask for it.,"So, I’ve been interviewing left and right for a year and a half and today I got an offer that I accepted! Trouble is, I don’t actually know the literal job description.

I applied for the position in November, and got a call last month to come in and talk with a hiring manager. To prep I tried looking at the job posting, but they yanked it off of indeed before they arranged for me to come in. I tried everything I could think of: looking at reviews from old employees, looking at my application on their website, trying to find similar postings, and I got nada. I went in expecting to do horribly but it went great! Talked about salary, the guy showed me some projects he’s working on, and he basically told me I was a front runner right then and there. Didn’t really feel like a good move to ask “By the way, what’s the job description again?”, especially since every time I tried to get out of my second shift job for the past year has resulted in me eating shit.

I’m pretty confident that I know the *basics* about what I’m going to be doing (I’ve been working in my industry for five straight years plus 2.25 years in college), so I’m not worried that I’m under-qualified or that I can’t perform up to expectations. But I also know having a job description is important long term for salary negotiations and other things, and knowing what was in that posting would settle my anxiety about leaving my first full-time job for something new. I’m playing around with the idea of asking their HR to forward me the old posting for my records but I’m already at severe levels of George Costanza and don’t want to look like more of an idiot than I already am. Any advice?"
Should I email another HR rep?,"I've been waiting to get a start date for my new job for about 5 weeks. The only reason I've waited this long is because it would be the best job I've ever had, in an industry that I'm super excited to get into. I've been trying to get in touch with one HR rep that I've met in person, and that I passed all my paperwork into.

So, I've emailed the first HR rep twice, the first time I got no response, the second time I emailed her after I was notified that I was registered w the state, and I wanted to know if there was anything else I should be doing. The response was very generic/vague. Pretty much just said my paperwork is under ""review."" Didnt answer my question, if anything it left me more confused than before.

This other rep I'm thinking about emailing has been out since july 3 and is back tomorrow. I emailed her once, and got am auto response saying shes out. Sucks, but whatever.

I have it all written out, pretty much saying that I got the register email, but I'm not sure what I should be doing now and that the first HR rep didnt really give me an answer. I also say that it's been a long process, I'm frustrated, and I'm going to considering another offer because I still dint have a start date and I would just like to know where my employment stands and what I should be doing now.

So, i guess my question is, is this like.... too Dramatic™? Part of me says be as assertive as I f-ing can be, but I'm really afraid of risking my chance at this job bc like I said, very good job in an industry I'm very passionate about and I really want the gd job 😭"
Working for a boss who’s remote,"I’m in the US and am about to start a new job in a few weeks. My boss is based out of the west coast and I’ll fly out there once every few months to meet the rest of the team.

Job background check help,"I recently was hired with a major airline and I have to do the background check. Well a year ago I got pulled over on my dirtbike for not having a endorsement and was given a ticket, and went to the courthouse and was required to pay a fine which I did. Well the company is looking more into it, and the way the background check came back it looks pretty bad like I don't have a driver licence or I was suspended in general. I mean it was literally was just a fine that I paid and I do currently have a motorcycle endorsement. Do you think this will ruin my employment I'm very worried and scared to lose a job over something every minor a year ago. They requested I sent a dmv report with my license status which I did do as well as sent my driver license in general. Do you think this will ruin my chances?"
What is a helpful way to approach letting my new boss know I have completed grad coursework that I did not include on my resume?,"Hi all, 

I recently accepted an offer of employment to work for a new org and am very excited to start my work. When I applied for the job, I did not include the graduate coursework that I've completed on my resume (I'm enrolled part-time in a grad program but do not yet have a degree). My reasons for leaving this coursework off were a) I don't have the degree yet, b) I wanted to keep my resume concise and focused on the job at hand (I have in the past been routinely guilty of including a lot of irrelevant info on my resume for the sake of ""painting a complete portrait of myself""), and c) while the degree is applicable in the general field I'm working in it doesn't really have much bearing on the job I've been hired for. 

At no point in the hiring process was there an opportunity to bring it up, because again, the degree has no relevance to the particular job I was hired for. The intent was simply to not take credit for something I haven't earned yet, because until I finish my coursework, as far as I'm concerned it's just continuing education. 

I don't anticipate the class I have scheduled this fall to interfere with my work at all (I've been working f/t and studying p/t for a while now and it's always been fine), and won't be requesting professional development funds for my class as it doesn't have bearing on my job (I already paid off the course and plan on using my PD money for job-related tasks). I thought it might be helpful to let my boss know in case an opportunity for a promotion comes up in the future.

What do you think is the best way to approach this?"
"I was employed because the company was expecting huge amount of projects, but now they are on hold and I've got nothing to do.","
As the title says, this job is kind of like my dream job and I was very happy to join the company.  But I started to  notice from the 1st week that  project manager and project directors keeps avoiding me when I go to them and asks them questions. So at the second week they informed me about projects being on hold and there is nothing they can do since as engineering department we only do what higher management asks us to do and told two people to give me a little work, which was practically 5 hours of irrelevant work in 2 months.

Anyway I've been trying to find work and checking and talking to GM, PM and project directors a lot asking for works directly and indirectly (trying to not be annoying) and updates about the projects. But 2 months has passed now and I've maybe worked 3 days totally out of these. I'M exhausted and bored to death at work from doing nothing all day especially right now since my orientation is finished and I literally have nothing to do, also it's an open office environment so I used to try and not hold my mobile at all and act like I'm working but recently I'm bored to death and started to listen to YouTube videos and watched them a little sometimes. 

I'm very paranoid and afraid that they are going to fire me because they don't need anymore which make the 10 hours sitting at office idle worse. I know worrying about things that are possible but out of my control is stupid but I can't stop myself. 

What should I do?"
"I have a written offer, but have not been given any paperwork. Should I quit my current job?","So I'm in a bit of an interesting situation. I currently work as a teacher and was given a written offer of employment at a school that pays much better about 6 weeks ago. The new school wants me to start working in about two week from now. The problem is that I have not received any kind of paperwork (W-4, I-9, etc.) from the new school yet. Should I put in my two-week notice at my current school and trust that the new school will follow through, or should I just keep working where I am at and not quit? 

I am not bound by any kind of contract as I am an at-will employee at my current school and I will be an at-will employee at the new school as well. I just don't want to put in my two-week notice and find out that the new school wasn't serious about hiring me and pulls the plug on me at the last moment. Is it normal for an employer to wait until the last moment to give out paperwork for a new hire?"
Does the VA hospital test potential employees for nicotine use?,"Hi all! I was wondering if anyone out there knows if the VA hospital does a drug & nicotine screening during the physical? I’m a current smoker, and though I do intend to quit, I would like to be able to use a nicotine replacement for a week or two. My physical, however, is next week.

Do you accept one job and then quit with as much grace as you can muster if you get your top choice? Do you try to stretch out the other jobs' hiring processes?

Withholding a weeks pay?,"I have been working at Sonics  for 3 weeks now and finally got paid today. Problem is they paid my first week paycheck, but not my second week. Why is that?  Also, you suppose to get paid every week."
My employer-to-be sent me my first project weeks before I start.,"  
I am currently an engineer at a company where I feel no growth or challenge.

I interviewed as a junior engineer with a company in California USA (I'm moving from a different city in CA) that I am really excited about. There is alot to be learned there. We settled on a salary and they are preparing me an offer that should be delivered in the next few days. Once that comes, I plan to put in my 2 weeks.

Today, my new company sent me my first project out of the blue. \[Mind you, I haven't even gotten an official offer letter yet. I don't start for 3 more weeks.\] The VP of Engineering sent me details of the project, who to coordinate with, expectations, etc. They said that this is urgent and extremely important for an expo they have coming up.

I asked them what is the start date of this project? They said ""We would like you to work on this officially once you start on 1/7. However if you have spare time now, you are welcome to work on it to get a head start. This project is a backup solution for our main project for \[expo\] which is extremely important for the company.""

How would you feel? What would you do? I have a full time job so I can't imagine working for no pay on a project in my free time for a company who hasn't sent me an offer letter. Is this a red flag?

Also, note that I feel it was tough for me to land a position I was this excited about."
2 job offers dilemma,"I received a job offer from company A a few weeks ago which I accepted because my contract work was coming to an end. I will be starting at company A next week. Lo and behold, I received an interview from company B, which I applied for during my job hunting period.  After interview and checking my references and background company B called me earlier this week and said they approved my position and verbally asked if I would accept. This is my dream government position and so I accepted and my start date is in mid September. Because it is government, it took them a while to go through my background check before they can approve me. I am still waiting for my offer letter, and the manager said to wait until next week. 

My dilemma is that I have not received an official offer letter from company B and so I feel like it’s not official yet and nothing is set in stone. However, given by how the manager communicated very thoroughly through every step of the application process and actually set a start date for me, I am pretty sure it’s official they are just waiting for their HR just as much as I am. 

I have not told company A that I will not be starting yet. On one hand, I would hate to start with company A for the few days then quit for company B. I don’t want to burn bridges. On the other hand, if I quit company A before I start just based on the fact that company B will extend an offer letter to me, and there is that small possibility the offer does not go through, I would end up with no jobs. I have been applying for over 6 months for jobs and I feel very fortunate to land two offers in a very saturated field, but it was still a very anxious period of my life. 

I am a fairly new grad (graduated in 2018) and my first job was a contract position, so I don’t have experience in these type of situations. I would very much appreciate your input. What would you do in my situation? Thank you in advance!"

Background checks and omitting short term jobs due to termination,"So I omitted a short term job from my resume due to termination for low performance. I never mentioned it, and it wasn't brought up during an interview. I currently have this temporary job offered to me, so the background check will be done by the temp agency. Do you think they will dig extensively for your entire employment history, or will it be like a W2 upload of documents to the temp agency's background check website just to verify the jobs on your resume (every other job I had was good)?"
"I turned in all the IegaI paperwork after they offered me the job,but I haven't heard anything back? What should I do?

I have no clue what they all are needed for). Then, she said she'd like me on by Friday, if I can get the IegaI paper work done in time, but she never told me a time, and I don't have a uniform or anything. What should I do? Should I just wait? I mean it's been a day, and I don't want to miss my first day, if she actually did schedule me for Friday...

Went to my first day of work and was sent back home.,"I was hired last Tuesday as an entry-level data analyst at a small company (~50 employees). The CEO handled all the interviews and hiring process, so I'm guessing there isn't a formal HR team in the company. Last Tuesday, the CEO told me to start the following Monday, yesterday, and to give him a call on Friday to confirm my start date. Here is when everything went wrong.

I soon realized that Monday was Memorial Day and wasn't sure if the CEO had forgotten that it was a holiday or if the office was open. I planned on asking him during the confirmation call on Friday but he didn't pick up all three times. So I sent him an email on Friday but never got a response even till today.

I went to work yesterday, just in case, but the whole building was closed for memorial day. I was honestly fine and went in again today. I was then told that the guy responsible for my training called in sick and told me to go back home. I asked one of the directors there if she was aware of my hiring but she said no. I'm guessing the CEO didn't tell anyone that I was hired. So no one expected me to be there. She also told me that the CEO would be out this whole week because he's attending a conference. Then she said she'll straighten things out and give me a call later today but I never received a phone call.

I'm now unsure when or if I will even start working there. I rejected one interview after being hired and received one more interview request over the weekend but can't give them any response because I'm not sure what'll happen at this place. I'm pretty sure I was hired here because they deleted the job listing on Indeed after hiring me. I like this place but this whole hiring process has been very frustrating."
"Accepted public service job with the city, no word from HR yet","Hi!

I accepted a job with the city on May 13th over the phone, and then was told that HR would be contacting me shortly afterwards. I followed up a few days after (the 15th?), and was told that they just finished signing the paperwork for my position. Person told me that I should receive correspondence from HR by the end of next week.

End of next week rolls around today, and still no e-mail from HR. I left the manager a voicemail, but I'm not expecting to hear back until next week because of the Memorial day weekend.

I am kind of a paranoid person, and am already thinking that the offer was probably withdrawn, however I understand that public service jobs probably go through an extensive process.

Any thoughts/personal experiences to share? Thanks!

TL;DR I accepted a job with the city over the phone almost 2 weeks ago, no word from HR yet despite follow ups with the department manager."
Hiring process is very slow is this normal?,"Had two interviews with this company and manager is thrilled to have me on board. She said HR will call me tomorrow which was yesterday.

Is HR usually slow?

Relocation,"Hello R/jobs,

I've just received all of my on boarding papers and signed my job offer for a new job in a different state. I can't really pass up on it, as it's a perfect situation and a new fresh career making money I can't make where I'm at.

The problem is that the company does not offer any form of relocation for my position, and will not budge for me. I've done all the negotiating I can, but its done. I don't have the savings anymore, after being unemployed for a few months early last year. I've worked my way up from $10/hr to 18/hr, but haven't managed to really save anything significant.

My dream job is a real nightmare. Am I being unreasonable or is my frustration justified?,"Hey, guys. I’ve cried once in my adult life and today was almost the second. 

I’m in marketing, for added context

I took my dream job, or so I thought, 2 weeks ago and was stoked to begin. Everything was going pretty well, but in a couple weeks in, it all seems to be falling apart. The first red flag is that there was no formal training besides a short skype (it’s a remote job). I was left to my own devices to learn the very complex systems they use. 

I was hired at a very busy time of year so I’ve had to learn while putting out a shit ton of projects. I’ve been forced to learn by mistake and my boss is bombarding with criticism all day because I’m making mistakes (because I was never trained). Today, HR held a meeting with me and subtly said if I didn’t greatly improve I’ll be let go by next week. I’ve been here literally 2 weeks...what the fuck. 

In those two weeks I’ve completed every task and even did a co-workers tasks while she was on leave. I’ve been struggling to stay ahead so I’ve been working 12+ hour days to keep up. I’m exhausted. 

This is a nightmare and I will be horribly ashamed if I leave this job. But seeing how burnt out everyone is and the insane hours they work, I’m learning that the good pay might not be worth it. 

Anyone else go through this?"
Tips for first few weeks on the job? Really overwhelmed.,"I just started my first full time role out of grad school and I'm so overwhelmed with everything. Some things that are overwhelming me that I need help with: 
1. I feel really comfortable with the topics I'm working with-they're pretty specific to what i researched and studied in grad school, but there's a lot of company specific lingo I don't know, and I'm having a hard time figuring out what are all the projects my team is doing. 
2. Logistics-I don't have a routine yet, and it's stressing me out. I don't wake up at a set time, or know when I can leave work. 
3. Downtime-I overbooked myself and was out every night this week until 10/11, but I'm nervous I won't be able to make time to see friends and workout."
Almost there... but very SLOW recruiter,"I have a return offer with a company I did very well at as an intern.

My start date is in a couple days and I still have not gotten to finish their onboarding process or drug test. I have been emailing my recruiter about once a week for updates and he seems to be going at a snail's pace. Since until last week, he kept pushing the date (I'll get it to you by July, I'll get it to you by start of August, I'll get it to you by next week, etc.) and finally sent me the internal job application I could apply to so they could send me the appropriate steps to finish. However he went MIA again for 3 days when my start date is in 3 business days.. he hasn't responded to my email since and I'm wondering what to do now. Granted his average response time in the past has been probably 3-5 business days (still extremely slow) but given the time constraints we have now I thought 3 was still pretty long. I only have his e-mail and not phone number.

I do have the e-mail of my direct supervisor and the email/phone of the recruiter's direct supervisor (head recruiter). Should I contact my manager and cc the recruiter? Or is that a nono? I want to convey the urgency I have while not making it seem like I'm being rude/calling someone out. Any help would be appreciated as this process has been frustratingly and needlessly last minute."
"Finally landed a job, but...","Firstly, I am very thankful for this sub.  Cheers all around.  Lurking here was an absolute lifeline.

Finally, the but part.  It is on a condensed schedule, so three twelves from morning to night and four twelves every other week.  I'm scared!  I'm so used to sitting around doing very little.  My sleep routine is kinda sucky, waking up around 10 and going to bed around midnight.  I'm also out of shape by being so sedentary.  So jumping into this type of schedule freaks me out, man!

Any advice on how to acclimate myself for success?  Advice for getting through twelve hour shifts?

Haven't heard from my boss in weeks. What should I do?,"I'm currently a Master's student starting a JD in the fall at a nationally accredited research university in the US. For reference, I also did my undergrad at this school.

Last quarter, a (full/tenured) professor at the school I'm matriculating at in the fall hired me as a part-time research assistant. He hired me primarily to work this summer, but my employment technically started in May. My employment paperwork has been successfully processed since then, and I even have an online timecard for my work. However, I have not heard a peep from him since the middle of May. About a month later in the middle of June, I asked him some questions, including for approval on some hours I did during the academic year, about the job via email. He has not responded to my inquiry. I sent him a followup email this past weekend.

What should my next steps be? I've worked many jobs in the past years, and I have never had this happen to me. I feel irresponsible for not being more proactive (such as perhaps calling him), but I'm not sure the onus is on me. Thanks in advance for your time and energy spent answering my question.

Question about Social Security Card as an Identifier?,"Many companies today want to actually see your actual Social Security Card as part of their hiring process.  I get it:  ""Under his Eye"".

I heard on talk radio that some companies/agencies will not accept the older Social Security card that states on the bottom ""Not to be used for identification purposes"". These are typically cards from your parent's generation.

Can anybody bring me up-to-date and either confirm or deny this?  Thank You."
Move on or wait it out?,"So I've been job hunting for almost a year now. I have gotten an interview at a nice geochem company (my specific area of study) and they offered me the job. At the same time I interviewed for another geochem company that offered slightly less pay but better benefits and they also offered me the job. I took the second job 2 weeks ago and turned down the first offer.

Today I emailed them to see when we can talk start date, and I got this ""I talked to (manager) yesterday, they are completely booked with guys for (my specific position) unfortunately. He doesn’t know when it will open up so I can’t give you a timeline for when they can get you started. They have openings for compliance positions and I tried pushing to get you in there but he doesn’t think you would be a good fit on that side. As of right now I don’t have any other positions open that you would qualify for so it’s kind of a waiting game now unless you were to find something else on your own. I apologize for the inconvenience.""

So do I just move on or wait it out? Kind of upset and angry that they would offer me the job and then say they dont have an open position at this time.

Thanks in advance!"
Employee Handbook red flags?,"I'm in the process of leaving the job I've had since I was 17, never had another. I just finished e-orientation for taxes and such last night, and I got a digital copy of the new companies employee handbook, which is. Really strict.

The job I'm leaving was pretty lax, the handbook was mostly about behavior on the clock, appearance, and attendance.

In the new company handbook there are clauses about rights to search my personal items, with instant  termination for refusal.

Writeups for foul language. (In a kitchen setting? Are they serious?)

Regulations against drinking alcohol when off duty.

There's some other oddities, but these stuck out the most to me.
Granted I was reading at 1:30 in the morning, and I'll just have to wait and see what's enforced, but are these pretty typical clauses or are they as unusual as they sound?"

Signed a contract for a new teaching job. Went into the contract signing with my previous contracts in hand and you should too.,"This is going to be something that will directly apply to teachers, but could also apply to anyone else. I was recently offered a job in a public school district; and as a teacher who was hired into a public district, your salary is based on your experience. In my situation, it's specifically based on the number of ""contracted years of service"" you have.   


I went in today to sign my contract and on the contract it had my salary, as well as my specific ""step"" on the salary schedule that matched my experience. Only, it didn't actually match my experience. It was 2 years short. For some that may not be a big deal, but in this case it was a $4000+ difference in salary. The district I was being hired into did not count my previous time as a ""student support specialist"" at a private school as actual ""teaching experience."" Luckily, I had been through this once before and was wise enough to have my contract from that job on hand.   


I said to the HR person that my experience on the contract didn't match my actual experience. They said, ""Yeah, when you were a 'student support specialist,' we weren't sure if that was a contracted teaching position or not."" I replied with, ""It actually was a contracted teaching position and luckily, I have my contract from that position with me today."" I handed it to the HR director, and within 5 minutes she had my new contract updated to the correct experience and the salary to match it. It was very easy for me to print it out, but printing it out earned me $4000+ all because I was prepared.   


So if you're going for a teaching position (or any position that bases your salary off of your years of service), bring your previous contracts. It may cost you 5-cents per page to print, but can secure you thousands and set you up to be at a higher ""step"" in the salary schedule."
"New Job, some concerning policies","Hey all.


Started a new job recently. It's working for a community action group (don't want to say the name, its a small-ish company)

So, the job includes door knocking on high rise, generally low income apartment buildings to talk to residents, which is fine. 

However I was led to believe that this was being done in pairs (it is not)

So for 5 hours a day, I'm alone and being explicitly told my first goal is to 'Get in the Door' of strangers apartments (with quotas). Am I right to be concerned about safety, particularly as a woman? 

I was told there was alot of training, but after about two hours of some situational bits yesterday, I started door knocking, alone. 

Other 'yellow flags' include:

-There is no contract, or clear definition of the role. 

-Pay is ambiguous ""it's salaried, works out to 15 an hour"" but I haven't seen that in writing anywhere, and 32k-something works out to under 15 an hour (what they pay part time workers) 

- I'm worried about the cops being called on me for soliciting in a building. We don't have permission to be in there, and are instructed to just follow a resident when they open the main door. I asked the main organizer if they had ever been arrested or had the the cops called on him while doing the job, and the question wasn't answered. (Particularly anyone with Ontario Law knowledge know the answer to this one?)

- I would learn to deal with this one, but basically the hours are different than advertised. 12-9pm, with some weekends. (I have a much better paying weekend job, with a contract) 

-It is a preformance based job with quotas. (Re they can fire me if I don't meet those quotas) I have worked with quotas before. But I've know what was expected and what was the threshold I needed to meet. That's not the case here, after asking multiple times. 

-Women who work mobile jobs- how do you use the bathroom, or change tampons? These buildings aren't always around a coffee shop or Macdonald, and we aren't technically allowed to leave the building incase we can't get back in. 

Really I'm thankful to have something full-time after 4 months of apply and just scrapping by on other gigs, but the above really worry me. 

Thoughts? Has anyone had a job like this before?

Ideal Job Getting Pushy,"I've been with my incumbent role (Company A) for close to four years.  We were acquired a couple of years ago, and some functions have been integrated, resulting in layoffs in my company.  Because I've been the last person left in my group for well over two years, I figured it was a matter of time.  Just before the holiday, I received an offer (Company B) with a signing bonus (20% of base) and submitted the due diligence paperwork a couple of days before Christmas.

We come back from the holidays, and sure enough that first Friday, I was advised my position was going away at the end of February.  Because my responsibilities were being split six ways, there was a sizable transition bonus to stay aboard through the end of February on top of severance.  Between reviewing the agreements with the attorney last week and making a transition plan, I hadn't had a chance to follow up with Company B on their status.  Of note, Company A is willing to pay out the retention bonus in full if I get things transitioned out this month.

This past Friday, I get an email from the internal recruiter at Company B, wishing me luck on my first day Monday (today).  Of course, this was news to me.  It appears that someone on the Company B onboarding team dropped the ball and never circled back with me on the start date, where to show up, et al.  

They then wanted to make a first day the 21st (which they neglected to see was a holiday), which makes for a short-notice resignation.  I've pushed back for a 28th start date, which lets me give a two-week notice today, get things properly transitioned out and retain eligibility for that transition bonus.

As of this morning, Company B is still insistent on getting started next week, because they've aligned me with a project.  I'm of the opinion that their internal fuck-ups are not my problem, but also don't want to burn a bridge here and risk losing at least one of the two bonuses.

Any thoughts/feedback would be great.

I started a job hunt and found one with a large company in the same industry.

I have some online training links that I have done and that has been about it. I sit in silence and nothing seems to happen.

Feedback at new jobs?,"I've been at my new job for about a month and have barely gotten any feedback besides my boss telling me she really likes how autonomous I am, and occasionally saying ""good job"" when I complete a task (maybe 2-3 times).

I am about to go on a trip overseas for 2 weeks (it was already planned before I got this job and I disclosed it in the interview so it's not a problem) and plan to ask her about my performance so far when I return, but in the meantime I'd really like to know what the norm for the first month is.

(Edit: I don't have any reason to think I'm in trouble or have done anything badly (other than taking longer than I would have liked to complete a task one day, but she didn't say anything about it), but at my last job I was told I was doing well for a while until the story very suddenly changed, so I'm paranoid for any sign that I may need to be concerned.)"

Has anyone gone through the Federal Contractor background check process lately?,"My husband is in the process of going through the background check to start work for a federal contractor.

He second guesses every form he fills out and the company hiring him can't help him because it's federal forms.

Feedback from going through thousands of applications from reddit,"Hi Jobseekers,

We've already had three job openings at reddit this past year, including this one for [sales support position posted today](http://redd.it/1wwfgi). We've had great success finding awesome candidates in /r/ForHire and relevant local subreddits, but we're seeing some common mistakes over and over again. I thought I'd share some of the most common ones we've seen in the thousand or so applications we've triaged this year.  

Hope these tips are helpful in your search.  Will answer any questions in the comments:

* Name your damn files. If you are attaching or uploading files (resume/cover letter/etc) put your name in filename. I now have 200 files on my computer called resume.doc, and a bunch with even worse labels like summer_2013_webjobs_resume.pdf.  

* Don't apply for a full time job while you are in high school or college unless you have a really good reason. Appreciate the confidence, but you're most likely wasting both of our time.  

* If you have non-traditional experience that you feel would help you do the job you're applying for, that's excellent, but it's up to you to explain how the experience would relate. Don't assume people will understand jargon from a different industry in your resume no matter how impressive. Make your case in the cover letter and resume itself. have a friend who is not in the industry read over it and make sure they understand any jargon etc.        

* Showing a sense of humor can be great in the right context, but if you have any doubts, err on the side of caution. A bad joke can be a deal killer.  

* Speak directly to the job description being offered. It's often clear from the resume and cover letter that applicants didn't really read the job description. Are you right for this particular job, or are you just interested in the company, location, etc.?  

* Don't talk about how you really wanted to be a film director, game designer, zoo keeper, etc but just couldn't cut it (unless there was like a career ending injury or something else outside your control). Everyone can relate, but it's not really your best look.  

* Spelling and grammar matter. You don't have to be 100% perfect, but sloppiness is a killer.  

* Even if the job is open to relocation, local candidates will most likely be favored. If you are not local, be convincing about how relocating won't be an issue.   

* Get someone to look over your resume and anything else in your application. A second opinion is always a good idea.  

* If there are truly optional fields, you should have a good reason to skip. Why pass up a chance to make your case?  

* If you are not applying for an hourly job, don't include what you made hourly for past positions on your resume.  

edit: Spelling and thought of more"
Why your job search isn't working,"As a recruiter who stumbled upon this subreddit a month or so ago, I have seen a lot of the same issues come up time and time again that lead people to unsuccessful job searches. I wanted to share the biggest items, and some suggestions for those who have been perpetually searching for awhile to see if some of these problems could be solved, and everyone can land their next job. Job searching is such a mentally, physically, and emotionally draining experience. Your livelihood is at stake, and it's really easy to shut down after awhile.

**Problem #1: Lack of networking, resume blasting**

I often see posts with ""I have sent 100, 200, 500, 1000, etc., resumes and have had no luck so far!"" Part of this has to do with a sense of entitlement. People have degrees and work experience, and by sending a resume, if they are vaguely qualified (or feel they are) for a position, they feel everything should fall into place. 

Most positions I recruit for garner 50-200 applications for one opening. Honestly, after removing the under-qualified people, most resumes tend to look the same. A few will stand out, but a majority are at about the same experience and skill level. Most recruiters juggle 15-20 open positions at a time. It is impossible, and inefficient to interview all of them, beyond the ones that really stick out. So what do we do in situations like that? We look at our own network, and for referrals.

Say you have a high performing employee that comes to you with a great candidate for one of your open positions. You trust them since they are the ideal employee. Recruiting is all about trying to remove as much uncertainty about candidates as possible. If they vouch for this person, chances are they are just as good, if not better. I almost always will give referrals at least a phone interview, even if they may be a bit underqualified from an education/experience standpoint. Why? Because if they get the respect of a current, high performing employee, they probably have the drive to work hard for any gaps they may have. I'll take those top few resumes, plus referrals, and interview those individuals. This means if you don't stick out beyond the typical person, or know someone within the organization, you are already way behind.

What's the takeaway? Make sure your resume is top-notch. Get HR professionals, and those working in your field to review your resume constantly. Make sure you tailor your resume to each position you apply for. Stop blasting resumes and find positions that you want the most and focus on those. If you're sending 500 resumes, you obviously don't want a specific position with a specific company, you just want a job. That often shows through. Network constantly within and outside of your organization. Remember, networking isn't about looking for something, it's about spending time and essentially creating a friendship. Use your company, past companies, professional organizations, HR professionals, and company executives as the best place to start. LinkedIn helps a lot. See if you have a connection at the company with an open position, and reach out to them.

**Problem 2: ""I get interviews, but never hear back""**

If you get interviews, but never get beyond the first round, this tells you two things. One, your resume is good enough to get you an interview. Celebrate and recognize that. Second, your interviewing skills are obviously lacking. Ask HR professionals or managers within your field to help you with a mock interview. Bring them the job description, and they can ask questions that will closely match what you can expect for a certain position. Find someone that will be brutally honest, and be open to their criticisms. Work on your responses and mindset, and continue until you receive mostly positive feedback. 

Good recruiters should give you a deadline of when you can expect to hear back. If they don't, be sure to ask at the end of the interview. If it's been 24 hours after you were told you would hear back, an e-mail or call is appropriate. Be proactive, and don't wait on a company. The golden rule of job hunting is to work like you don't have anything in the works until you have an offer in your hands. If a company isn't getting back to you after multiple attempts, it may not be the type of place you want to work. 

**Problem 3: Poor understanding of recruitment process**

There is a lot of bad advice across places like this subreddit, the blogosphere, and the web in general. When reading articles offering advice, make sure it is from someone who has interviewed people over a long period of time, and/or was in a position to give offers and make hiring decisions. While advice from those who have recently had a successful search can be helpful, keep in mind every position, company, and location looks for different things. Don't overthink things. There's no magic set of actions or words you can use to get a job. It ALWAYS comes down to who meets the qualifications, who has preferred qualities that we are looking for, and who is the best cultural fit for the company. 

Speaking of qualifications, a lot of people are saying apply to everything, even if you're not qualified. Most of the time this is poor advice. I never put required experience on a job posting that isn't necessary for the position. Most companies post required and preferred experience. Required means just that, you need these skills, experiences, and education requirements to successfully perform well in the role. It isn't something we guess, there is a lot of thought and research done before posting an opening. There may be minor areas that companies are willing to forgive if you have a really strong preferred skill, but no manager I work with is going to invest in someone under qualified. Remember volunteer experience, or even some duties for a non-related position can count as experience if you can show how it gained that skill that they are looking for. It doesn't always need to be for pay.

The best thing to do is to put yourself in the recruiter's shoes. Look at the job description. If you needed to hire this person, where would you look? What type of person would you look for? What would you want to see on a resume? You need to emulate that person. Know the company, know the job, provide examples of how your experiences meet those qualifications. 

**Problem 4: Letting failure bring you down**

Rejection is hard. When you get that letter, ""we are pursuing other candidates at this time,"" it is hard to deal with. Being told you're not good enough is hard. Or is it? When we send rejection e-mails out, it does not always mean you weren't qualified. Remember we receive hundreds of applications for 1 open position. To say only 1 person could do the job out of 100-200 would be a lie. The only issue is that we have to choose only one person for the opening. Use this as an opportunity by saying, ""Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate the opportunity to learn more about your organization, and I thank you for your consideration. Your company is one I greatly respect, and would love to work for someday. I hope you will keep me in mind for future opportunities with your company!"" Keep in mind that sometimes you aren't qualified. But if you've had a few interviews, and someone else is chosen, it is likely that someone was just a little bit better in some way, or had some preferred skill that you may not have. Using it as a networking opportunity can help you down the road if you have left a positive impression. 

After 6 months to a year of no luck, it can take a huge toll on you. Speak with someone that you can vent with. Seek professional help if needed. Keep yourself healthy. It will be hard to come off positively in an interview if you are too pessimistic and depressed. Make sure you are okay with you, so you can present the best version of yourself.



And most importantly, best of luck! Always be prepared to know what you would do tomorrow if you lost your job today. Hopefully this helps some of you, I'll answer any questions you have. Sorry for the length!




**TL;DR:** A lot of weird advice exists here and all over the internet. Take with a grain of salt. Put yourself in a recruiter's shoes when looking, and emulate the person you would look for if you needed to fill the position. Network, network, network. Be proactive and don't wait on anyone or anything, keep moving forward. Accurately assess your successes and gaps, and fix gaps to improve your chances. Don't do it alone, utilize the many resources out there at your disposal.

**Final Edit:** Thank you to everyone who was open minded and participated in a respectful manner. It's too bad that those trying to help receive treatment like this due to a job title and a misunderstanding of their field. Due to the overwhelming amount of negativity going on in this thread, I am going to ask that if you have serious questions regarding your job search, that you send them via PM, and I will do my best to respond timely.  

I get that a lot of people out there are frustrated due to the state of the job market. If it is therapeutic for those unfairly being unemployed so long to take their frustrations out on recruiters, so be it. I am glad this post can at least provide that. Please remember while job hunting is draining and difficult, blaming others, or the system, isn't going to provide job offers. Please keep that goal in mind, and focus your energy on steps to help you find the next step in your career.

For each negative comment, there were also many engaging, helpful questions asked by participants. Thank you for those, and I hope this post can provide some ideas to change things up to generate new leads for your job hunt. "
Knowing When To Quit Your Job,"I felt it was appropriate to share some guidelines to consider when you feel it's time to leave your job and start over. This list is a combination of my personal experience and articles I've read in making my decision to leave. When we're so comfortable in a job that we've been at for a few years, it is sometimes easy to be deceived that we're in a ""good place"". Just like any bad relationship, it's hard to break up when you're comfortable.

A quick background of my career history - I was a paralegal for a few years looking to change law firms due to boredom and unhappiness. Was offered a non-legal position through a temp agency for a job I did not apply for, but this new position resulted in a  free ride to law school and an entryway to an attorney position with the business. Would've never had this opportunity if I didn't take the leap of faith to quit.

**1) Quit your job if you're more often bored/dissatisfied with your days at work** 
Regardless of how happy you are at your job, we all have bad days. However, if it gets to a point where the bad days outweigh the good and you start dreading going to work because you can foresee a bad day, then it's time to reconsider your job.

I used to find myself throwing tantrums on Sunday evenings because I could not stand the thought of going to work on Monday. 

**2) Quit your job if you're underpaid**
My husband used to always ask me why I was settling for only $11/hour for a paralegal position. I used to continuously tell him that it was a good place to be and I was learning new things. His rebuttal was simply, ""How do you know other places can't offer the same but for more money?"" Essentially, he was right. How can you really say your position is ""good"" if you haven't seen what else is out there. I now make nearly triple the amount I used to and it is definitely a better place to work and it is definitely a job I keep learning in. I would have never known about this position if I didn't step out of my comfort zone.

**3) Quit your job if you're being verbally abused by your boss** 
When we're too comfortable in our position, it's as if office etiquette flies out the door because coworkers start feeling like family. Regardless how close your peers become, the office is still the office. My previous boss used to cuss up a storm and emotionally abuse us when our working performance was not up to par. I truly believed this was just how a typical law office was like and any ""good"" company would push their employees in the same fashion. Wrong! I now work in a Fortune 500 company and no one would dare treat their employees like such.  

**4) Don't be afraid of the unknown** 
What if I don't like my new job? What if I lose a good opportunity here? Stop thinking of the negative and think ""What if I never made the change?"" If you're even in a place where you're daydreaming of a new job, then maybe that's where you need to go. The change in my life started with simply applying to as many legal jobs, but the search concluded with a job that was offered to me through a temp agency. Even though the position had nothing to do with my career choice, I still chose not to fear the unknown. You never know what's on the other side of the road you'll take, so the best way to take that route is to simply go for it and don't look back.

**TL;DR - Quit your job if you're bored, underpaid, and abused. Don't be scared :)**"
A not so simple: Job Application Guide!,"**Tl;dr** [info-graphic summary]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/3yuhnucmsey3alb/INFOGRAPHIC.pdf?dl=0)

**About Me**  

I am a Certified HR Professional with over 6 years of experience.  
Much of my experience has been in recruitment (*I am not a recruiter though*). What this means is that I am the person creating the jobs themselves, creating the postings for the jobs, receiving the applications, screening the applications & applicants, and conducting interviews with / coaching the managers on selection.  

I had many friends and colleagues approach me, throughout my career, asking for advice about their applications and job search *(engineers, nurses, pharmacists, business admin, and various entry level positions.)* ; all were successfully placed after receiving my advice within a reasonable time period (all under 6 months, within a labour market with an average 7.6% unemployment rate over the last 5 years).   

Most recently I was laid off from a job at the end of July (summer is slow job season), and got myself placed within 3.5 weeks after my lay-off.      

I've been reading through many posts about people sending applications and not getting any responses so I decided to create this guide to job search, application writing and submission.  

Hope someone finds it useful.  

**Guide Summary**  

Remember, HR is not a science it’s an art. The purpose of this guide is to give you the knowledge that I have from HR’s side, relevant to screening and selection so that you can better your application and thereby increase your chances of being selected.  

This guide is broken down into 3 segments:  

* Applicant
* Job posting
* Application  

In the applicant segment I go over competencies and core competencies.  This covers your strengths as an applicant and what you should focus on in your application (cover letter and resume).  

In the job posting segment we will dissect a sample job posting and go through what is what and where to look for key information when gearing up your application for submission.   

In the application segment we will cover what you should include, what you should not include and typical do-s and don’t-s when it comes to your application.  
.  
.  

**Applicant**  
“What I can offer”

So you graduated university and are out to look for a job, you think you’ve had no prior job experience and that the road ahead is simply a dead end to part-time work in a field that is unrelated to what you studied.  

Or you’re simply a person who just got laid off and is not having any luck with your job search. Feeling that the world betrayed you and that you’re worthless?  

**FALSE, YOU SHOULDN'T**  

First things first, start with your attitude – you need to be in the right mindset when applying for jobs. You need to be confident but not cocky. Also, self-loathing applicants reflect that in their applications – trust me.  

Before we talk about your strengths, we need to cover what **competencies** are.  
Understanding competencies is important, because that’s what determines what the right **“fit”** is for a company.  

>Competencies are the measurable or observable knowledge, skills, abilities, and behaviours (KSABs) critical to successful job performance. Choosing the right competencies allows employers to: Plan how they will organize and develop their workforce.  
[Source](http://www.hr.wa.gov/WorkforceDataAndPlanning/WorkforcePlanning/Competencies/Pages/default.aspx)  

So companies will be looking for a specific set of KSAs (competencies) from their applicants. What this means is that you should *understand your own competencies and their limitations*. People faking it and lying in their job applications are easy to spot to be honest, and get weeded out very quickly. If you somehow slip through and make it, expect a very hard time in the job you landed with false information, unless you ninja your way through and manage to pick up the skills needed as you go. But be honest and ask yourself, do you really want to suffer through that, or would you rather be in a job that is rewarding in terms of experience and brings peace of mind?  

Those competencies are very specific in what they are. So how do employers define those competencies?  

Simple, competency dictionaries – here is my [favourite one](http://campusservices.harvard.edu/system/files/documents/1865/harvard_competency_dictionary_complete.pdf)  

Look through it and understand what you are putting on your resume. For example, when a company asks for good communication skills they typically want what’s in that dictionary. The dictionary will also go through “Key Actions” and “Job Activities” that demonstrate what good communication is. This dictionary is a sample one and does not contain everything and anything of course. Use google.  

**TIP**: Transferable skills, you have them and they cross over nicely to many fields or industries - if you worked as a barista, for example, you have been developing certain competencies: verbal communication, organization and time management, contributing to team success, stress tolerance etc. Those are applicable to working in an office environment, trust me.
  
So now that you understand what competencies are, take a look at what you’ve done in the past in terms of work experience and schooling. Ask yourself these questions:  

* How have they shaped and developed your competencies throughout your life and career?
* What can you do well?  

**Your cover letter and resume need to convey your competencies, VERY CLEARLY.**  Here is the ideal layout of what you should include in your cover letter  to showcase your competencies:  
.  
.  

-----------------------------------------------  
  
Date  
Name  

Dear XXX,  
It is with great interest that I submit my application for XXX position with your awesome company, your company is great because (**blah blah blah I’ve done my research about your company i.e. I’m not writing a generic letter here**) etc.  
  
What I can offer / what sets me ahead of other applicants is XXX (**list your competencies here, talk about them and about how they can benefit the employer, best yet talk about how they match what they are looking for in a candidate**) etc.  
  
My experience, schooling and qualifications have prepared me for this shit, I am awesome and you will love me immediately I promise (**paraphrased, do not include that as is**).  
  
I look forward to further discussing my qualifications with you, I can be contacted at XXX.  
  
Signed,  
  
-----------------------------------------------  
.  
.  

**Job Posting**  
“What they’re looking for”  

So, now we move on to looking at what a job posting will have and what we need to look for when applying for a job.  
Let’s go with [this sample](http://www.hr.umich.edu/empserv/department/newsletter/sampleposting.pdf) for now.  
You will notice some key elements that you need to look at:  

* Typical work duties  
* Minimum qualifications (must haves)  
* Desired qualifications (nice to haves)  

For *typical work duties*, you need to read carefully through them and start mapping your experience and expertise to those duties, relative to your competencies.  

For minimum qualifications or MUST haves, you need to make sure that you have those. If it says min 5 yrs experience, you better have that or make one hell of an argument for that. If you do not have the min qualifications DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  

**TIP**: Students, your degree counts as condensed experience! For all those of you who say: “Scumbag employer says entry level but requires experience” **YOUR DEGREE IS YOUR EXPERIENCE!**  

For nice to haves or *desired qualifications*, make sure you check off as many of those as you can – not having them will not impede your ability to do the job, but having them will tell the employer that you can definitely do the job easier.  

**TIP**: What this typically means is that, as an employer I’m willing to train you on how to do this but it would be nice if you already knew how to.  
.  
.  

**Application**  
“Why you should hire me”  

So now that we understand what you as an applicant can offer and what the employer is looking for. Let’s communicate that to them!  

Do:  

* Include sample work done prior, as long as it is relevant!  
* Be concise but don’t skimp out on the important information  
* Review your application  
* Make sure that you have the minimum qualifications  
* Make sure that your resume’s layout is appropriate: clear font, legible, appropriate for the job  
* Place your strengths first, if you’re a student – education goes first with a summary of what you learnt in each class that is applicable in terms of competencies. If you are experienced, place your work history first (chronologically, summarize the relevant material but don’t skimp out on including juicy details)  
* Be honest with yourself, always  
* Use action words: achieved, organized, obtained
* Use [smart](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~hrs/profldev/performance_management/performance_objective.html) when communicating your achievements  
**Example of SMART**:  
Successfully executed and supported an effective XXX strategy to achieve XXX within X time period.    

Don’t:  

* Include protected property, any work that you’ve done for a company while under their employ will TYPICALLY belong to them, check your previous contract that you signed – you can get sued if you violate it
* Include company logos or indicators on previous works done if you are submitting  
* Lie about your experience, you will be caught eventually and it will suck for you and the employer
* Take the shotgun approach; it’s not a numbers game……  
* Send out generic cover letters, the layout is the same but please edit the material and content (if I see your company, my generic application sensor starts tingling)
* Be oblivious when contacted for a phone interview, know your applications and the positions and companies you applied to  
* Send out generic resumes; tailor your resume’s layout to the job posting. Highlight the competencies the employer is looking for first – if it’s not on the first page, it will most likely not be read!
* Send out a novel of a resume. You say you have excellent written communication skills? Prove it by summarizing your experience into a cover letter and resume without compromising the integrity of the information you’re conveying

"I left my job on July 18 with no leads of any kind and no savings whatsoever. Yesterday, I got an offer at my dream job. Here's how I did it.","On June 21, I thought I had found the next step on my career path. Literally less than a month later, I quit. I was working 80+ hours a week for not enough money. It was taking a toll on my happiness and my relationship with my girlfriend. 

I didn't know what to do. I had no savings (besides part of my last paycheck and a paycheck that would be small). However, I hustled and here's how I got a job that I feel I'll love with no help from a network, friends or family. 

First off, I treated finding a job like it was a job. I'm sure you've read this before and it's not a joke. From 8 AM to 5 PM, I searched for and applied to jobs. I wrote a specific cover letter for every one of them. Whether it was the cover letters or the website's crazy antics in regards to the information I had to give, it would take around an hour to thoroughly apply for the jobs. So then, I was turning in 8 applications a day, give or take a couple. I feel that every cover letter I sent was epic. On top of this, I still treated my life the same. I woke up at 7 and cooked breakfast. I went to the gym after ""work."" I even went out with friends on the weekends. By the first weekend, I had had a few phone interviews so I felt going out would be fine as I'd hear back from someone. On top of this, I updated my resume to reflect the skillset that I had garnered or expanded upon in my last job. I also killed a lot of the white space on my resume. I don't even have a G.P.A. on it. I feel like a lot of places understand that a G.P.A. isn't really indicative of anything anymore. I had a 3.003 out of school. Not the best and definitely not the best for some careers (so keep that in mind, engineers, IT, etc.) Regardless, I revamped my resume. Reach out to someone if you're not sure. Do not be embarrassed. I would always try to hide my resume from friends or family when I could've used the help. I didn't want them to know how poorly I'd done in college.

Secondly, I found my job on my state's job board. It's a nonprofit that works to help people find jobs. I don't know if EVERY state has these nonprofits, but I just looked up a few in a few major states. Regardless, I'm sure SOME nonprofit in every state focuses on this. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Why I think this played a major role, however, is because this essentially (in North Carolina, at least) weeded out all the Vector Marketing (sorry Vector people!) and bullshit jobs. Now, if you're in IT or something like that, this may not be an issue for you. But I know plenty of people who are ""qualified"" for some jobs, will get calls back in 30 minutes of applying, and find out that it's a pyramid scheme or uncomfortably close. Regardless, I had confidence that every job that I applied to was a legitimate organization. This meant that I was spending my time wisely.

So I got a phone interview. People put so much emphasis on the actual, face-to-face interviews (and they should), but the phone interview is a very real thing now. You need to be preparing for the phone interview as you apply. If you get a call from a random number, it's probably time for a phone interview. If you're not ready, I can only imagine how hard it is to get to the actual, first interview. Regardless, I figured it was coming and knocked it out of the park. If you get a call from a random number and it's for a job you applied to, IT MAY BE A PHONE INTERVIEW! If you're not ready, tell them you're busy. Do anything that you can to hold them off. Telling them, ""Sorry, I'm headed to a three hour movie"" while you prepare for the interview is obviously reasonable considering they randomly called you. If it's not for some organizations, you probably don't want to work there anyway. 

So I got called in for a first interview. At this point, I had spent the past TWO DAYS studying the organization and practicing my answers. In these two days, I still treated finding a job like my job, but I didn't apply to any new jobs. I simply prepared for this first interview. By the time I got there, there wasn't a question they could throw at me that I didn't have the perfect answer to. I came here to r/jobs, I searched for first interviews, I searched for first interview questions to ask, etc. I studied my answers and how I would say them--at what speed, how I would use my hands, etc. I also practiced my posture so that I could have a confident posture as I interviewed. During the actual interview, I kept careful notice of things like my hand movement and posture and adjusted them accordingly. I kept good contact with all three individuals who were interviewing me. I threw a bit of my personal traits in (like my humor) and made them laugh multiple times. When I couldn't think of an answer RIGHT off the bat, I took my time. I'd sit there in silence for 10 or 15 seconds and gather my thoughts. Then, I'd knock it out of the park. Those of you who aren't necessarily personable, practice it. Practice it for the sake of the interview. I can only imagine how many people have not gotten jobs despite being very qualified for them simply because they seemed a bit stiff or awkward. 

During this first interview, you obviously want to relate every question they ask back to your previous experience or education. This may not work for computer science or engineering, but in a lot of careers, you are going to be asked the EXACT SAME QUESTIONS that you read whenever you Google what questions you may be asked. I can't quite hone in on how many questions I got, but I would say a good 25% were questions I'd heard plenty of times before and had mastered. I had mastered exactly how I would tie them back to my previous experience. 

I knew I killed the first one. I texted all of my friends and let them know that the job was mine. After my first interview, they told me that I'd hear back from them by the end of the week (my first interview was on Tuesday), and that there would only be a second interview if there was another great candidate. On Wednesday, I awaited my offer. Cocky, I know. But I flat-out murdered that first interview. Nothing on Wednesday. On Thursday, I received a call... They needed me for a second interview. Fuck. I had some real, true competition. I was one of two possible candidates. Did I fret? Did I cry and hope I'd get it? Nope. I went back to the drawing board. 

This time, I researched the second interview. I'd actually never had one despite having four jobs since 18 (I'm 24 now). I read that there was a possibility that it'd be a tour and that they'd want to see how I fit in with the organization. I read that the questions would get a little bit more in depth. So I prepared. I prepared my ass off. By the way, the second interview was at 4 PM, and they called me to ask if I could come in for another one at 12:30 PM. Maybe that's their technique... but on my end, it just seemed like a short amount of time. Regardless, I got ready as much as I could. I got more in depth with my answers, and literally practiced how I would speak to people I met to show how I'd fit in with the organization. I went deeper in my research. I went through the first 20 pages on Google to read anything I could on the organization. I could've done more, I'm sure. I knew names, dates, facts, and figures. I knew their outcomes, their budget, their programs, etc. I was ready when it came down to it. 

I went in and was as personable as I could be. They had someone new there to interview me. I had expected the CEO from my research (and prepared questions and answers for her in particular!) but it wasn't her. Regardless, I had practiced everything so many times it didn't matter. I took a tour of the facilities, asked NEW and more SPECIFIC questions to see if I wanted to work there (that's what they're looking for on a second interview, I'd read), and walked out of there feeling like I'd kill that interview too.

But tomorrow, 9 AM came. And no call. I waited and I waited. It seemed like I waited for an eternity. No call. DON'T let this psyche you out. Sometimes it takes time as I learned today. Well, I guess that's obvious. But I just always think they'll call the person who gets the job right away. Anyway, I got the call. Every time I've gotten a job, actually, the person on the other end extending the job offer to me has always sounded somber like they had some bad news for me. This was no different. But I heard the words. ""We'd like to offer..."" I literally teared up. I had no savings. I had reached out to my friends and family but to no avail. I had to continue to make money immediately. And I succeeded when I had to. It literally made me flat-out cry. 

So what did I do exactly? I listened to all of the advice I'd ever gotten. I read long ass bullshit like this. I internalized all of the advice that I'd ever read. I was confident mainly. I answered every question like I'd already had the job. r/jobs had helped me out more than they knew. They'd taught me so much about interviewing and fine-tuning a cover letter or resume. Thank you so much, r/jobs. You helped me find work that is righteous. I'm working for a nonprofit that helps at-risk women. This is an important goal to me. This was also the first job I'd ever gotten where there was solely one position. Every other job I'd ever gotten, there were multiple positions open for the same job title. This one was special. And all the research I did, including here on r/jobs helped me tremendously. 

Stay hopeful. And I hope this information helps someone as r/jobs has helped me.

Please stop the internship optimism,"After reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20rndr/my_parents_dont_seem_to_be_able_to_get_it_through/) about an intern seeking his parents' approval, I feel the need to reach out to my fellow Millennials on the issue of internships. 

Background: I'm 24. I had ***11*** internships. I have an MA and I'm at my first fulltime job. Internships suck, companies are taking advantage of people, etc etc. But we (Gen Y) need to reflect a little on ourselves. This is the kind of thing that bothers me: One girl recently told *[The Week](http://theweek.com/article/index/242065/america-is-raising-a-generation-of-interns)*,  “You either do what you like to do for free or you have an entry-level job for $25,000 where you answer the phone and are someone's assistant.” This kind of attitude is a problem. Internships largely do not lead to a job. According to *[this study](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx),* 

> 63.1 percent of paid interns received at least one job offer. In comparison, only 37 percent of unpaid interns got an offer; that’s not much better than results for those with no internship—35.2 percent received at least one job offer.

As young people, we've been raised on the idea that if we try hard enough, we can do anything. We're tumbling into an internship spiral, and we can't afford it. 

Now our parents would say that we should just create our own businesses. And once again, that's a misunderstanding of our generation. Part of the reason why we go through so many internships is because *we desperately want to be accepted into existing institutions.* We're *scared to death* of entrepreneurship.  But here's the thing: Unless you want to get underpaid for a job you're overqualified for (there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm assuming that you're taking an internship in the hope of getting something better), or want another internship, that is your option. 

</rant>"
"After 8 months of unemployment, with close to no responses from companies I've applied for, I finally got an interview for a job. One week after my interview, I receive an email saying I was the perfect candidate and that I'm hired!","I know 8 months is nothing compared to what other people have gone through. But to me it felt like forever. And the shame of it was really getting to me. Right before I got laid off from my last job, I bought a car for the first time in my life. And I was stuck with so many bills that I could barely keep up. My credit card debt has skyrocketed, my savings account diminished, and whatever money I had to help me get through it was from unemployment benefits. Being surrounded by my incredibly successful girlfriend and her family made things even more gutt-wrenching for me. I know her parents somewhat wish I were more successful and I could really feel it every time I was around them.

But now, I finally got a job again! And it's in a company that's growing everyday. It's a full time office job that's literally a few feet away from my college, so taking night classes has never been easier!

I'm so damn excited and I'm keeping it all in right now. But I just wanted to share this with you guys.

If you're unemployed right now, applying to jobs and getting no responses, building debt and stressing out every day, **DON'T GIVE UP!** Keep applying every single day, to as many jobs as you possible can. Make applying to jobs your **job**. I'm positive you'll find something. And when you do, you'll feel great about yourself!"
Straight out of college mistakes,"Any of you or your coworkers make mistakes that harmed them because they did not know how to adjust to getting a real job straight out of college? I want to hopefully help those who are clueless about how to be professional, because I have seen some new young employees totally mess us up."
Tip: Save the job ad when you apply for a position. They often get deleted after the application deadline.,I'm going to a job interview tomorrow and am currently preparing. Would have been nice if I'd been smart enough to save the text of the ad so that I had the exact description of what they're looking for...
Just landed a great sales job in NYC. Here's what I did to have a successful job hunt!,"I'd been trying to move back to NYC after having done an internship here a few years ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't get so much as a call because I was living in Ohio. Well, I sold my car, packed two suitcases and got a sublet for a couple months and, about 3 weeks later, I was employed! I'm working for a great company that should yield some fantastic income and it's something I never even knew I'd be interested in.

Enough about me. Here's what I did over the past few weeks to land a job:

RESUME:
•Personalize each resume you send with company name and position. I kept a general resume and would just change out the company name, position and any skills they mention in the description. Save each one as a PDF with your name, desired position and company and throw it in a folder on your desktop. It takes seconds but why not make sure it's not just a vague, half-assed resume?

•Make sure that there are NO spelling or grammatical errors on your resume. None. Take it to your friend with the English degree. Take it to your university's writing center. I work with several recruiters now who said they can spot a typo within 3 seconds-- and guess what happens to that resume?

•Create a section that lists skills and abilities. Why? Resume searching software pulls keywords!

•Your friend, the graphic designer? Throw him $20 and a case of beer and have them create a great layout, something you can edit. Do you know how many boring, ugly resumes come through?

•If your GPA is above a 3.0, throw it on the resume. Also, add what year and month you graduated. A recruiter mentioned that they like to see it-- and if they don't see it they sometimes view it as a red flag that you didn't graduate or are hiding something.

THE COVER LETTER

•I hated writing these. But write a few drafts. Trim them, omit things and get them down to a reasonable length. Try to throw in the keywords that you see mentioned in the description so anyone scanning your cover letter will pick them up. Keep it concise.

•I had several versions of these because I was considering different roles. I had one for sales, one for corporate advertising/marketing, one for advertising agency and one general one for anything that didn't quite fit the others. If you're applying to very different roles, just have different cover letters, drop in the company name and position and BOOM-- personalized cover letter.

•At the end, don't simply just say ""Let me know if you want to talk"". Offer a time or date when you can come in. Tell them that you'll call them this week to ensure they received the cover letter-- and then CALL THEM FOR REAL. Ask for an interview, even if it's just a phone or Skype interview. Why offer all of this info to them with no call to action?

THE HUNT

•Update your LinkedIn profile. This is now maybe just as important as showing up to an interview because it's what recruiters look at all day long (Source: I work with a team of recruiters and interviewed with another recruiting agency) Recommend people you believe in and write them reviews. Request or hope that they do the same. Join professional groups that have to do with your industry, geographic area or education. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile has your most recent resume and credentials listed! And that photo? Better be professional looking.

•I set aside times of the day to hunt. I started beating myself up after a while when I didn't get up at 7AM and work until 7PM. But what I found is that the timeframe of 1PM-8PM was my sweet spot, so that's what I did. It IS important to keep business hours though so that you can go into an interview at a moment's notice!

•Check out LinkedIn, Indeed, Craigslist and any industry-related search sites. I found Monster and Careerbuilder to be useless.

•See a job you want? Throw down a few bucks and Fed Ex your resume, cover letter and portfolio to the hiring manager. Makes a bigger impression than just another PDF file they delete from their inbox.

•Reach out to hiring managers and HR people on LinkedIn. Ask for interviews!

•Find the name and number of the person doing the hiring? Call them. Ask for interviews! (Seeing a pattern?)

•This is perhaps one of the most valuable tips: try to find a good staffing agency or recruiter that specializes in your field. Why? They're paid to place people, unlike that HR lady you keep bombarding with your resume. Do your homework, but this was incredibly important in me getting interviews, freelance work and, eventually, my job.

THE INTERVIEW:
•For the love of God, don't be late.

•You're not late? Good. What are you wearing? It should match the company culture to the best of your knowledge. Applying to an account firm? Suit up. Applying to be a graphic designer at a boutique agency? Slim chinos and a button down. When in doubt, dress up. 

•On appearance: be clean, well-groomed. Your clothes don't need to be Versace and Armani, but try to look current and put together. If you need to, go drop $50 at H&M and get something a little snazzier than the pleated pants and too-big shirt you bought at Kohls six years ago.

•Also on appearance: nonverbal communication is important. Sit upright, don't slouch. Give a firm handshake, not a dead fish. Make eye contact. Smile. Smile. Smile. (Not too much, you don't want them to think you're too weird!)

•Prepare for the interview. Before you go in, research what the company does. Bring up any (positive) headlines you've seen in the news about them. 

•When they say ""Do you have any questions?""-- ASK QUESTIONS! ""What's your favorite part about working here?"" ""What kind of additional projects could I take on?"" ""What does the perfect candidate look like?"" Whatever their answers are, relate it to you and your experience. If they say they want a proactive accountant, mention how you took it upon yourself to find some billing issue at your last job. Whatever it is, relate their answer to you. Make it so YOU are the solution.

•Create a 30/60/90 Day Plan and present it to the interviewer after you've interviewed once or twice and base it on the info you gather from the interview. Basically, you just write out what you plan to do in the first 30, 60 and 90 days if you're hired. Do you know how impressed the people interviewing me were when I did this? This alone might've gotten me the job.

•If you feel comfortable that you're probably being considered for the job, ask for it! You don't have to say ""Give me the job"", but approach it as ""I'm really excited about this position. If you could present me with an offer, I'd be thrilled to join your team!""

•I've gotten mixed reactions on this one when I mention it to others, but it's ALWAYS worked for me. At the very end of the interview, I say something to the effect of ""You know, I'm great with criticism. Is there anything about me, the interview or my experience that you have any concern over?"" Don't pry, but let them think for a moment. Maybe they'll come back and say ""You're a bit junior for this position and I don't know if you have the experience in CSS or Java that we need..."" Counter that. ""I understand your concern, but I would point out that I am currently learning CSS and Java and that I learned HTML in three days. I may not be a senior programmer, but I learn these languages quickly."" Boom. I don't like to let them walk out with a doubt in their mind about me and it's possibly the last time you'll get to fight for the position before they pass you over!

•Ask for their card. If they don't give you one, ask for the person's e-mail address at reception. Or just address a thank you card with the person's name and company as soon as you leave. Mail it immediately. Come home and write that e-mail (if you didn't send it snail mail) right away. I've been told by recruiters that this separates the ""Maybes"" from the ""Likely New Employees"".

•Consider not taking the job. I know, it's crazy-- but I turned down two really decent offers because I wasn't excited about them. Yes, I moved to NYC without a job and then turned down jobs. Crazy? Maybe. But look-- you'll be spending 40+ hours a week at this place. You are interviewing THEM in a sense, too. If you're not into it, write an e-mail after thinking on it and just say that you value their time and feel that you should no longer be considered a candidate. 

•Go on EVERY interview you're offered. You're overqualified? Go. You're underqualified? Go. You're not interested really? Go. It might seem like you're wasting the other person's time-- and perhaps you are. But it's GREAT for experience. Try out your new questions you've developed. Ask for feedback. Worst case scenario is that you walk away with a new contact, more interview experience and no anxiety next time. I walked into my current position's interview with no expectations and was thrilled when I received the offer. You never know!

ENCOURAGEMENT:
•I had a rule when I was job hunting. If I got a rejection letter or was denied a role, I did 3 positive things like apply to another job, contact a hiring manager or follow up on an application. It keeps you moving forward.

•Eat healthy. Go to the gym. Look and feel your best when you go in for the interview!


I realize this is a wall of text, but let me just put this out here: I have a liberal arts degree from a state college with a decent but not exemplary GPA. I moved to a new city without a job and took a huge risk. But what made me successful, I believe, is that I learned HOW to job hunt and gained some great skills and insight on how to do it. I made it my job to learn how and constantly improve. 

PM me if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!

Here's how to stand out from rest of job applicants and drastically increase your chances to get a job,"Start a blog!

I know that this might sound funny, but hear me out.

I started to blog a year and a half now.  Since I always wanted to work in marketing, that's what I was blogging about - marketing.

And then, in every resume and cover letter that I sent, I mentioned that I run a blog on that topic, and leave a link.

That resulted that in 5 job offerings, and they all told me they liked my blog, and that it's on of the main reasons they invited me for an interview.

Don't hesitate.  Start a blog.  There are tons of tutorials on YouTube that'll show you how to do it in less then half hour.

And then just write about your area of work and expertise.  Just show what you (can) do.  Teach people how to do something.  Something that you already know how to do.

And don't think too much about the design, and the fonts, and all other unimportant stuff.

Just teach people.  That will show your potential employer that you really understand your craft, and you'll be in much better position that the rest of candidates.

Any of you already have a blog that helped to get a job?"
PSA: References - its NOT illegal for your employer to give one (even a bad one) (USA),"Apologies if you already knew this, but it seems to be one of the most pervasive beliefs in job-hunting that employers can't say anything negative about you in a reference check (or that they are only able to give dates you were there, or confirm if you're eligible for rehire).

This. Is. Wrong.  

So many comments are giving the OPs a false sense of hope/security by assuring them that performance that lead to them getting fired (for example) won't turn up in a reference check.  Far better advice would be to help them frame a response that will help them address the situation with potential employers before it comes up.

Don't just take my word for it; here's some reference articles (by a HR Professional and an Employment lawyer) that will - hopefully - put paid to this idea that it's illegal for past employers to give a bad reference. They also give suggestions for how to try and manage bad references while job hunting. I've added one from a manager on ensuring your references are in order.

[Are your job references in order?](http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/outside-voices-careers/2013/02/13/are-your-job-references-in-order)

For those of you who see this and think ""yeah, but most reputable employers have policies against giving references"", or think that only small businesses without a cadre of lawyers and HR personnel would give references... I'm a hiring manager with one of the very largest global Fortune 20 employers, and they have no such policy. To the best of my knowledge (based on getting references from them) - neither do our biggest clients/competitors.

I am a Compensation Analyst for a company based in the U.S. that has business units and offices in 26 different countries.  I wanted to do an AMA to answer questions you might have coming from a slightly different perspective than a recruiter has.  My job focuses on salary information for positions to include researching our current salaries and comparing them to market data to ensure equity, and also in job description creation.  

I can try to help out the best I can with job questions, resumes, or other compensation related inquiries.

This could go into r/offmychest also. I started a new job last week..,"I don't know if i have the vocabulary to describe how much i'm struggling. I mean, people have said i can do it, but my boss just went through a process with me at what felt like the speed of light, and i just sort of nodded as she was explaining what she was doing, not to mention i was 'trying' to take as many notes as possible. The process of her doing it at normal speed took around 2.5 hours. This scares me. I am really upset now because it seems like i should know more than i do. I thought i was a relatively bright person, but i do not feel like that anymore. I guess i could just say to her that i sort of understood it but there are parts i don't have a clue about, but there are 6 other people in this office who have all been working here for ages. I'm the only one who hasn't been to University for this job, but she hired me knowing that, so i guess...? Rambling now. I need some advice please :("
Tips from the hiring line,"I have an open position that has been hard to fill.  Needless to say I got excited to receive 16 resumes yesterday.  They were a mix of internal and external candidates.

For all candidates I scan their resume and look at their LinkedIN profile.  Assuming I see enough of interest I take the following actions.

For internal candidates, I email their boss to confirm they are available for release as well as ask for general feedback on their performance.  Assuming I don't know the candidate I also check with any people I know in their department or shared contacts on LinkedIN.

For external candidates, if we share a contact on LinkedIN I call them.  I do refrain if the shared contact is at the same company as the candidate.

For all the candidates that pass this initial screen I send a short email.  It has the position title in the header and reads.

>Hi xxxx,
 
>I am the hiring manage for this position and would like to schedule an initial half hour phone interview with you.  Please share 4-5 30 minute time blocks that meet your schedule.
 
>Thank you,


Tip #1, even if you have carpet bombed your applications don't respond hey thats great can you send me the job description.  You have the title, and the company I work for.  I expect you to be able to put 2+2 together to know which job I'm wanting to talk to you about.

If I had tons of applicants and the positions filled quickly this is honestly enough to pass a person up for.  However since I am having trouble filling this role due to its niche nature I gave the benefit of the doubt.  I sent a meeting invite with a time and date that matched the selection provided and worked for me.  I also included the description in the meeting invite.

Tip #2, don't respond to the meeting invite with thanks, when do you want to meet.  The time and date are in the header.  Most email systems, especially gmail, not only recognize the time and date they provide a nice little button that allows you to accept or decline.

I've had two interactions with this candidate and in both cases they have either demonstrated ineptness or laziness.  Those are not good qualities and frankly I don't have the time or bandwidth to micromanage.

**Takeaway**  When applying for a job, think before you respond, verify your information, don't ask questions you already have the answer to."
"As someone tasked with setting up interviews, I have some resume advice.","ALWAYS keep it to one page. I feel like this should go without saying, but you would be shocked by what some people submit. Make sure everything is aligned, put only relevant and/or recent experience. We have people putting down positions they had for a few weeks in the 90's!

From a hiring standpoint, keep it brief. If anyone is not confident, I'd be happy to post a sample (fictional of course) or look over resume's PM'd to me.

EDIT: I'm gonna step up and apologize here. In my experience multiple pages is too much. I personally am hiring entry level, intern level, and general administrative positions. I personally don't have enough experience or knowledge to comment on upper management and science based positions."
"After 7 months of unemployment, I've finally been offered a job! Here's how I got it...","Unemployed for 7 months, applied for anything and everything I thought I was remotely qualified for. For the first few months I got absolutely no response from anyone, then I saw a career counselor who helped me do a total revamp of my resume. Since December I've gotten 7 interviews, with the one I had last week finally panning out. And what was different about it? I knew the person who interviewed me. 

I desperately wanted the ""you'll only get a job through networking"" people to be wrong. But after what just happened, I'm pretty sure they're not. I'm sorry for everyone who has to deal with this crappy economy and the ridiculous bullshit hoops companies make you jump through. I sincerely hope all of you get jobs tomorrow! And although I want to punch myself in the face when I say this, all I can tell you to do is network. The connection I had is my cousin's husband's sister. Hit up EVERYONE you know, because someone out there is bound to work for somebody that's hiring. Good luck to all of you!"
Job scam on online boards across US.,"Sitcocommunications.com has been posting job ads across the US on multiple job listing sites including job search.com and indeed.com.

"""Your job is not your job; your job is to find a better job.""","Full Quote:

> Just after college, I took my first airplane trip, destination California, in search of a job. I was seated next to a businessman who was probably in his early 60s. I suppose I looked like an odd duck with my serious demeanor, bad haircut and cheap suit, clearly out of my element. I asked what he did for a living, and he told me he was the CEO of a company that made screws. He offered me some career advice. He said that every time he got a new job, he immediately started looking for a better one. For him, job seeking was not something one did when necessary. It was a continuing process.

> This makes perfect sense if you do the math. Chances are that the best job for you won't become available at precisely the time you declare yourself ready. Your best bet, he explained, was to always be looking for a better deal. The better deal has its own schedule. I believe the way he explained it is that your job is not your job; your job is to find a better job.

Don't geographically limit yourself! It's a big world.,"I just checked out 27 years of earnings on the social security website. It's almost like a career diary. As I reviewed it I realized that as tough as relocating can be, it was a very necessary part of my career. I moved to five cities in 3 states in 27 years but I'm convinced that my income (and my job satisfaction) would probably be two thirds what it is now without having moved around the country for the right opportunities.  You may have to live where you don't want to as you are building your resume' but when you've proven yourself you can start choosing where YOU want to live. Here's my income path:

1988 $11,340 Unemployment, temp jobs, depression

1989 $23,308 Moved to city I didn't want to live in, but grateful for the opportunity.

1990 $24,670 Promotion and relocation to another city.

1991 $26,454 New city, new company.

1997 $50,603 New city, new company. 1st job as ""the boss"".

2003 $79,164 New city, new company.
 
2005 $90,000 Promotion within same company. No relocation.

Crosspost from r/GetEmployed: Confessions of a former HR Recruiter,"Having worked in Human Resources for the past couple of years, I've come to realize that a lot of the knowledge I take for granted is not exactly the kind of thing most people think of when applying. There are so many minute details that help form a recruiter's opinion of a candidate, and I thought it would be good to write about them in an easily-digestible way.

Presenting [Confessions of a former HR Recruiter: Part 1](https://medium.com/@jammyspoons/no-luck-on-the-job-front-here-s-why-bbae158752e8)!

Any questions / feedback would be highly appreciated as this is sort of a pilot project."
Resume Templates,"For extra cash, I've been redesigning CVs for some professionals and I thought of sharing the designs with Reddit.

I linked three of the designs I made below. [Preview](http://imgur.com/a/Cq7Zx)

[Template 1](http://www.filedropper.com/resumetemplate1)
[Template 2](http://www.filedropper.com/resumetemplate2)
[Template 1](http://www.filedropper.com/resumetemplate3)


First I'd like to apologize for the weird titles, companies and cities. I tried to mask the real customers as much as I can but keep the descriptions as examples. I also tried to be creative with the changes but that turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated.

As for the designs, I always try to create attractive CVs without compromising their professionalism. I admit sometimes I got carried away with them, but hopefully not too much.

I also hyperlink where I think the HR employee would copy/paste into Google. The fields usually are the name (link it to their LinkedIn), companies (to their websites), and awards (their websites). I also hide the hyperlink (the underlined blue) so to not ruin the design.

I also have a lot of tips on how to design your cv with an effective flow and what not. I've done A LOT of research when I was jobless and now I'm happy to say that I have a much higher callback rate (not solely because of the designs, but I think thy helped). I would love to share them with you if interested.

Hope you like them :)

Tell me about yourself,"Apparently the most commonly asked job interview question is:
""Tell me about yourself""

Am I supposed to tell about my education and all of my skills that I have gained over time? Aint I supposed to highlight my skills in other questions such as, ""Tell me about yours strengths"" or ""Why do you want to work for this position""?

"Just got hired to take over a Hookah Lounge, would like to see what your ideas are to help fix it!","So I just got hired and have previous Owner experience to help manage and correct a long standing Hookah lounge in town. When this place was good it was doing 200k a year and ran like a top. Now I am walking into a staff that is disappearing to other jobs, no management structure, everyone is friends with everyone and inter-dating within the business, and giving away product to regulars. The owners are dedicated to correcting everything but they and I have agreed that they can't be the managers and owners and staff and everything in between.

So guys, what ideas do you have for fixing the staff issues, setting up a structure and anything else you can think of!

"
"A Tip on being at the top. It got me my current job, and I only did it for a couple of days.","After being unemployed for about 4 months, I decided that what I was doing wasn't working. I was just applying at websites using their long Application Form. It just wasn't working well at all, because you spend about 10 minutes filling it in and they look at it for 5 seconds and click Next.

So I got this idea. I went on Gumtree (Go to your equivalent website, so like Craigslist or something), sort by your area and then click on Jobs. Put on a film, and every 2 minutes, just click Refresh. You'll see the new jobs up, which is when you apply with your usual CV and Cover Letter. I had made about 4 different cover letters depending on the job I was applying to and copy and pasted it from Notepad. That way, when you apply, you're usually the first one they see and they will click you.

In my previous job, we did recruitment via Gumtree and that's how I did it. I just looked at the first few before I realised I couldn't be bothered to look through them all and only chose the first few.

Doing this landed me my current job as a Hotel Manager, so hopefully it'll work for you!"
My online job hunting routine,"I just finished my second round of successful job hunting in the last few years and thought I would assemble what I know that might help others.  This is not THE WAY by any means, simply what worked for me.  A bit of warning up front: I use a Mac and recommend several paid applications.  I am sure there are free options or comparable Windows options but these are what I know and use.

Job hunting is not a marathon, marathons have a fixed length, this is a series of tests like the trials of Hercules and you will be frustrated until you pass them all in a row and win a job.  Or keep sucking at one part of job hunting and wait for someone with bad judgment to pass you to the next test.  The tests are as follows:

0. Have done something in your life to prepare you for the job.  I cannot help you with this.  Often an effective personal narrative is what bridges the gap between your experience and the job requirements in the minds the hiring people.  This is the ‘elevator pitch’ that is the way you tell your own story in a minute or two.  

1. Have a clear, professional, error free resume. 
There is loads of stuff out there on this.  Read some but do not believe any source 100%.  Use any university or public resource you can, have other people read your resume.  If you are willing to move but are not aiming for jobs that will pay for relocation, find an address local to the job you are applying for and use that in the application process.  This is what friends are for and no one will remember the address on your resume when you get the job. 

2. Have a decent cover letter that does not make you sound desperate, bitter, illiterate, or like a robot.
This is not the place to hit a home run.  Just do not screw it up, sound like a literate person, express interest, and do not regurgitate your resume.  The closest I get to the resume thing is a sentence that frames my experience and how I could be a good fit for the job. For example, “I believe my experience, passion, and knowledge would enable me to quickly make a valuable contribution to —- given the opportunity.”  Just looking at that sentence makes me want to throw up but I got a phone interview with that.  No one expects cover letters to be great.  No contractions, no overly personal information(I overcame a crappy mom, etc).  80% of my cover letter is the same every time but I work on a unique sentence or two for each one. 

3. Pass the google search that will happen when a human being sees your resume and wants to know more. 
Your online presence is important. 
My contact info on my resume is: myfirstname.mylastname@gmail.com.  Use something like that with a password used ONLY for this email.  I have an uncommon last name so I can have a cool email but any reference in the first two pages of google refer to me.  So…
 Google yourself.  If your tumblr where you reblog nsfw stuff pops up change your name on tumblr immediately. It is not hard to push bad stuff down the google list by changing your name on those sites or joining sites like twitter, meetup, linkedIn, google+ or the like and only doing/following things that make you look like an active interesting person engaged in your chosen profession.  These big social media sites will dominate your google search quickly.  People like hiring fun people but they get blamed for hiring unprofessional people so do not be someone who reminds them of that guy they had to fire.
Also google your name + your current town.  This is stuff managers do.  If you have something interesting to say or show don’t put it on Facebook, get squarespace and make a website.  You can also get an email address from them so make that your job-hunt email.  If all you want is a blog or portfolio the default setting look pretty good and it makes you look better than people who only exist on Facebook.  These kinds of activities are good ideas, they can actually make you a more networked, engaged person and also make the job of finding a job a bit more creative than sweating over cover letters for weeks or months on end. 

4. Sound like someone who a real person would want to hire on the phone.  
Please remember that starting now, The person you are talking to wants you to succeed.  For some this is the easy part, for others a source of terror.  I do not have a lot of advice but there is a lot of info out there about this.  
 Study the job/interviewer/company as much as possible before hand.  Ask some interesting questions.  Take notes and do not be afraid to ask the other person for a moment to write down something.  It shows a professional interest. 
Treat your body like you are about to do something athletic; eat but not just before; be hydrated, have coffee or whatever you like that is a mild stimulant, stand up and walk around while talking.  Be in the moment having a conversation with a person who wants to like you.    

5. Present in person like you were on the phone  
There is all kinds of info out there on this.  I cared too much on my first few of these and screwed it up badly.  Later, after a 10 month search I got two offers in the same week and in both my internal attitude was like [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtwXlIwozog).  On the outside I was acting the pleasant guy at the fancy party, easygoing, engaged but not expecting anything to come of it.  People feel need and it is not attractive.  
Again, everyone you meet who has a say in the matter wants you to succeed.  

6.  Miscellaneous other hoops(drug test etc).  
I have only had to do this once.  No advice really, just be ready.  People like to say yes but corporations like to say no and drugs are an easy no.  

7.  Don’t get screwed over in the process. 
Passing number eight is, frankly, optional.  
I cannot speak to your situation but I hope you do not let desperation dictate your actions. 
If you feel truly desperate you are like a drunk chick alone at a party, you might get home safe but you will be a magnet for predators.  Sooner or later bad things will happen.    
Another way to get screwed is ID theft.  If you are putting your personal info on dozens of websites and using the same password on all of them then God help you.  If you are using the same password for the email you are giving these websites and have anything involving money going to that email you are beyond God’s help.  
1Password is a great tool that will save your bacon in this.  It remembers passwords, It generates strong passwords, it autofills online resumes.  You use condoms right?  This is a condom for the internet.  You are sticking your very personal info in all kinds of strange places in a job hunt and you need protection.  I Use a password manager to make a very strong password for my job-hunt email.  I do the same for any password on any company or job hunting site I use.  That way every password I put out there is unique and will not compromise my email.  
      
A few other things I do during all this…
I use Scrivener to collect everything I know about a company/job/process.  I print webpages, job ads, and emails to pdfs and store them together so if the website changes or the job ad goes away I have it.  I also put any notes from interviews there.  I date everything in there using textExpander so when a company I forgot about calls me back 3 months later I know what I told them and what they told me.  This is also my todo list as I know which ones I applied to and which ones I forgot about.  There are some cheaper alternatives to this like nvAlt, evernote, or even a job-hunt folder.  This also helps me keep all my cover letters so when I get stuck I can go back and borrow a sentence or two. 
The night before a physical interview I look at it all and note anything interesting.  People are impressed if you notice the job add changed from a month ago.  
TextExpander is a great tool that lets you make abbreviations for common bits of text.  For instance, when I type ddate into a text field it turns into September 2, 2013(for example).  You can whip out a good cover letter by making 5-10 good sentences into their own TextExpander snippets and arrange them in the order you like.  For instance, I might set the abbreviation pplease to expand into “Please consider the enclosed resume for the position of — as advertised on the — website.”  A few more of those, a real sentence or two thrown in and you have a nice, non-crazy cover letter.  This is not needed, but it is what I do.  I also use textExpander to date the files in my Scrivener project.  These are the tricks that make me not look absent minded.  
A big piece of all this is to not present as a bitter desperate person.  The only way I know to do this is to not be bitter or desperate.  Again this is what worked for me.  I focus for 1-3 hours a day on job-hunt work, more if I feel like it, but then care for myself in whatever way I can for the rest of the day.  I think of it as maintaining the machine that will one day be ready to pass a personal interview, the version of me that other people want to be around.  I walk the dogs, play games, exercise, read, etc.  A lot of people, myself included, can spiral into themselves and stew in their own sense of failure.  Think Gollum.  Would Gollum pass a phone interview with the ring bearer?  Not likely.  Not becoming bitter or desperate is the hardest part for me, maybe for most.  It gets better.  We live in screwed up times and you are not alone in this.  

Tldr. Job hunting is not a marathon, marathons have a fixed length. This is a series of tests and you will be frustrated until you pass them all in a row and win a job.  I do not expect anyone to do everything I do. I have a good system that works for me and offer any bit of it that helps.  "
PSA: applying for jobs online? Don't forget craigslist.,"I know some people shy away from craigslist, and there is a lot of junk on there. But, I've gotten more interviews through craigslist than indeed or any other site. PLUS, it's usually as easy as submitting a resume and cover letter versus filling out a bunch of stuff.

"LPT: when writing a resume... focus on the job you want, not the jobs you've had","Having a ""work history"" section is a must, but when it comes time to rewrite your resume, make sure it's slanted toward getting the job you want, not focusing too much on the jobs you've had. 

This is especially true if you've switched careers: focus on your expertise with the new industry rather than using valuable space for a job no longer relevant. The way [resumes are written](https://www.vmsolu.com/resume-writing-resolutions-for-job-seekers-in-2015/) has changed a lot in recent years, and this is just one of the things potential employers have come to expect."
"I have been offered a position that would be the equivical to the US Presidents ""body man."" How do I figure out what my on-call downtime and travel time is worth.

* Available at employers whim. I will need to make my schedule his schedule, even when they do personal errands and somedays being available without much if any notice. Basically I will give up my life for a year to a year and a half because of this position. He can't afford to give up a year while he develops more business opportunities in his family's company and deals with some big franchises that have approached and what his family currently has going on, which is substantial.
* There will be a lot of downtime while I travel for days with them.
* I am being paid to be available, discrete, professional and reliable. I will also use my degree, industry knowledge, life experience and sound advice. He knows I can do it because I recently worked for his family in a much different capacity but as he said, they were very impressed how I demonstrated these things. He would use me as a personal assistant for those skills. But the most important duty is to be able to drive him where he needs to go, which is almost daily for work in a large region. I would learn a lot on how his organization operates but after a year to a year and a half there is no guarentee of a position or expectation of a position with this organization.
*  He has offered a salary but it doesn't seem to cover all the on-call time or the 3 or 4 days I will need to travel with him out of town. 
*  I will be paid by him and not his family's organization right now becaise he is trying to keep his circumstances quiet to others in his organization.  At certain times when he meets with people I will need to stay out of site or in the deep background because of what their perceptions of this situation might be.
* I will be given a housing allowance that would pay for a place I could live or about 60 to 70 percent of a great place to live. I am having to move an hour away to where he lives. And despite the move, the move isn't an inconvenience.
* I will have very few expenses when in his company. And because his family owns two different restaurant groups, I could eat for free all throughout this region even when I'm not in his company. Basically a credit card to use at those 16 locations. Not bad food but I wouldn't eat there all the time because I like to go out and eat and cook as well.
* I will probably save about half of what I make when this if through, and that would include being debt free except a student loan but aggressively paying it off. But I am worried I will get extremely bored quickly and in a year be out of a job and have another year short of starting a career.
* How do I figure out what my time is worth beyond 40 hours and although there is downtime, I'm still on call. What is that time worth?
"
Where are the Jobs at?,"OK guy's here is the deal.  I have been laid off for a month and a half now and that went by quick as hell.  I have been applying for at least 10 jobs a day.  I was with a company for 8 years and worked my way up the chain and was making a decent 40K a year.  They laid me off out of nowhere and I am lost.  In those 10 jobs a day (which equates to about 500 jobs at this point) I have had 1 interview.  That's right 1.  Of course I didn't get the job.  I have no trade skills and I have 2 semesters until I finish my associates degree.  The only thing I am qualified for is minimum wage retail jobs or slightly above minimum wage security jobs.  I feel like a loser.  My question is this.  I am a single guy in his 30's and have nothing tying me down.  I live in Colorado and can not get a job to save my life.  If I wait out my unemployment benefits (4 1/2 months to go) I might be homeless.  I have no one to go to so this sucks.  I am willing to sell all my stuff and start fresh somewhere.  So where should I look?  Where are there the most job openings that pay decent.  I mean at least $12 or $13 an hour.  I mean, that's not to much to ask is it.  Should I look to the East Coast or the West?  I would seriously go anywhere until I can hammer out school. I want to leave while I still have income from unemployment.  You know, before I become completely homeless and lost.   Any advice would be great.

As we were talking, he said, “I am doing my job well.  I deserve this promotion and they are looking for excuses not to give it to me.”

Have you ever felt that way?  Do you feel that way right now?

If the answer is yes, stop and ask yourself a few questions:

*Why do I deserve this promotion?

*What tangible evidence is there to support that I am capable of doing the job (not your current job, but the “next” job)?

*Do my skills, experiences and results meet those basic expectations of the job description of the role I would be promoted to?

What I find is that most people, when they try to answer those questions, will come back to the fact that they do their current job very well, but they don’t have the skills or experiences for the role they want be promoted to.

Take yourself, and the promotion or job you want, out of the equation.  Put yourself in the position of the hiring manager.  You have probably been a “hiring manager” at some point in your life.  Let’s say you had some car trouble that you couldn’t fix yourself.  Would you hire someone who worked exclusively on motorcycles to fix your car?  Probably not.  For the same cost, you are probably going to go with the person who has the experience solving this particular problem for your particular make and model of car, right?  Well, that’s how managers look at promotions – they want to feel confident that you have achieved success in a particular area before they put you into a role.

So let’s delve into why this perspective does not come naturally to us.  Remember, back in school, how you had a class with identified learning objectives?  You learned those objectives and you got to move on to the next class in that series, which built on the previous class’ learning.  The only prerequisite for the next class was the previous class.

Now when we transitioned from school into the workplace, our classes became roles or jobs.  And the pre-requisite for next job or role, comes with qualifications beyond just having done the current job well.  This creates a gap, that up until this point, we have never faced.

*Now suddenly, we have to do our roles well and take on new skills and experiences on our own in order to progress to the next level. *

After 20-some years of this pattern of advancement, you begin to expect that advancement always works the way that it did in school.  Consequently, you take the same steps that have gotten you the results you want your entire life – following the course outline (or job description, as it were) and waiting for your teacher (or boss) to tell you that you are ready for the next class (or a promotion).  Sometimes the waiting game works, which reinforces it’s the only way to go.  When it doesn’t work the way you expect, it can create a sense of confusion, frustration and a sense of being stuck.

Now what are the people who are getting the promotions doing differently?  Well those people aren’t being limited by the belief that they need to have a job before they can begin to get the necessary experience for the job.  So they seek out professional development and learning opportunities at work (special projects) or on their own (classes). I find this is particularly common with athletes and advanced placement students.  For athletes, there are never lines in the sand for performance – they are always striving for a higher and better performance than the last time.  So a job description isn’t limiting, they are playing a game against themselves to be better and to do more.  For the advanced placement students, they got used to being pushed outside of the current curriculum by themselves, their parents and teachers.  Consequently those individuals are less likely to feel bound by the confines of a job description, they gain the qualifications for the next role and then get promoted to the next level.

So what’s the gap you are facing between where you are right now and the promotion or job that you want?  What can you do fill that gap?  And most importantly,

    *what ARE you going to do to fill that gap?* 

Did you know that writing down your goal and telling others about it makes you 30% more likely to achieve it?  C’mon!  Tell us what you’re going to do!

"Recruiter for a Fortune 500 in NYC. Question, what do you use find & apply to IT jobs?","I'm a recruiter for a multibillion dollar company (no I can't divulge the name) headquartered in Midtown Manhattan. So I'm curious what's trending for my IT friends looking for jobs. 

I'm sure I'll get the usual suspects like LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, etc., but let me know. Thanks"
How I received multiple offers in a couple of months,"1) Find a job that you like. I find that LinkedIn is the best, Monster and other sites work well too.

2) Find many jobs. Even if you are skeptical you might turn out to like the company or the people. Also it's better to mess-up an interview at a company you don't like than your dream job. Interviewing is a skill like anything else it gets better with practice. Nothing is better practice than getting out and doing it.

3) Find the right person. If you can on LinkedIn find out who posted the job and contact them directly. Always ask for advice. I would put the subject line as ""Advice for someone interested in working at Company name"". Then I would ask for advice. It would really help me stand out from the crowd of people who just hit apply now.

4) Follow up. Many people are busy, don't hesitate to follow up a couple of times.

5) Write thank you cards. They're a small touch but help you stand out.

6) Be prepared. Know about the company and people that you're interviewing you.

7) Keep track of everything. I like Evernote and would have a note on each company. What I did to contact them, when I followed up, who I spoke to, what my next step was. I also set a quota of finding 10 jobs a day to apply to.

Brief reflections on interviewing 50 candidates for a 100k/year sales job,"* Ten minutes early is the ideal arrival timeframe. When you arrive 20-30 minutes prematurely you're actually throwing off my day. Be it cutting my lunch short, or preventing me from using allotted time to handle other tasks. I suppose I could leave you up front until our actual interview time, but I don't want to be a dick.


* I disqualified an otherwise decent applicant because his nails were femininely long for a male. I've got to draw a LOT of conclusions from preciously little information, and this was one of them.

* If I ask what your current income is, don't avoid the question or speak in general terms. An applicant yesterday avoided the question up front, and then my partner asked it again more specifically, and he still avoided it. If you want to work for me, I need to know what you're coming from.


* If I can detect that you're lying about your previous income, and frequently I can, I will assume you inflated it by roughly 10%.

* Appear as though you want the job, even if you don't. You can always decline my offer. But I will not make an offer to somebody who isn't showing some degree of zeal. A fantastic applicant from four weeks ago just called back to ask about the job (which has been filled). I would have brought him on to phase two if he had just acted more interested up front!

* I get a handle on your zeal two ways: The questions you ask me about the job, and the way you close the interview. I absolutely love when somebody wraps up by saying ""Do you have any concerns about me that I haven't addressed?"" and ""What is the next step?"".


* The guy who just walked out remembered the receptionist's name and said goodbye. It's the little things...


* Be prepared to talk about what you do at home and hobbies. Some applicants have given weak or evasive answers that make me feel they're probably boring people.


* Turned down a guy who works in my tiny niche industry because his tie was loose and the top button wasn't done. I was on the edge, but he seemed a little unmotivated to me and that button made the difference. Again, drawing a lot of conclusions from limited evidence.


* Have solid, concise, honest answers for why you left a previous job. If you talk too much, I'll find similarities between my job and the job you left, and I will hit you with difficult questions.


* My first question is always the same: *You've told me about where you work today, and how successful you are in that position, why on earth would you want to leave?*

"Quit job with no backup plan, landed job in less than 3 months - Here's what worked for me","(throwaway because there might be identifying stuff on my other account)

I'm a writer in my mid-20s who got involved with a content mill. I've only been out of college for a couple years and this was my first grown-up job. It turned out to be a really toxic environment.

I burnt out in less than a year. I made a big decision to take a leap of faith and quit with nothing lined up, because I knew I didn't have the time or energy at that job to look for new work. I had about 6 months of money saved.

That was only 2.5 months ago. I just got a new professional, full-time job in my field that I actually wanted, with a salary and benefits I'm THRILLED about. 

I know part of the equation is luck, but I wanted to share some thoughts on what I think helped the process be (relatively) quick and easy. Hopefully it will help some of you.

- I DIDN'T apply to every job listing I saw in my field. **Over 2.5 months, I applied to maybe 30 jobs at the most, probably fewer**. Most people go for quantity of applications, but I focused on finding listings that I *really* thought fit my skills and experience and that I had a good chance at. 

- **Every single cover letter I sent was customized**. I started from scratch with each one. Previously, I had used a cover letter that was a form letter, more or less, just inserting the company's name and the position title where appropriate. This method is one reason I didn't send a lot of applications: each one took me a fair amount of time to put together. I would write them with the job description at my side so that I could hit the different points in the ad.

- I do have a relatively strong resume (internship experience, freelancing experience, brief stint in marketing aka the content mill), but **I emphasized qualities that you don't necessarily get from jobs or education**. I focused on the fact that I am a reliable and organized person with strong communication skills, and this was what seemed to resonate with most of the people that called me back, not that fact that I worked at such-and-such place.

- Cover letters had very little to do with my resume. The only references to my resume were contextual - more like, ""I happened to be here when I showed this quality off especially well.""

- In the case of the job I got, **I wrote the reasons I wanted to work at the particular job** (it's an area of interest, I admire [specific thing they do], etc.). Manager seemed impressed and brought it up at the interview.

- **I woke up at 8 every day, but I didn't always work an 8-hour day**. Some days I did job search stuff all day, but others I didn't because there just weren't enough positions I found that I wanted to apply to.  On those days, I worked on freelancing or sending emails to people I'd be interested in working with someday. I went to coffee with mentors, visited friends, worked on getting my life back (I had been really depressed working at the other job). Sometimes I watched puppy videos, because sometimes you just need to veg.

- During the interview at my new job especially, I made a point of making eye contact, smiling and being relaxed. I laughed. I made a couple jokes. I wanted to be at my most personable and make a connection.

- **When addressing why I quit a job after less than a year with no backup** I didn't give any real details. You don't have to, and I clearly blew one interview earlier in this stint of unemployment by letting myself talk too much (it was a PR job and I accidentally, in my rambling, said something about wanting to get away from marketing. The fields are similar. Whoops). I said I wanted to move on to pursue new opportunities, such as something in [area of media this job is in].

- I made sure to give all my references a heads-up, and to choose them carefully. After I was hired, the director told me she was ""floored"" by the references I received. **Make connections with people who will really go to bat for you, and then stay in touch with those people**. I'm sending them all ""thank you"" cards.

NETWORK NETWORK NETWORK. **If I hadn't stayed in touch and on good terms with my references, I might not have this job. I really felt like the references clinched it for me**. Get coffee with your old professors. Have lunch with your boss. Message your former classmates on Facebook who are in your field and check up on them. People will help you if you reach out.

----

I know this was long, and some of it might seem a bit obvious, but it wasn't all obvious to me the first times I applied for jobs. I was really scared that quitting my other job would doom me to a very lengthy job search, but I ended up feeling completely refreshed and finding a job I actually want to do. I also believe that in my mental state while working at the content mill, I wouldn't have given a very strong interview or had time to write more tailored cover letters.

I hope everyone's job search goes well and that maybe this post will help someone just a little.

For the record, I know quitting a job with no fallback plan is not for everyone and isn't technically a wise decision, but it ended up being the best thing for me in my case. 

* I mainly searched Craigslist and Indeed, btw. *"
One half of my mind wants to give up on trying to find work the other half doesn't....,"It's honestly effecting me emotionally and I know there's other people out there that are struggling to. It's honestly making life not worth living for, that's how bad I'm getting. I don't know what to do, I've already applied for 7 places, been rejected, done work experience at one place which was 2 months ago....

I just don't fucking know anymore.... i'm getting frustrated to the point where I'm actually punching holes in my bedroom door. I'm trying to control my anger and frustration but shit is it hard. 

I'm pretty much fucked right now. No one will hire me and I'm starting to give up on it all. I've got my l's at the moment and doing driving lessons. I just can't see my self ever getting work."
Looking for advice on current job.,"*(Throwaway due to coworkers knowing my main account)*

Without going in great detail, I'm seeking advice on my current job situation.

Currently, I work what one might consider a first ""real"" job out of college. But, it's nothing that truly holds true to my degree. Yes, it somewhat similar, but it's not what I'd consider something I went to college for. Without typing out long and endless paragraphs, I figure I'd just give bullet-points on what facts I've gathered myself and ask some question(s) after:

* I've been with the company around three months now. I'm mostly trained up, and can do most of the work without help. *I plan on sticking with the company for around 6 months currently, or until summer.*

* I get paid around 12.00 an hour, 40 hours a week. No overtime. Boss said it's around 26,000 a year, without taxes taken out.

* From my point of view, my hours are horrible. I work times between 12-1:00am in eight hour shifts, one hour break, with a bit of a commute (20-mins) each day. This includes every weekend and every holiday. (I cannot take off any holiday) I have zero social life at the moment due to everyone else having ""normal"" day jobs.

* This current company has VERY high turnover in my position, and there is no room for advancement, and no chance of a raise.

* This current job is both high and low stress, often going from 0 to 100 in about thirty seconds sometimes. But my coworkers are nice enough to help manage that stress.

* What I currently do is not what I want to do with the rest of my life. But it's the first thing that came along that I could take with having to support myself after college. I'm learning some very good skills, but only a select few apply to what I want to be doing later in life.

So, I have some question(s) that I would perhaps like some answers or advice on:

1 - Do you think leaving after six months is a good idea based upon what I stated above? (Of course, this is a relative term, I plan on having a new job lined up before I resign) This is currently my plan.

2 - How would I address this six-month job on my resume, if I *need* to place it on there due to it looking very nice.

Having trouble finding a job? Teach English abroad!,"I left a comment on here the other day about teaching English in Asia,  and got a ton of messages about it.   

Just wanted to let you know that if you're not able to find a job where you are,  teaching English abroad is a good opportunity to make an easy living,  and possibly pay off some debt. 

I'm currently living in Korea,  and there are plenty of jobs here.   You just need to be a native English speakers,  with a university degree,  physically healthy,  and able to commit to a year abroad.   

China and other countries have lower standards,  but you don't make as much.   

I'm happy to answer any questions you may have!

After two months I landed my dream job - advice and thoughts,"Hello,

I'm a recent graduate from a top university in the UK. For years I have wanted to break into investment banking on the markets side of things (sales/trading) but without any direct past finance experience it was an uphill battle.

I've sent hundreds of linkedin messages, written over 80 specific cover letters and revised my CV countless times. I recently just passed the first and second final round interviews and was offered a position on a 2015 graduate scheme in markets.

This sub has been helpful to me and I hope others can benefit from my experiences. Note that this is probably most apt for people looking at landing their first graduate job.

**Get Passionate**
- Whilst passion doesn't come across easily on paper, particularly when applying for conservative fields, it stands out at interview. I am passionate about the bank I am joining and the direction of its markets business - I made sure that this genuine enthusiasm and energy came across face to face.

**Network**
- The benefits of networking need not be stated but honestly this helped me so much. I found it was less about the ability of your network to refer you to HR or offer you a job, but the insight they provided in the industry and advice such as how to approach interviews and what to read.

Furthermore in your professional career networking is not an additional task - it is fundamental to every business relationship. It's about developing rapport, knowledge, lingo, confidence and more.

**Knowledge**
- So I didn't have any prior financial work experience/internships whereas some of the other applicants had numerous finance internships. Knowing this limitation I made sure to work harder when it came to my own reading. I studied technical textbooks for days on end so that my knowledge would be at least equal, if not greater than, the other more experienced applicants. In my final interview I was sat across a technical chap who outright stated that the technical book I cited as reading was ""his favorite book"".

**Leverage**
- I leveraged my previous experience in a non-related field to demonstrate the qualities required for the role. You have to know what the role demands and then understand how you fit in. Don't be afraid to bring up non-related experience, just frame it correctly and confidently. If anything I used this as my point of difference, arguing the unique perspective I could bring.

**Refine** 
- When I first started writing applications I thought I had a killer template. By the end of writing applications I cringed when reading my first drafts. There's always so much room for improvement. If I were to do it again I would have spent longer on refining my early applications instead of a trial-by-fire approach.

**Competency Questions**
- So yeah, they are awful. Truth is though they are a sort of shit-test so you can demonstrate the effort you are willing to put in to get the job. In almost all careers you're going to have to do things you might not want to do, by answering competencies well you can tick this box.    

I'd like to note in my final round interview I was asked a few ""standard"" competency questions, I felt I developed really good rapport with the interviewers and went slightly off script. I told them an answer which sort-of, but not wholly, fit the criteria they asked. I then directly told them ""I know that doesn't perfectly answer your question, but I think that this question is really about my ability to X, in that case I have proven that by doing Y & Z.""

**Final Thoughts**
- I was frequently told by both family and strangers that ""something would come through"" and whilst I'm not usually one for banal platitudes there is an element of truth. It is possible that after all my hard work I could still have fallen short and not been successful, in that case I'd have widened my net and gone to plan B. However the important thing is to truly commit to your efforts, don't short change yourself and slack, if you can go the extra mile in technical reading/networking then do it - even if it's not successful it's giving you skills, determination and strength of character which will help you in the future.

Wishing you all the very best.

Looking for Tips on surviving the 2nd shift with weekends.,"As the title says, I'm currently seeking advice on how to survive my 2nd shift job that includes weekends. My shifts range from the times of 12-1:00 a.m. for eight to nine hours each day, and like I mentioned, weekends as well. 

While, in a post I put up before, I don't plan on sticking with the job for a *great* amount of time. (This is is due to a number of reasons, feel free to ask for details). I'm currently having a tiny bit of trouble keeping myself ""pepped up"" for going into work...

It's starting to become a struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance that doesn't keep my inside playing video games because everyone else is at work or asleep. When I am off on my so-called ""weekends"" at the start of the week they are unable to join me due to their work and own life. I *want* to go out and enjoy time with my friends and family, but I'm unable to. Believe it or not, it's starting to get to the point that my friends and family, for lack of a better way to put it, ""forget"" about me since I'm unable to interact with them. My phone has begun to go silent even though I'm putting in an effort to stay connected with everyone. 

Thus, I'm looking for tips or stories about people who have dealt with the same sort of thing. Any response is welcome and any story is also welcome in that same respect! 

*Feel free to ask for more details if you need to*"
Is it reasonable for a company to force you to find a replacement for you when you use PTO?,"I work as front desk for an apartment place, and work Wed-Sunday, 3-12, so finding people to work those shifts on the weekend can be difficult, and feel my boss should not make me have to find someone to cover my own PTO."
Got a dream job with an unconventional (I think) strategy. Advice inside,"This may not work for everyone, but it sure worked for me. 

I wanted to write for a living, and I couldn't find a job out of college, so I just started my own business. I created a website and worked freelance for really, really cheap. I never made much doing it, but I slowly built up a reputation for being professional and timely (and affordable). When I went to apply to the job at the big agency I've had my eye on, I had a year experience doing this kind of writing and a long list of references from a variety of businesses. 

The key to the success was that the business wasn't just me. I also brought on friends who were in similar boats but different fields (developer and graphic designer) so we were able to offer a variety of solutions for cheap money and handle nearly any project collectively. 

Sure, it was a lot of work and I did it nights while working jobs I didn't love during the day, but now I have my dream job, so I have no complaints at all. Just something to think about for those of you who are unemployed and looking all over, but of course it won't work for every field.

"If you get a better offer soon after being hired, I don't think you should quit (Despite popular advice here)","The question comes up a lot here:

*I got hired and worked with with company A for two weeks.  Now my dream job at company B just made me an offer.  Should I quit?*

And the answer in this subreddit seems to always be the same:

*Yes.  The company doesn't really care about you, and if it wasn't working out for the company, they wouldn't hesitate to fire you.*

I've come to disagree with this advice. First, I don't really think this line of reasoning is entirely true.  Yes, this is true for some companies, but in my experience, it doesn't happen very often.  Usually, employers fire new hires with a reasonable cause.  If a perfect candidate suddenly sends her resume a few weeks after a position is filled, a manager normally wouldn't fire the new hire to bring in the perfect candidate.

Second, it harms your reputation.  You're essentially burning a bridge with the company and all coworkers you have burdened.  Even if you put in notice, you will still put a lot of burden on the company.  I believe this is a huge risk for an unknown job.

Of course, there are some good exceptions to quitting so soon:

* You're working at Walmart as a greeter and you just got an offer from Google as Lead Engineer.
* You discovered that the work environment is somehow intolerable, and you don't mind burning this bridge.
* It's a truly rare opportunity like a political appointment or a lead role in a James Cameron movie."
Learning the hard way: make my resume CLEAR,"I just want to share my story and help others to prevent them making the same mistakes as I did. 

Few weeks ago, I got called in for an interview (through networking), it was a very well paid job. Coming from an hourly-base, minimum wage job, it was like a dream job for me. After 1.5 hour of conversing and talking about myself, we finally part ways. Right before we did, he mentioned ""Out of our 16 candidates, I haven't seen anyone with your qualities; you did very well in the interview today, and I am going to have my recruiters reach out to you ASAP. 

Fast-forward, 23 hours later, he personally called me. He sounded pissed. He questioned about my resume, why did I put X, Y, & Z (I don't know why he didn't see this before), and it was a bit misleading. I spent 30 minutes explaining myself, and also I made a simple mistake on my application. Now I think he is questioning about my performance. 

Good luck with job searching out there!

TL;DR: Didn't get the job because my resume was unclear.

How I Save Gobs of Tedium Filling out Application after Application,"I know budgets are tight, but if you are filling out tons of job applications, you can do yourself a huge favor by investing in text completion software. 

This is software that is constantly running on your desktop/laptop computer (ie Windows and Mac) and transforms bits of text (""snippets"") into words, phrases, or sentences. (For example, ""vi"" is transformed into ""Vandelay Industries"" once tab or space is pressed.) 

In my case, I use TypeIt4Me ($5) for Mac. If you're on Windows and are willing to learn a new syntax, AutoHotKey is a free and highly flexible option. (I actually came to like the latter very much once I learned it's archaic ways.) 

Anyways, for each job I've had in the past, I have created a standard set of snippets. 

* First, I create a unique snippet to expand into the company name. (i.e. ""vi"" from above). 

* Next, I create snippets for that company's address and for other commonly requested data. To make things easy, I begin each snippet with the letters that comprise the company snippet. (e.g. ""vipos"" for the position I held at Vandelay Industries and ""vides"" for a description of my job duties.) 

So, for an example, here's the template I use:

>vi - Vandelay Industries

>vist - 555 Broadway Boulevard

>vicity - New York, New York

>viz - 00000

>vipar - (555) 555-5555

>vidash - 555-555-5555

>vipos - Vice President, Sales (Latex)

>vides - Sold latex to importers across the U.S. Goes on for several sentences and can even include multiple paragraphs. 

>vipay - $50,000

>visup - Bob Henseley

There. Once you set this up, you can use it on tons of online applications that require you to describe each job you've been in, one-by-one. And because you use standard syntax (e.g. ""…st"" always yields a street address), you can mindlessly enter in this info and avoid errors.

I got hired! Plus- my tips on filling out a memorable (min. wage job/retail) application!,"I was underemployed, working part-time retail at a clothing store at the mall.  I've been looking for a second job for months, and finally got hired!  I am now also a cake decorator at a local grocery store.  I had work experience working in a bakery but no cake decorating experience but applied anyway even though they were asking specifically for ""experienced cake decorators.""  I'm very excited!  Today I finished day two of training.

It's rough looking for minimum wage jobs.  It takes a lot of time.  It's a pain in the ass!  

**Here are some tips I have and things I've done that have helped me get (retail) jobs:**

* Keep applying!  Don't bank on one job.  Put in as many applications as you can.  

* Make a professional looking resume, and staple it on top of your application.  You can even make a cover letter, too if you'd like, but I never did.  (In some cases, I guess a cover letter might be over-kill for this type of job, but I don't know.)

**When you're ready to turn in your application:**

* Go to the store in person dressed very professionally.

* Smile and be nice to everyone you see.  Try to be confident.

* Ask for the manager.

* Shake his/her hand and introduce yourself.  Give him/her your resume + application.  ""Hello; how are you.  I'm so-and-so, I'm a student here/new in town.  I'm applying for the [whatever] position.""  Smile your face off (but not in a [scary way](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mag4auYoHa1qcja3b.jpg)).  
EDIT: If you're not applying for a specific position but are willing to do whatever job they give you, that can be a strength.  (Some people thinks it's a weakness because it makes you seem direction-less, but it's only a weakness if you let it be.  Realize that if you're open to any position, it can help the company out.  I mentioned that I'm willing to work in different departments, so if a cashier calls out, they can call me in to cover for them, which will help your employer out a lot.)  


**On the application:**

* Write as neatly as possible.  Seriously, take your time.  I have good hand-writing, but I really slow myself down on the applications to make sure everything's clearly legible and spelled correctly.  Use white-out if necessary.

* Of course, fill it out as completely as possible.  

* Sometimes the applications will have optional questions like ""What other skills or technical training do you have that could be relevant to this job?""  DON'T BE AFRAID TO BE CHEESY!  I don't have technical training, but on my application, I wrote ""Teamwork!""  It's cheesy, sure, but it's also true- in my past jobs I've had to work on teams, and I'm good at it.  You could also write hard-working, fast learner, determined, ambitious, or something along those lines.  If you fill out more info than necessary on the application, it shows that you really do want the job and are willing to put time and thought into your app.

* Also, on some apps, there will be a space with a question like ""Why do you want this job?"" or ""Why do you think you'd be good for this position?"" or ""Why should we hire you?"" or something like that.  Tell them!  They want to know that you want the job for more reasons than just ""I need money.""  If you like the products they sell or the atmosphere of the store, tell them that's a reason.  If you could be passionate about the position, tell them!  On my cake decorator application, I knew I was lacking the experience they wanted so in this section, I wrote a short paragraph something along the lines of: ""I loved my time working at [competitor] in the Bakery.  I liked the work, and it's given me relevant experience.  I wasn't a cake decorator; however, I had some experience baking/icing cupcakes/writing on cakes/blahblah, and I really want to be a cake decorator.  I may need some training, but I'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  I'm reliable, and always show up on time.  Thank you for this opportunity, and I look forward to hearing from you.""  <- I think that answer is what got me the job.  When I came in for my interview, it wasn't really an interview.  We chatted casually for a bit, talked about what I'd done before in the bakery, and then she showed me the area, introduced me around, had me ice a cake, and then gave me my uniform!!  

* Be genuine.  Don't take my advice and say you're great at teamwork if you go into the interview and can't back up that claim with a story about how you once had to be a team player in some work scenario.  Just be honest, be yourself, and be willing to try new things.  

Well, I think that's about it.  I hope some of these tips help any of you looking for retail jobs.  These are tips I've acquired within the past two-to-three years of looking for work and working.  :)"
Advice on Job Offers (x-post from r/Biology),"Hello! I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me advice on two job offers that were offered to me. First, I'd just like to give a little bit more info about myself.


I am a recent graduate as a biology student (B.S.). I have no previous lab or work experience since I focused majority of my time in school, so I am VERY excited and grateful to have any job offers at all. In the future, I hope to transition into more computer science / software engineering, or maybe even something like bioinformatics. Since I am thinking of going that route, I am also thinking about going back to school to either get a M.S. or another B.S. in CS or SE if I have to. But this is way in the future once I have enough money saved up!


So here are the two offers that were given to me as I looked for a job:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 1**: Lab Assistant (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* $13.27/hr  – No clocking in or out, so it’s kind of like salary.
               -Flexible hours for when to start/leave, and flexible lunch break.
* Accrue PTO hours – 5 hours per paycheck (Every 2 weeks).
* HMO, vision, and dental. 
* 401K available, but no matching.


--Pros: 
* Flexible hours are nice. As long as I work about 40 hrs a week, no one seems to mind what my hours are.
* Not as strict with regards to workplace as long as I finish my work since I would be working with the rest of the lab techs only.
* I am fairly familiar and comfortable with the duties assigned to me.
* I can get great references for future jobs or for grad school (well-known as well as new Ph.Ds). 

-Cons: Quality Assurance for pharmaceutical (8 hrs, 0.5 hr for lunch)
* No overtime. And based on what other workers I have spoken to said, I will usually end up staying longer than 8 hrs per day (~8.5 hrs, sometimes maybe even 9).
* Less money
* Further from my apartment, (~30 minute drive).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Offer 2:** Quality Assurance in Pharmaceutical
* $14/hr for the 1st year as a start, annual performance review. 
* 1 wk vacation for first three years, 2 wks after three years, 3 wks after five years.
                -3 sick days per year.
* HMO, vision, and dental included after 30 days.
* 401K after 90 days +$250 annually for contributing to 401K.

--Pros:
* More money is always nice. With this, I make almost an extra $100+ a month, and almost $1000+ more annually.
* Overtime (1.5 hrs) for whenever I work after given hours.
* Closer to my apartment (>10 minutes away using side streets).
* Less wet-lab work.

Cons: 
* Most of the tasks that will be assigned to me are things I know little to nothing about.
* Stricter start/end and lunch times since I have to clock in and out. 
* I don't know if references for this job will be as useful as the other in the future. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So my questions are: 
1. Which job offer would be better to take?
2. Which job offer will be more beneficial financially?
3. Which job offer will be more beneficial in the future career-wise, or would help me reach my future goals better?

Thank you in advance to anyone that helps!

Advice: Make a new email for your job search,"Registering job search sites for daily job email alerts seemed like a great idea, all until I started getting 30 spam messages a day. An email I had for years is now flooded with spam and phishing emails. Luckily, they all filter to a spam folder, but it's still awful that these job searching sites take advantage of vulnerable people."
"[Advice] ""Your 140 Character Pitch""","So I've been applying for a lot of social media marketing positions and I often run into this question. It's a lot more difficult than I ever expect it to be. This place has my resume, usually has my cover letter AND they want a 140 character summary of...what? Who I am? Why I fit?

How would you condense your application into a tweet? What areas should I try to target when I type this up?

Thanks in advance!"
"This is driving me crazy. All posts, no matter what context, should include what state, province, or country you're from.","Looking for advice? Tell us where you're from.
Having a tough time in your market? Tell us where you are.
Complaining about your employer? Maybe we can sympathize so tell us where you're redditing from.

I think this is common sense and it's driving me a bit crazy. "
Passion vs Personality,"Which one of these is more important in deciding a career. For example I am passionate about economics and would love to be an economist. Now my personality is such where I don't really care about money, and so job security is important. 

Now this leads me to think of options that are less risky with decent job security like accounting. Is it wrong to say that deciding careers based on your personality is better, or pursuing your passion."
"Should I apply for a job that wants someone available immediately, even if I'm not able to start for two weeks?","Currently working a job I would need to give two weeks notice from. I found one advertised that seems perfect for me, in my field, entry-level position, and relatively close to home (in fact about half the distance to my current job). The only catch is the advertisement for this job says the candidate must be immediately available, which I know I'm unable to do unless I just walk out of my current job. I'm just looking for advice, should I even bother with applying? "
"Need to stand out? Wow hiring managers with the ""World's Smallest Cover Letter""","Here's a little way to stand out from the rest of the crowd that got me an interview with an NBA team. I used this [site](http://www.leafcutterdesigns.com/shop/wsps/tiny-letters.html) and mailed the hiring manager the ""world's smallest cover letter."" They are guaranteed to open the package and be intrigued by it.

This is what I wrote in mine:
>Dear HR Manager,
This may be the world’s smallest cover letter, but don’t let the packaging fool you, great things come in small packages. As the --job title-- for the --company--, I will do ---------. I have extensive experience in ---------- and --------- is my forte. My ---------- skills have been vital to my success and are additional strengths that I would bring to the job.  

>A small envelope wouldn’t be complete without a small favor: Give me a call to discuss how I can add value to your organization by being the --job title--

>--your name--

>--phone number--

The hiring manager LOVED it and showed it to 3 other people in the office. I didn't end up getting the job, but I definitely set myself apart from everyone else and got noticed.



btw, I am in no way affiliated with the company, I just love their products and it has helped me so I want to share my success so it can help you too.

Does anyone have experience switching job locations?,So I started working at bjs this week but I am going to college in August. There is a bjs that is about a 30 minute bus ride (I don't drive) Would I be able transfer locations and then switch back when I am home or would that be impossible?
Returning to a passed up position?,"The story so far:  

A few months ago, in January to be exact, I was offered a job at a local extermination company that I had applied to. The job had decent benefits (medical & dental, 401K, paid holidays, sick & vacation time, weekends off, etc.) and paid much more than the part time job I was working at the time.  

A couple of days before I was going to start the job I was contacted by  the NYSDOCCS and was offered a job there, again this paid more than what I was going to be paid at the pest management agency. I went in to the agency and let the managers know that I was going to be going upstate to begin working in Albany.  

I was only at he academy a week before I seriously injured myself in a car accident, which prevented me from returning. I had a lot of time to think about it and I decided that the lifestyle I would have to live working with the NYSDOCCS was not one I wanted. There's nothing wrong with it, but it isn't for me.

I recently saw that the extermination job is once again hiring. I e-mailed my resume to them once again in hopes of getting a position there, and friend of mine who works there has also told me they're hiring a lot of new employees.

I was planning on walking in and trying to speak with a manager in trying to get them to offer me the position once more. When they originally hired me they seemed enthusiastic about me starting.  

Is walking in a bad idea? Should I call first? What's the best possible course of action I can take in trying to get a job at this agency once again?"
simple way to get around doostang,"I just copied and pasted the job posting onto google with quotation marks. I ended up finding the names of the employers from other websites that have the actual post so I could apply to them directly.

Probably too obvious for some of you but I'm posting this for oblivious jerks like myself."
Is there really a skills gap/labor shortage in the (skilled) trades?,"I realize this may be difficult to answer. However I was hoping someone in this subreddit might have some insight. I think we have all heard how the skilled trades are in decline and that people are needed desperately in these fields: plumbing, electrician, pipe fitting, various mechanical technicians etc. I think you get the idea. Mike Rowe, from Dirty Jobs, has been championing the skilled trades fairly heavily. He even has a website for it. 

However, I have heard numerous statistics about this situation. One is that there is a shortage now. The other I heard is that there will be a big (Bigger?) shortage in the next 5-10 years because (apparently) the average age of these workers is quite old. I was reading the average to be in the forties and fifties. Thus, I wonder if the claim is more geared towards the future than now. Mostly, I wonder why so many people have not jumped on the skilled trades road to employment. I imagine many people are saddled with school debts and are reluctant to do more school. Of course, the skilled trades is still school and it costs money. I think this could be the main reason and I think breaking into these fields is more difficult that it sounds. However, with all the unemployed, it seems like more people should have jumped on this awhile ago or maybe not.  The economy started to get bad in 2007 and 2008. If people started a 4 year degree in that time, they would have graduated only a couple years ago. So its feasible most people just didn't know about the skilled trades (like me) and are only figuring things out too late.

For me, I will be debt free soon. I live out of the USA right now. I'm considering what I'm going to do when I get back."
Recruiter at large company does not read cover letters,I just had a phone interview with a recruiter for a large cleared defense contractor in the Washington D.C. area.  She mentioned that they do not read cover letters but just review the resumes.  She only read my cover letter because she could not find some critical information on my resume (my bad).  Just FYI.
"New grad, new job, books to read?","I've just graduated (with 2 internship experience) and I got my first job in the corporate world. What books should I read to get a good first start?

I've looked on amazon, but most of the review say ""don't read this book, use your common sense.""

Is there a book that would help me?"
Changing jobs just after starting (xpost /r/advice),"I just graduated with my Canadian bachelor's a few months ago and started at a company (Company A) 2 weeks ago. While I was interviewing with Company A, I was also interviewing with Company B, but because they have a longer interview process, I only got a job offer after being at Company A for a week and the job start date is September 1st. I have now accepted the position at Company B.

I took the job at Company A because I really, really needed the money and knew I wouldn't last until September. I am realizing that Company A is not one that I want to work for long-term and am now trying to decide on an exit strategy.
I have realized that I don't like the working conditions or management and the job is menial at best. (I have caught up in 2 weeks to staff that have been there for 6-8 weeks, and they have education levels of 2-year diplomas AT BEST.)
I suspect that I will get let go the moment I give notice and so I am tempted to give only 1 week of notice instead of 2.

Note: I have yet to officially accept Company A's letter of proposal and it was only provided to me after I had already started there. In contrast, Company B already sent me an official offer and will be sending me the employment contract this week for advance reading.

TL;DR Should I inform my boss at my 2 week old job in 2 weeks(1 week notice) or next week(2 week notice) if I strongly suspect I will get let go immediately."
Should I trust my gut feeling and discard this job opportunity?,"Hi all,

I would like to hear your opinion and advice about a mixed experience I am having for a job opportunity and my participation in psycho-analytical tests during the recruitement process.

I have 15 years of experience as an IT professional, both in technical and managerial roles. With ups and downs, I have grown a valuable list of experiences of which I'm quite proud (in an humble way). From educational perspective, I hold a Master's Degree in Engineering with major in computer science, I am a PMI-PMP certified project manager, I hold several technical certifications and am tri-lingual.

Recently a recruiter from a well known company in my region contacted me to discuss my interest in a teamleader position in the IT-department . In the first round, I had a good conversation in their office with the HR recruitement lady, then the week after I was invited for a follow up interview. This second interview started with a 1-hour conversation with the IT Director : this was an excellent experience and I really felt that there could be a match with a lot of valuable benefits to achieve together for the company. I felt I could support the local departement to improve some of their inefficiencies and resolve some of the ""pains"" that the IT Director was dealing with while working to establish a multi-year roadmap for backoffice applications. This conversation was followed by an ""interview"" with the IT Architect of the department : this was really an inferior experience from interpersonal perspective, which right away gave me a very bad gut feeling about the position and the whole dynamics in the department. From what I heard, my conclusion is that the guy was sucking energy away from the teams. Our conversation was extremely technically oriented and didn't leave ANY room for interpersonal interaction (I did pretty well on the technical subjects I think). When I tried to create an opening towards the end of the conversation, my perception was that this person's character is really kind of unbalanced :  I think he is one of the reasons which negatively influence the vibes  of the teams and the interpersonal interactions (of course, this is a preliminary conclusion, I cannot make a final evaluation about a person after just 45 minutes of interaction, but I need to do with that snapshot to make my current opinion about the job opportunity).

Anyway, when the HR recruiter called me the next day to discuss my perception and feedback, she acknowledged the difficulties that people have in interacting with this IT Architect. We agreed to continue the recruitement process because the IT Director and me both had a really good mutual feeling about a potential collaboration with each other. However, I remain highly concerned because this IT Architect would be on the same hierarchical level as me and I would need to collaborate with him very intensively daily : if constantly there a difficult interpersonal interaction, then frustration and negative vibes will slumber around the corner…. I could start to hate my job after only a couple of months.

Now comes the real issue. As part of the recruitement process, they also asked me to fulfil an online psycho-analytical assessment. One of the components in this assessment was 'logical reasoning' : the test was showing 5 graphical patterns of figures and asked for the 6th 'logical follow up pattern'. This Sunday afternoon, I was exercising and doing intensive sports for 3 hours. When I came home, I decided to finish the assessment and perform this 'logical reasoning' test (because I don’t have time fort his on weekdays) : unfortunately, I did badly - only 60% of the questions completed within the timeframe given and it makes me really disturbed.

Now, to be clear, and in all modesty, I don't have any doubt about my abilities to perform very good logical reasoning, as has been obvious in the past 30 years of secondary school, college, university, and professional career. Again in all modesty, I often feel like I perform as one of the best during professional assignments and I hold very high standards when delivering my work, often thinking far outside the strict borders of my job, making sure all aspects of an assignment logically match end to end.This is recognised and appreciated by peers,management and customers. Moreover, a couple of weeks ago I performed a similar trial test on www.jobtestprep.co.uk and had a percentile 95 score for a similar test with logical patterns. However, today I really performed bad – I’m concerned about the context in which this is embedded. 

Now, to end my post, I must say that I found the whole framework and outcome of these tests somewhat humiliating. A 24-minute test would need to objective my intellectual capabilities to perform logical reasoning and be taken as an important argument in hiring me or not. The experience worsened my gut feeling about the job and the company. In the past years, I have learned to rely more on my instincts : I also read several articles in the past years that said never to underestimate the importance of your gut feeling and instincts.
On the other hand, this company is really one of the top players in my region and it would be a very relevant professional experience for a couple of years with good pay. I also sincerly feel that I have the skills to really make a difference in that department and to improve the dynamics, energy and performance of the team. On the other hand I currently have a job and I don’t need to make a career step with urgency.

Coming to a conclusion, my current idea is to discard the whole opportunity (with some pain in my heart) based on my gut feeling and the high risk that I see in very difficult interpersonal interactions with that IT Architect. Moreover, I feel that this psycho-analytical test is badly timed and interferes with more fundamental elements about the job that should have been prioritised.

Your opinion would be highly appreciated.



"
I just got a job and would like to give back.,"So I was recently hired for a position utilizing my sciencey background, engineering and math and I graduated last year, but it took until now for me to find a job.

Here are some of the facts that I learned while adventuring as I see it.

* Being unemployed does not mean you do not have a job. To the contrary, your job is to find a job, three applications a day is more than enough. While on this train of thought, it is important to apply to jobs that you want to do, if you think you will be unhappy and you get an interview it will likely show through. If you are in dire need of a job, take anything, help neighbors (not necessarily for pay because it is a good thing), and stay positive.

* If you can still rely upon your parents for support do so. This allows you to focus more time on your job search because well you want to get out and be on your own. For me, I was living with my mother in section 8 housing and she didn't have internet but the local library had free wifi and it was a seven minute walk. Thus, I would go to the library for work and keeping tabs on news, not for videos or other things.

* Network. Yes I know that this is beaten in your head, but my concept of networking involves using friends and family as well as personal connections, but not to acquire a job, but to ask them if they know anyone who might know anything. This does several things, it avoids placing them into an awkward situation for them to say no if you were to ask them for a job, it informs them that you are seeking and the field in which you are seeking, it casts your net wider.

* Resumes ideally should be at most one page. As always there are exceptions, but in my instance I kept mine at a page until last October when my article was published which meant adding three lines to a full, not stuffed, page. Prior to this I had messed with formatting, awards were in two columns, and font size was 11. With the publication, I changed the font size to 12 and made the award list into a single column. I also lead with my education and grade point, I am proud of mine so I display it, followed by experience and I believe that 3 is ideal and you do not need to show continuous employment. When it comes to an objective, I am a little torn it really depends on your experience and what you are looking for, some of my resumes had it some did not, this was the only piece of my resume which was customized but only by field.

* Cover Letters: I originally started off with one generic cover letter for engineering and this got me one or two nibbles but was not the way to go. My cover letters were far more effective when I had them targeted toward field, such as engineering, modeling, analyst. One page is again what I strove for, the HR person or recruiter does not have that much time on his hands so shorter is better. Also I was never good at plugging in keywords, there is an art to this that I did not master.

* Preparation. Should you have an interview there are a few tips that saved me. When the recruiter/HR gives you a call out of the blue they will usually announce whom they are and the company, this is a great time to say, ""Hey, now is not a great time to talk can we talk tomorrow at 3?"" A recruiter would love nothing better than to catch you unawares, this gives you time to prepare while also demonstrating that you can think on your feet. For your interviews, I know we all spend far too much time on Reddit/Internet... Interviews are like final exams, there are people who can ace them without studying but the vast majority of us plebians need to study and prepare. Each interview is different but first ones are usually screening interviews, don't close any doors like relocating, and know details about company and position. Second interviews can be behavioral/situational, this means much more preparation, I probably prepared for about twelve hours the week prior for the job I was just offered. In person interviews can be an entirely separate can of worms, prepare some more. At the end of my interview process I probably had 7 pages of situational questions and responses and 2 pages of questions that I was ready to ask. A good tactic is to ask about their experiences and get them to talk about their life. Everyone's favorite topic is yours truly.

* How I was hired... I networked. A friend's parent is an executive at the company, but this only got me past the first screening stage, and even then I had to stay flexible in my responses, no closing doors. I remember seeing stats about referrals that those who are referred have a 50x higher chance of being hired, this is where the network comes in, they can't help you if they don't know you are looking or what you are looking for. For the final interview, I was able to have a conversation, not an interrogation, and I asked more questions of the interviewer than they did of me. I asked about what they enjoyed and how they adapted and got them to talk about their experiences."
Reminder: Remember to check out your employer's website or know what they do before your interview,"We just interviewed a software dev and the guy doesn't even know what my employer do. My manager can't accept that and I agree. It say a lot about you if you didn't even bother to do your basic homework before interview.

How can anyone miss this? It's basic interview 101."
Good Article for Writing Cover Letter,"In two recent job submissions, I used the third paragraph of my cover letter to discuss the soft skills that I would bring to the company.  I found that this article has fiveteen different soft skills that you can use in your cover letter to sell an employer on your soft skills in  a cover letter

Any advice would be appreciated.,"So as of right now I am working 2 jobs. One I hate and the other I enjoy. Both are only part time, but one pays more than the other.

A little background first. I went to Culinary School and ended up dropping out due to depression and family illness. I have worked as a cook/line cook for 10 years, and have 2 years of management experience. I walked out of my job in early 2013 and spent 8+months searching for work. I finally got a job washing dishes at the local Denny's for minimum wage. 3 days after I got the job, I was contacted by a grocery store that I had put in application in and forgotten about. I went through hiring process and was hired making $8.50 an hour. I was thrilled. Fast Forward 2 months and I am regretting having 2 jobs. I work til 11pm at denny's then have to go to work at the grocery store at 6am sometimes 5am. I am working about 45 hours a week now and maybe get 1 day off a week.

  I absolutely dread going to work at Denny's. I work 4 days (now that they cut my hours) usually only 5-6 hours shifts. The only thing I dread about working at the grocery store is the lack of sleep I have between the 2 jobs. 

  I really want to quit Denny's but I feel obligated to them because they gave me a job after 8 months of searching. I just don't see a future with them, because I realize I can make more money elsewhere. They want me to become a cook for them, but they want me to do the online training on my time. (Which I don't have much of.)

Sorry for the wall of text just need some kind of advice. TL;DR I have 2 jobs and hate 1, but feel obligated to quit the job I hate.
"
Need advice dealing with unreasonable subordinate,"There is a supervisor, subordinate to me, who has been at my current job slightly longer than I have (8 years vs 7). I've been promoted to be his superior as his schedule has been limited, he had some earlier health issues which cost him to miss a lot of work, etc.

Recently he got sick again. With no vacation time left and no sick time left either, I put in, with my boss' in-writing blessing' 40 hours but told him I would have to take some vacation time initially to cover my ass. 

We had a meeting discussing his future and decided on a modified schedule until he gets back on his feet. I told him about what I was going to do as my hands are tied and it isn't my money...He seemed fine with it as he left.

He later threw it back in my face via email that I am exacerbating the situation, making life stressful and hellish for him and now he says he'll go on disability and doesn't know if/when he'll be back.

From a quick phone conversation with my boss regarding this, I also found out he'd been making comments about me to my superiors. Nothing egregious, but enough that they had to take notice and were monitoring the situation. Of course this whole situation skews them towards my side, thankfully.

Given that, I'm basically done with him and will be happy when he's gone. But he's the type of person who will stick around out of spite.

So I guess my question is this: How do I make this problem employee leave while still covering my own ass?

tldr: Help an employee, get shit on by same employee. Best way to subtly push him out the door?"
How trustworthy is CyberCoders?,I'm going to be graduating college in May and I've started looking for full time jobs in the Web Development field. I've been searching around and have my fair share of staffing companies and recruiting companies contact me via linked in. I stumbled upon CyberCoders and was wondering what their deal was? Do they get a portion of my first year's pay check? How do companies like CyberCoders work? Are they trustworthy? Do they try and find you A job or THE RIGHT job?
Would like some opinions on my current situation of temp employment.,"I will just lay this out in a simple timeline and then add a little blurb at the end for my real question.

Sept  - Get hired for temp to hire position at large company along with one other person, told they are trying to fill two permanent positions within 6 months.

Sept - Dec  - Consistently told by my supervisor as well as temp company that I am exceeding expectations.

End of Dec - supervisor tells me she is moving ahead to get the authorization to offer me full position. 

January - Supervisor leaves company, replaced by previous supervisor who had left to work for different emerging department. 

End of January -  Other temp is fired for bad attitude and underwhelming performance.

February - Temp pulled from different department and brought in to replace him, I do all of the training for the position.

March- This is my 6th month and I ask about the permanent position and whether or not it will happen, reassured that they are going to, but issues with budget are delaying it.

Now - Still told that budget is holding it back but as soon as its cleared I will be offered the position.


I am a no longer recent grad (finished Dec of 2012) my student loans are too large monthly for me to pay on the temp wage but manageable on the permanent position's salary. I like the job, the benefits and salary are more than acceptable assuming I get hired.It feels as though I am just going to be stuck in an endless temp position losing money and getting further behind.

Not sure what my options are, I have not been actively looking for a perm position while in this role, mostly because my resume falls a little flat, good education, but have only had a series of 3-6 month temp positions with no permanent positions. Not sure I can wait this out much longer, but feel that jumping to another temp position would be even worse.

Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do?

Looking for Job search advice!!,"I guess this is as good a place as any to put this.  I was wondering if anyone knew of some good jobs that may be around my area.  I live in Colorado Springs, CO and have recently been laid off.  So I was curious if anyone knows of job openings in their community or workplace.  I would be willing to travel 50 miles in any direction.  Before anyone asks, I do not have a degree yet, although I am 12 credits away from my associates.  I know that means squat until I actually get the degree, but I just wanted to show everyone that I am working towards something.  I have no trade skills, but a long work history.  I would prefer to make $13 to $14 dollars an hour just to sustain myself but obviously there will come a time when I won't be able to be picky.  It took me 8 years to get to the level financially I was at before with a company.  I have applied to many many places and only a few callback and 2 interviews with no success.  Even if you live out of my state, maybe you know of something near me.  Also does anyone know how much unemployment is in Colorado.  I know it's a percentage of your income but I don't know how much.  Thanks to all in advance.  "
Traveling jobs or relocation Jobs ?,"I'm only 18 years old, kind of bored at home and with my life in general. I would really love to travel around the US, out of the country, really anywhere and willing to do any type of job. I had 2 pervious jobs in Fast Food but quit them one due to me moving, and other due to manager lying about position. Haven't had much with finding other work since then. 

I was looking into cruise ship jobs or flight attendant jobs but couldn't find much, I also speak fluent Spanish as a second language and have my Passport ready. Looked into peace corps but it seems they want people with experience or degrees.

I also have cousins in Costa Rica but by looking up jobs laws I wouldn't be able to work for any companies there unless I was paid by a company abroad or something like that. But opens to any ideas/suggestions.

Pay isn't really important to me as long as airfare is covered or discounted. Ok with volunteering as well as long as there is a allowance and airfare is free or discounted.

I have about $1,000 cash to my name to support my self too."
Interview Advice from an Interviewing Manager (X post from r/careersuccess),"**This is a X post from r/careersuccess - the original post is here [r/careersuccess/originalpost](http://www.reddit.com/r/CareerSuccess/comments/3abdh7/interview_advice_from_an_interviewing_manager/)**

Why do people write so much about this topic? Isn't it like educating the masses to wear a black belt with black pants? Shouldn't everyone know this already?!

Surprisingly, people write about this because candidates still make rookie mistakes in interviews. From my own experience, I interviewed three people in the last four weeks, and I heard and saw some crazy things. Interviews can be intense, so let's go over a few Do's and Don'ts:

**INTRODUCTIONS**

Do: Stand up, make eye contact, and shake their hand firmly
Don't: Shake their hand while sitting down

This is kind of the ABCs of introductions, but it is surprising how many people do not shake hands and do not rise when introduced to you. Whenever I am introduced to someone new, whether they are below me in position or above, I always make sure to stand up. Maybe it is something that the military taught me, but it is a sign of respect. Doing so will show that you respect the person, and they tend to remember you better. Also, give a firm handshake. You are not trying to break the person's fingers, but the worst handshakes are like holding a dead fish.

**RESUME**

Do: Bring along a copy of your resume in case
Don't: Bring in a different resume than the one you submitted

I had a candidate bring in their resume, which was drastically different than the one I had previously read. It had much more detail than the one I had been given, and given that I had a limited amount of time with him, I didn't have time to read it. It was a waste of effort on his part. As an interviewer, it made me think that he hadn't prepared properly when submitting his application in the first place, and the drastic difference in content made me wonder if he had embellished the new copy. Most interviewers will not take the time to read a new resume during your interview, so do not bother. They will be more focused on hearing you speak than reading.

If you really have no idea which resume you sent them, then bring in your most updated resume and only offer it if they do not already have a copy handy. Most interviewers will have your resume with them when they enter the room.

**ENERGY**

Do: Show a lot of energy and passion about what you are applying for
Don't: Show too much energy or negative energy about where you are trying to leave

As an interviewer for my team, I am looking for someone that will bring passion and energy to the position I am offering. This would apply to a data entry person, all the way to an electrician. Everyone wants to hire someone that shows passion for what they do and that will want to come in to work everyday. And hopefully by sharing your energy, you will make them WANT to have you there everyday.

If a candidate is very quiet and doesn't smile, I tend to wonder if they even want the position I am offering. I will try to smile back at them or will raise my energy in an attempt to draw out their more excited side. If your energy is too low, I will also ask the question, ""What kind of energy will you bring to the team?"" Some people have caught onto this and will show more excitement, but others have answered this in a monotone voice, and that is when I know that I have the wrong person.

**ANSWERING QUESTIONS**

Do: Give a thorough and precise answer
Don't: Spend 10-15 minutes doing so for each question

I try to give every person at least 60 minutes for an interview, so that I have time to feel them out and answer any of their questions; unfortunately, I have more recently been limited to 30 minutes. That is a very short time in Interview Land. When a question is asked, answer the question thoroughly with details, but keep your answers short. This can be hard, because you want to share all of your knowledge, but the worst thing you could do is drone on and on. I recently had an interview where the candidate kept talking for 15 minutes straight, and it was to the point that I couldn't remember the question I asked. And at the end, she couldn't either!

If you find yourself forgetting the original question, you have gone too far. Instead, if your answer is multifaceted, give the high-level answer and then offer to provide details if they would like more information. As an example, if someone asked me how to make a Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwich, I would advice them that I would prepare my work area, collect the ingredients needed, make my sandwich, clean my tools, and then put my sandwich on a plate for consumption. I would then offer to give more detail if they wanted more than this.

**ASKING QUESTIONS**

Do: Prepare a list of questions
Don't: Turn the tables on your interviewer

Always prepare a list of questions to ask during interviews. It shows the interviewer that you are curious about working there and that you invested time in your potential future there. Sometimes I had inadvertently answered the candidate's questions before they have a chance--and that's ok. When you are asked if you have any questions, say something to the effect of, ""I had a list of questions, but you answered my question regarding X, Y, and Z already.""

When I say ""Don't turn the tables on your interviewer,"" I mean that you shouldn't ask questions of your interviewer that they may ask you. For example, I interviewed someone in the past that wanted to know about what I did at the job, what I liked and didn't like, and what my 5 year goals were. These are interesting questions, and I didn't mind answering them, but it changed the mood of the interview so that we left on an awkward foot. If the hiring manager will be your direct manager, you can ask them what their expectations are, or perhaps what would prevent you from getting the position, but keep it at surface level questions (expectations, pay/benefits, hours of operations, etc). A fun question I like to be asked is what a typical day looks like.

For my nervous friends...

If you tend to get nervous and forget things, as some people do (myself included sometimes), write down your questions or any ideas that you want to make sure you hit. This again shows that you are prepared and spent time doing so, and it will help to jog your memory when your adrenaline is racing.

I learned the hard way... Interview Advice / RANT,"I'm an Art Director/Graphic Designer in New York City, arguably one of the most competitive arenas in the biz. After applying for a position, 1st, 2nd and then 3rd interview, meeting over 10 people in the company, touring the office, yada yada... I didn't get the job. 

I learned quite a few things in the process and after living the disappointment, here I am, here's what I learned (from feedback and self reflection): 

- The interview process is a game, and a competition of sorts. There are other people in it to win it! Don't let your guard down, and don't get comfortable. The moment you begin to get cocky, feel like you have the job, feel like you are winning and think you are getting positive feedback, you need to SLOW YOUR ROLL. All those intuitions may be true, but until paperwork is signed, nothing is final. 

- Be honest, but tell them what they want to hear at the same time. I mean... you need to work on phrasing strengths, weaknesses, fears, excitements in a way that is professional and appealing.  

- Make sure you KNOW the position and all the duties before you go into an interview! This will help SIGNIFICANTLY. You can even rephrase some of the requirements as items you are skilled at. Do not ever walk into an interview without clear expectations, otherwise you are walking into a deathtrap of uncertainty. 

- NEVER discuss title or money until they actually offer you a position, and want to know your ""magic"" number. Don't even mention it in passing. A time will come for this, but it may not happen until after 3+ interviews. ** If they ask where you see yourself in the company, never name positions, or titles-- focus on the big picture. 

- Care more about the company than your own needs. Be more interested in the team, office atmosphere, and good work, than your personal gain. 

- Never talk about your personal life unless it is directly relevant. Small talk is perfectly acceptable, but avoid the 3: politics, sex, religion. Don't ever make your social life seem important. Your family, friends, things you do are irrelevant unless they are specifically asked about. 

- Try to always do your interviews in person! Phone, Skype, etc. can skew people's perspective of you and body language is very hard to read!

And just some of the tough questions I was asked:

1. Where do you see yourself in 3 years?

2. What do you fear the most if you started working here?

3. Have you ever worked with/managed a team?

4. What was your most challenging project?

FYI: headhunter does not care about you,"My employer is looking to add another person to our team even though I don't think they got enough work for us all but whatever. I've never been on the other end of the table and I was surprised to be included in the interview process since I'm just a grunt. A email was forwarded to me by my manager along with the conversion of our hr and headhunter. Basically, this kid with 2yrs experiences is seeking $70k but since he is unemployed at the moment. The headhunter said he believe he can talk him down to $65k.

I guess if you're desperate you might take the job but this show that headhunter doesn't care about you. They get paid from employer and not you so they want to get you in as fast as they can so they can make bank. "

Real Tips for Getting a Job for Entry-Level Candidates and During Recessionary Periods: Based on Theory that not all interviewers are looking for what's best for the employer.,"Jobs: you work, they pay. Simple, right? Hardly! This article briefly discusses other intangibles that are exchanged in an employment relationship. It focuses on a particular type of intangible that takes away value from that exchange in favor of an ""intermeddler."" Please read the whole post to understand the theory. The practical tips are at the end of the post. 

At the simplest level, the fundamental exchange between an employer and employee is money for labor. That labor can be further differentiated into physical and knowledge-based efforts. However, far more is exchanged in the employment relationship than this. I am not referring to fringe benefits and health insurance, rather I am referring to the intangibles that permeate the work environment. In most cases, the intangibles are not significant, but in industries or sectors where the supply of employment positions is low relative to the availability of labor, these intangibles become significant. Such a scenario can present itself during recessions as well as for entry-level positions even in a good economy. 

The intangibles can be analogized to economic externalities because they are difficult to isolate, identify, and measure. But anyone with work experience can confirm, based on personal experience, that these intangibles, at least, exist. Quantifying them is another matter and perhaps is a discussion to be had later. Some of these intangibles include, superfluous personality traits as well as social affiliations. To clarify, certain personality traits are supportive of a good working relationship, we know them from job descriptions: cooperative, team player, engaged with colleagues, professional, optimistic. However, others are superfluous because while they may serve the personal interests of the hiring official, they are not needed for the position or for the employer’s needs, such as: interest in a particular cuisine, music, hobby, or political affiliation. We will call these superfluous personality traits as “SPT” for short. 

Next, we have social affiliations that are also superfluous. Some organizations, particularly public or non-profit, expressly disallow favoritism for family members. However, other affiliations such as alma mater, church, social group, regional upbringing, can also influence the hiring official. Generally, these similarities may make it easy for the hiring official to assimilate and befriend the newly, hired human resource, but as far as the organization is concerned these are superfluous vis-a-vis concrete skills, education, and experience. We will call these superfluous social affiliations or “SSA” for short. 

Now that we have discussed the intangibles, I will present a sample scenario. The employer has Need A. Need A requires Skill A, Education A, and Experience A. Each category of ability can have levels of development (say, I, II, III). First, the potential employee ideally should have each ability and next the higher level of development they have the better, faster, and more precisely, they can fulfill Need A.

In an ideal world, the employer would locate the perfectly qualified candidate and pay them the worth of their contributions. But the reality is that organizations are filtered through humans. And humans are not always perfectly aligned with the organization. In these instances, the hiring official may have his or her own needs: fun or reliable subordinates (SPT); or wishes to do do a favor for the country club or neighbor (SSA). These personal needs, when they trump the fundamental Need A of the organization, do a disservice to the organization because the organization hires someone who is not the most optimum for the position and other workers have to accordingly pick up slack for that sub-par person. 

A hiring official that allows his or her superfluous and personal preferences influence the hiring process can be fairly called an “inter-meddler” in the employer-employee exchange. What they are doing is incrementally taking away value from the relationship. 


When the organizational (legitimate) need is very high and those with the requisite skills is heterogeneous (i.e., few candidates are similar) it becomes harder and harder for the inter-meddler to justify hiring an inferior candidate based on the intangible and superfluous traits. However, where there is a seemingly homogenous population, this kind of behavior becomes more difficult to tease out.
Those in entry-level hiring markets who have roughly similar skills as peers are more likely to have experienced this. As well as, recessionary periods when large numbers of people with roughly the same level of ability are looking for work. 

Now for the possibly valuable advice: How can someone who thinks they are facing this situation tackle this problem? 

For one, seek to differentiate yourself from your peers. Become “heterogeneous.” In other words, if you have a particular strength or unique experience in a certain area, look for positions that need and demand that skill. This will make it hard for you to be denied a position by an intermeddling decision-maker. Next, be sure to deeply understand the need of the employer. Remember that even job descriptions are filtered through people and the people may not accurately convey what the employer is in need of. So, understand the industry, the role, the typical duties, and determine for yourself at the end of the day what needs to be accomplished. Next, look at your skills, experience, and education, and objectively and quantitatively enumerate those abilities you have and tie them to the position need. This will drive home that you are a heterogeneous and exceptional candidate that should not be subordinated in favor of another candidate who will not be able to meet the need of the organization. 

On the flip-side: How can an enlightened organization address this potential problem?

It is important to have broad policies that go beyond disallowing family-based nepotism. Additionally, requiring post-interview rubrics that are quantitative and require articulation of concrete skills, education, and experience based reasons with citation will make it challenging for an intermeddler to justify why they want an inferior candidate. In turn, the organization will be less likely to lose value by hiring sub-par candidates and existing employees will be relieved of picking up slack in instances where this happens.

This is obviously one theory based on anecdotal evidence. However, it is food for thought. Think about it, if you have ever found yourself in this type of situation, about the plausibility of this model and whether the intangibles are significant enough to be addressed by an organization.

Request for advice,"Hi, new to this sub!  
  
I am looking for an IT/Programming/Computer related job.  
  
I have an Associate's degree, 2 of three years towards a BS in programming, and a Pharmacy Technician Certification. Also, I have about 4 years of medical experience working at the pharmacy (2y), a Doctors office (9mo), and a Hospital (1y, 3mo), the latter two dealing with Medical Records.  I'm currently with my company for 3 years.  
  
I also have a nice amount of programming experience, making two video games, an electronic medical record system (in progress; my side project), and a few classes worth of programs which taught object-oriented structures.  
  
I'm looking for this in really any location, and to get my foot in the door. I currently make ~$12/h part-tie, so anything around or above that rate, and full time would be great. I need to find a school to finish off that year of BS, but would like to know my chances of getting a job to finish school part time, as I'm already 25/married, and the wife wants us to start getting financially ready for kiddies. She'll finish in June with a BS in animation to go with her BS in painting, so we're not too worried.  
  
Other than the above, I just got injured and have been out for 2 weeks, and would love a desk job of sorts to help with the ankle injury.  
  
I'd appreciate any assistance and advice available.

Finding candidates in niche technologies,"When it comes to hiring for niche or new technologies like mobile app developers, php developers, asp.net developers or php programmers, do you find it tough to search and hire the right talent. "
Changing jobs just after starting (xpost /r/advice),"I just graduated with my Canadian bachelor's a few months ago and started at a company (Company A) 2 weeks ago. While I was interviewing with Company A, I was also interviewing with Company B, but because they have a longer interview process, I only got a job offer after being at Company A for a week and the job start date is September 1st. I have now accepted the position at Company B.

I took the job at Company A because I really, really needed the money and knew I wouldn't last until September. I am realizing that Company A is not one that I want to work for long-term and am now trying to decide on an exit strategy.
I have realized that I don't like the working conditions or management and the job is menial at best. (I have caught up in 2 weeks to staff that have been there for 6-8 weeks, and they have education levels of 2-year diplomas AT BEST.)
I suspect that I will get let go the moment I give notice and so I am tempted to give only 1 week of notice instead of 2.

Note: I have yet to officially accept Company A's letter of proposal and it was only provided to me after I had already started there. In contrast, Company B already sent me an official offer and will be sending me the employment contract this week for advance reading.

TL;DR Should I inform my boss at my 2 week old job in 2 weeks(1 week notice) or next week(2 week notice) if I strongly suspect I will get let go immediately."

How to act in a office?,"Hello all!

I started working in a office since this Monday. I am a customer service representative and it’s my first desk job. When I came in, I found out my boss was going to be gone for this week and he said he’ll “probably be back next week.” This is really weird to me and I was basically anxious these past few days. I’m so used to a boss being around, telling me when to take breaks, and being introduced to the people there. My boss had to teach my about my job over the phone. I kept asking people around the office if I work with them, if they’ve interacted with my boss before( didn’t find any information), and then people there were not really explaining about parking or the free food. Since I am a anxious person, I try to talk to people around me but they don’t seem interested. So I was wondering how do I act in a office especially since I’m the only employee of my bosses company. I already have views about this desk job and it’s boring, pays good, but I’m not sure if this is what I want."

AWS (Seattle) experience? I have an interview today,"An internal Amazon recruiter contacted me for a legal role with AWS in Seattle. Always nice to be approached, that's for sure. I'm solidly based in L.A., but this is very tempting. If all goes well, of course.They cover relocation costs, and I already know Amazon pays top of market. The corporate culture at Amazon, however, and especially Amazon Studios, has a terrible reputation. I got to a final interview years ago for the Studios and their arrogance was unbelievable. Not to mention it was a 6 hour gauntlet that forced me to take a day off of work! That said, I'm wondering if maybe AWS and not being in L.A. is a different story?

Does anyone here have direct experience working for AWS or know someone reliable who does? Just hoping to have an idea of what I might be getting into. Thanks in advance!"
What do people do in office jobs?,"I know there’s probably a super obvious answer here, but all the people who sit in a cubicle all day, what exactly are you doing? And how do these activities profit the company to the point that they pay you a salary?

Be nice, I’m just wondering because I’ve always worked in the blue collar and am ignorant as to what happens in the big corporate offices.

Edit: sorry the flair doesn’t fit but I had to pick one and couldn’t find any that applied

You should stop participating in Indeed’s online assessments: and here’s why.,"Let’s talk about Indeed Assessments.

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)"
New job is possibly incredibly toxic,"Hey everyone,

I just started at my new job on monday. I was never told what the work would ensue, other than the fact that it's office work, m-f 9-5 with some insane benefits. Seems too good to be true, especially because they're hiring during this pandemic.

This job already rubs me the wrong way, and today was my first day of work after training. The work itself is simple, however it seems mistakes still can be costly.

I was the only one to wear a mask on every day in the office this week. Heck, the only one to wear a mask any day of the week.

There are two breaks, and while lunch is provided, you have to work while you eat. On each 15 minute break, you must also move your car, as the business has no parking.

Management has been cold, distant, and accusatory.

Am I imagining all of this, or is this actually an incredibly toxic work enviornment?"
New job seems scheme-ish,"Due to the difficulty of finding employment right now, I've been rapid-fire applying to jobs. I got an interview from one of my rapid-fire applications, and was subsequently offered a job; I gave them a tentative yes. 

The job seemed run-of-the-mill for my field, a step up from what I usually do, but nothing out of the ordinary. However, the interview set off some alarm bells.

The first thing that seemed off is that we would spend a couple hours every day doing development workshops with speakers from around the world. This seems like a massive waste of company resources to do this daily, and a waste of my time as I wouldn't be paid for this time. 

The other thing is that out of an 8 hour day, I'm only paid for 4 of those hours. The pay is okay enough to make up for it, but I'd be paid based on performance; which apparently means I could make anywhere from $600 to $1200 a week, which seems strange.

The last thing is just how unconventional the company seems; in the interview, I was told I would be making six-figures if I stuck around for a year or two (huh??) and the company has apparently grown from 1 to 20 offices in two years of existence.

There is also no information about the company anywhere on the internet, except for on their website which, to their credit, looks very legit and professional.

Sound familiar to anybody? Should I just bail?"

Is it normal to be stressed before my first day on the job?,On Friday I got a call from the temp agency I’m employed from that they had a job for me. Its a warehouse job where I’m racking parts (thats what they told me?). I’m getting really bad anxiety about my new job and I want to crawl in a hole and die. Any advice?
Minor anxiety at amazon,"So my training is done, got my first paycheck, my second evaluation was “meh”  but the issue that hits my head is that when I’m assigned to the freezer, the PPE is not for my size , and it slows me down, and the there is little to no space to stow stuff and I have told this to the manager but nothing has been done yet. Just told me “use one hand and warm the other” which...It doesn’t feel like good advice. They want us to do 300 Units per hour but I have no idea how to calculate that.  I know it has to be 5 per minute and by 30  mins I have to hit 150  and I’m like...How??? So far it’s been the hardest part of the job, to keep up “these spectations” and the indirects they have of “there’s always someone  behind who can replace you” which just feels that is far the opposite of what the training videos have said. 

I just don’t know if I should quit and look for another job aSAP that pays the same and weekly for the summer because I need the money for my next nursing semester. Is there some advice I can get ?"

Am i making a rash decision in going to grad school after i got a rescind letter from my first job as a recent college graduate ?,"Hello !

yesterday, i unforunately received a rescinded letter from a company as a recent college graduate. However, considering with all the crap that is going on right now, should i try to ride it out with a masters ?

&#x200B;

the reason that im asking if this is a rash decision is because grad school was literally not on my radar and getting a rescinded letter was not something that i was expecting especially after graduating 3 days ago.

&#x200B;

what should i do ? i know there are going to be many angles of approach in terms of ""what i should do"" but im open to hearing what your guys' input might be.

&#x200B;

Thanks !

edit: initially, i had plans of pursuing a masters while i was working... and i cant pursue a masters without pulling out loans. "

Medical tech startup has no Glassdoor presence despite being several years old--red flag?,"I'm going through the interview process at a medical tech startup that's been around for a few years (between 3-8 years). It seems to have a viable product used by actual hospitals, a professional website with pictures of a couple dozen or so staff (wearing company swag, so it's not a stock photo), and mentions in legitimate, non-PR publications, so I was surprised that it had no Glassdoor presence whatsoever. Not just a profile with one review, or no reviews, but not even a presence, despite the job also being listed on Glassdoor--is this common? Something to be suspicious of? Every other job I've been looking at seems to have a presence."
Did I make a mistake in moving for a new job?,"TL;DR- New job has same job title as old job but they aren’t the same job at all!

A bit of a back story as to why I took the new job is because I needed a change for my mental health. For the past 3 years, I’ve been living in Austin. About 10 months ago, I had a pretty bad sports accident that led to an amputation (think Alex Smith injury if he didn’t recover). Anywell, I wasn’t really trying for a new job, but I got an interview with this company in Tampa Bay for the same position title and pay.


I was a planner with high stress, was frustrated a lot, and ran into more problems that I was more likely to be yelled at for screwing up than being recognized for all the solutions I had for highly escalated problems. But I still loved it as the people there were awesome and I did like that it challenged me. All my coworkers were my friends in and out of work, I had more of a mother/son relationship more than an employer/employee relationship with my boss, and half the group was my age (26M) which might’ve made things there more tolerable.


Even during the interview, I kinda got the sense this wouldn’t be the same position after some of the questions I asked, but I figured it might’ve been because my former company is pretty backwards in terms of their processes. And I wanted to give them a shot.


I just started my new position this week and it’s not the same position despite the title. My old position had me making semiconductors and having to coordinate between finance, PM’s, engineers, logistics, manufacturing and purchasing, having to review BOM’s, look for parts and just find solutions to weird problems. I felt like I was playing human chess coordinating 30 different moving pieces to get my tools built on time, or an armchair QB. At my new position, I’m doing none of that. I’m basically stocking up line side/bulk parts to the manufacturing floor and ordering new parts like AA batteries and smocks and gloves and power tools. While I get that this stuff has to be ordered, it just seems weird that someone (me) has to manage that whereas my old place was just ordered.


And a lot of the stuff I’m supposed to be doing are things we had logistics people, Material Coordinators and purchasing departments for. Mind you both are fortune 100 companies and this current company is in aerospace and defense... And I wouldn’t mind it so much except for my disability. I’m not close to the MFG floor or some of the stock rooms or even the parking lot so I have to constantly move. And being an above knee amputee take 2x more energy to walk 2mph... I don’t mind walking every once in a while, but I’m usually physically drained and can barely get to my car by the time I leave. Like, I took the job thinking I’d be a planner for like a tank or building the next line of space shuttles/rockets for NASA; not a glorified stockroom gatekeeper.


At least in my old company, I learned a bunch of things from all the different departments which helped me be better and could see myself trying many different jobs, and I could see myself becoming an engineer or a project manager (Which is my goal by the time I’m 30). I don’t think I’m giving my new company a fair shot as I literally just started. There’s nothing bad to say about any of my new coworkers so far and my supervisor seems really nice, but I don’t see near the same growth opportunity, if there is any, in my current position.

Do you think it was a bad move for me to quit a job I loved and was good at? And how long should I give this job a shot before finding a new position?"

How normal is miscommunication/disorganization in a company?,"I've worked at a non-profit for about two years, and the one thing I've noticed about this company is that none of its employees have any idea what it does as a whole. I routinely hear from clients that some of my co-workers told them completely wrong information about our programs. I actually got cursed out today by a client who'd been told one thing by a co-worker only to have me tell her something completely different. I always verify any information with my boss, but it's clear that my co-workers (most of whom work at a different location) don't do the same. I'll tell my boss about these issues without dropping names, and at our monthly meetings she'll go over what's right and what's wrong. The problem? Nobody ever seems to remember what she says at these meetings, and the same problems happen all over again.

My boss herself is disorganized; she never remembers what she did or didn't train/tell us. Occasionally, she'll come up to me and go ""Hey, did you complete this project I told you about last month?"" She NEVER tells me about these projects before they're due. At first, I'd thought I'd just forgotten, but I consider myself to be a pretty decent organizer/planner, and after the fourth or fifth time this happened, I assumed that I wasn't to blame. 

Some of my co-workers have started calling/messaging me whenever they have questions, which is fine; I've made it clear to them that they can. But everyone in my department has been working here significantly longer than I have, so I'm just confused why I seem to know more about our agency than they do.

I was looking to leave my job before the world started falling apart. If things ever go back to normal, I'm outta here. 

This is the first ""real"" job I've ever had, and I just want to know: is this level of disorganization normal in many work companies? 

**TLDR: Just read the title.**"

Do other people in corporate America not do anything?,"I work for a large company. I believe that at the corporate level everyone makes really (in most cases REALLY) good money. But it always seems like many people arent doing much. Just kind of finding ways to get through the day. There are some days I do absolutely nothing. There are some days where I'm on a lot of calls but I'm not doing much. Lots of layers to get through and it makes a simple process change take months to go through. Is this unique or is this pretty much everyone else in corporate gigs? I have some friends say their jobs are the same, but not sure if that's anecdotal or prevalent."
I feel like im terrible at my job,"I started my current position with a new company about 4months ago and ive been constantly feeling like i actually suck at what i do here. 

I seem to be making messes for my colleagues to clean up regularly and even though none of them or any of my managers have said a thing about it. Some of my colleagues also appear to be extra helpful and always checking on me, i cant tell whether they are simply worried about the quality of my work.

Before this position i was working for another company within the same industry (it being very unique and small in nature) only much more stressful and demanding in terms of skills and knowledge and i nailed it perfectly, however since i started here i couldnt feel a single sense of achievement and have been missing my old work constantly. Literally the only time i was happy was when something went wrong (out of my control) and i was able to spot the issue, intervened and fixed it properly using all my experience and knowledge built up from my previous job.

So guys, any idead what i should do? I cant quit just yet because of both personal and financial reasons and i really would like to stay here for at least 1year. How can i be better at it?"
How to address being taken advantage of at work?,"I've been the night supervisor at this company for little over two years now averaging 38 hours a week working from 6pm-6:30am three days a week back to back. During my work I am the only person in the building. When I was hired I was told I would only have to do Five things and Five things only but now my list of nightly duties has increased to well over twenty things because people quit and management fired others and didn't bother to hire people to replace them. There hasn't been a single week I've worked there where we weren't understaffed. Also keep in mind these task they have me do take at least a hour to do one of which must be done every hour on the hour or els it wont get done. When I am unable to finish the task management talk down to me like I'm a kid who just wrote on the walls, saying oh you should have told us you cant finish it and I just stare at them like you know I cant finish all this by myself. Now to the recent stuff because of the Covid-19 pandemic the government issued grants to businesses to pay their employees since companies would take a financial hit, so now because of this grant even if the employee doesn't work they would be getting paid well for two week that how I was getting paid without having to work it was like a paid vacation but now a coworker quit because management has become even more insufferable and they gilt tripped me into working now the hours they have me working is clocking in at two hours more than my normal hours and I figured I would be getting paid extra since I'm not working my normal hours, and I'm working when I legally and morally don't have an obligation to do so since they received free money from the government to pay me they don't lose me as an employee by me finding another job during this pandemic. Also in case this matter I make only a $1.50 more than minimum wage and this company could easily afford to increase wages for all employee also they offer no benefits what so ever which really could be of use considering risk of injury at this job is high an if the injury calls for medical attention which most cases it does they send you to the free clinic that is a mile away with their personal credit card.How do I go about this? What do I do? I honestly need help. I don't have the financial security to quit. Any help will be appreciated."
Is there an online community discussing and comparing big corporation's cultures?,"About a year ago I joined a company – one of the really big names in a really good industry – as an engineer in an apprentice middle management position, and I discovered that, frankly, there does not seem to be a lot of competent people over there except for the lowest tier of management and their blue collar subordinates. The chaos and lack of competence is not even the people’s own fault, because the organization is obsessing over all kinds of things except real productivity, retaining their experienced employees, and training the new ones. One thing in particular is costing them a lot of money and even more so consuming a hell of a lot of time of all individuals throughout the organization.

While I get a good salary for a stable job that’s not demanding at all, there is no fun in having one of the more useless positions in a company that has a lot of fat to trim, and I wish I could have known more about company culture in advance of applying for the job. I understand that in every company there will always be some corporate bullshit to deal with, but I heard from experienced colleagues that this is one of the more absurd companies, so in a few years I’d like to find myself an environment that is frankly just more fulfilling to work in. I wonder therefore if there is a good forum somewhere where people discuss the management culture in the companies they(’ve) work(ed) for?"
"Company created my position last year, now hiring a duplicate?","Has anyone been in a situation where they were still relatively new to a company, and the employer hired essentially your clone?

They told us to just call places and sell, but one of my main questions is how do I do that? how do I know who to talk to when I'm just calling a businesses number and talking to a sales associate, I work on commission so this is a little hard for me since I make no hourly money. if anyone could give advice on how to sell to the proper person in a business or just advice in general that would be great.

Potential Scam Company?,"I've been in contact and training with a company called ""Globe Logistics Co"" based allegedly out of Swizterland for a Project Management position.They are having me complete a four week training course which is ludicrously easy. It's entirely definitions based and open notes to the material which I have been sent that week.  They have what appears to be a real [website](http://globelogisticsco.com), but I cant find any other news about them in a basic google search. The website references many other offices across Europe and to doing operations all over the world. Including their new hiring going on for the US. 

When I was contacted by their ""Swiss HQ"" the number was from Khazakstan, and they claimed that must just be where their international calls get directed through.

The straw that finally broke the camel's back for me was they enlisted me to begin ""part-time"" work for them by acquiring equipment to be used in their soon to be opened asian office. They want me to figure out how much the electronics will cost. (Specifically Apple products, computers, scanners, printers.) Then they will allegedly provide the money for me to then buy said products on my own credit card.

Has anybody else talked to this company/worked with this company? Theres a lot of little things that have added up to me questioning their legitimacy. 

Tl;dr ""Company"" is putting me through an insanely easy training program and a series of red flags have led me to believe this is a scam, but I am unsure and could use some outside input."

"Lots of negative glassdoor reviews, should I be concerned? Has anyone had a positive experience with a company with a lot of bad reviews?","They all cite similar things, sound like different people, and HR has clearly put up one or two positive reviews but it's overall negative. Like, one star reviews negative. It's weird to me because you think HR would put up more fake reviews. However despite this, I already went to the training and recently started this job. 

I'm thinking a few things. I think a lot of what these people are saying is *true* but that doesn't really mean it's a bad company if that makes sense. As in, this is a retail-type position so there's inherently always going to be a lot of negative reviews right? On top of that this company only recently entered the market in my country so there's going to be some growing pains in terms of management and organizational structure. I'm wondering if these reviews might be a mix of lack of voice from the positive employee experiences (because they're newer) and maybe fake reviews from competitors astroturfing mixed in because they're a threat to their market. I know they might mostly be real reviews but I'm hoping it's mainly lot of people who just weren't suited for retail. Like I've worked at McDonald's and some other retail stores and it's not as bad as a lot of my coworkers would complain about it. It seems like some people are just not cut out for retail and retail nets a lot of people who are likely to have a bad experience. Sometimes the work experience can be really dependent on the specific team too. I just looked up one of the companies I've recently worked for and it has a much higher rating than I'd expect judging on how rough the store was (it's probably the only retail experience where I genuinely thought it was bad). I might just be doing a bunch of mental gymnastics though here to justify my choice to work here.

I'm just kind of scared and looking for advice or positive experiences if anyone has any to share. It's my first time working in the role I have and there's more responsibility on me than I've had in previous jobs. It's very attractive in terms of benefits and pay, and I think it'll look good on my resume due to the title although it's not at all related to my degree. I just wanted a stable job like this because I've been unemployed for months. There's so many negative reviews online but the team we have seems to be alright. Yes, there is almost constantly work that needs to be done and the hours are crazy right now but it's not *a bunch of one star reviews* bad imo. Then again I've only been here for less than a week. What do you think? Do you think I'm deluding myself or there's some truth to what I'm saying? Any experiences thriving from demanding retail jobs that looked less than attractive after college?"
How much should I charge?,"I will be managing the Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin and other social media accounts for a company. How much should I charge and how often? I have a lot of experience with social media but this will be my first time running a companies social media accounts."
President of company publicly posting about future flipping of company. Faux pas?,"The current (new) president of the company I work at posted on his LinkedIn that he has future plans to sell off the company. N.B., the post isn’t viable to the general public, just those within his LinkedIn network.  

Is this a red flag/business faux pas? As in, sharing private company information semi-publicly? I’m getting kind of nervous here that a president of a company would be so lax sharing this info online."
How to handle conversations about former toxic workplace?,"I left an extremely toxic workplace after 3 years. It was poorly managed, the employees (only 5 in the entire company) were not qualified for their jobs, high turnover rate (I had 4 managers in 2.5 years), constant gossip and drama to undermine and bully employees, I  never got a raise despite doubling my workload and got paid less than what was listed on government documents (didn't realize this till after I quit), etc. 

I found a much better job in the same city and the field is small enough that my former workplace still comes up in conversation with colleagues. Despite my strong feelings about my former company, I have always remained neutral and stay silent whenever it comes up.

My problem is some colleagues want to get involved there and I know they could be more successful elsewhere due to the toxic environment, poor management and lack of correct field knowledge (some colleagues hear stories of my former workplace from other sources and are in shock of how horribly run it is). 

TLDR: Left a horribly toxic workplace, the company still comes up in conversation with colleagues and some are interested in getting involved there. Nothing has changed at that company (if anything it has gotten more out of control) since I quit. Is there a way to politely warn my colleagues or steer them away from my former workplace so they don't waste their time?"
Has anyone heard of companies where the culture was loving? A place where people were supportive and caring for each other?,"The post title may sound weird. However, I'm currently in the job search, and my only criteria is that the company have a positive, loving culture.

For the last 9 years I've worked in NYC at companies where the culture is very competitive, very alpha male, and I've learned to really value work quality and excellence. However, the downside is that these environments have been extremely toxic. Mistakes are met with derision. Low performers are discarded instead of coached. The stressful environment comes home into my personal life.

For a small time period at my last job, I worked with a manager who was an exception to the culture. In one-on-one meetings he was very supportive and encouraging. He was always happy to complement my work in front of others. Because of him, I was motivated to do good work and in turn I wanted to support him.

Has anyone heard of companies that have loving cultures? Cultures where people are kind and caring. Or any tips on finding such a place?

Thanks!"

Feeling pretty confident about my job and my work ethic, and I know my value to the company will only begin to shine as I get into the groove of things.

&#x200B;

This evening we had a small meeting with our team, and my boss jokingly said that ""we don't believe in sick days here"". That honestly was upsetting to hear. I though I was hired onto an innovative and forward thinking company, however I am starting to sense the corporate ego and pride of working 12 hour days and not taking sick leave seep out.

&#x200B;

As much as I am a go-getter and have ambitions I want to achieve - in due time, this kind of mentality is not in line with my philosophy of how I want to live my life. Nothing is going to stop me from taking a sick day when its warranted, and I will certainly put in the hours when they are needed, but I also fundamentally believe in a work-life balance for a healthy sustainable life.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What are your opinions on this grind mentality?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: Couple people bringing it up as though it was a joke, which it was said in a jokingly manner - however, the context of the conversation was revolving around ""hard work, long hours, and self sacrifice to make it in the industry"". So I believe it was a joke with an undertone of expectation that unless you are killing yourself working then you're not going to be as valued as the folks who do. And honestly, I'm not gonna give up my gym, morning cycling, or cooking dinner time just to prove to other people that ""I am worth it""."
Why is my company “suggesting” us to take a day off on Easter Monday?,"Hi all,

I work in a large publicly traded media agency and we’ve received an email from our global ceo who suggested us to take a vacation day on Easter Monday. So we already have Friday off as a stat holiday but they’re suggesting we take the Monday off as well (using our own vacation day). Today we had a team meeting and my director mentioned that the reason for that is for “book keeping” and that publicly traded companies typically do these things to put them in a better financial position and without actually having to pay people off? They’re saying that if we all take a bit of sacrifice this will all be better for us in the long run..

Does anyone understand this at all? I am super confused on the reasoning but there seems to be a an underlying business strategy they are doing to protect the company? Someone please explain! :/ 

Thanks :)"
New job isn't going great,"Hey all,

 
Started my current job in November and was given an excellent description of the commission scheme, sales structure and how to really succeed as an outbound sales rep.

 
A week after my start date all the above was announced to be restructured for all colleagues as of January 1st. 
 

Previously we would receive commission on all units sold/hired and would even share commission/points with other sales reps from the supplying branch if we send out the quote.

 
They’ve now changed it to require us to hit 60% of a target to receive any commission at all. If I get 59% I get £0. If I get 61%, I will receive 61% of my commission. If I was due to receive £1000 in commission, I will get £610 for that month. This would be fine as it drives people to work harder…

 
However,

 
We work in regions by postcode/zip codes. I manage 6 very busy areas of the UK surrounding London and was told are “prime areas that generate a lot of revenue”.
For some reason that is beyond me; the company has now started to assign accounts as a single point of contact. Meaning that somebody in Scotland can be managing an account in Wales. The product will come from the Wales depo but all communication will be to the Scottish sales rep and will randomly throw these around however they see fit. 
 

Now on top of that they also allow sales people in our head office to manage ANY AREA of the country and get dibs on new accounts for the first 3 months (even if I have generated the business). So, if a customer is 5 minutes from our depo, the sales person at head office who does not know the area, do not know the customer, do not have free range of selecting prices will be able to STEAL OUR SALES. Freely. No real restrictions to it. Even if I have done all the leg work to win that contract. 
 

I’ve worked in sales for a number of years and I’m all for a bit of competition, but I’ve never experienced such blatant neglect towards the sales people putting in the effort with customer to generate new business. So long as the bosses get units out. 
 

Opinions?"
"Employer is very interested in me, but has a hiring freeze until mid Feb. What does this mean and what should I do?","I’ve had several rather informal interviews for a dream position with a dream company in the entertainment industry. 


The person interviewing me is an acquaintance of mine and he’s been very transparent and informal about the process. I’m now the only person being considered for this role, I’d be working directly under this acquaintance of mine, and he has given me every reason to believe they plan to hire me. Although I am still young and likely naive to these situations, he has said they are “very interested” in bringing me on to the team. 


The only issue is they have a hiring freeze in place until Feb 15th. The company has experienced massive growth over the last few years and they’re currently restructuring the department I’d work in. I haven’t been given any information on what the hiring freeze actually means for me.


My question is: Is this a red flag? What does a hiring freeze imply about the state of the company (from everything I’ve researched, other than the freeze, they seem to be doing exceptionally well)? Should I just continue to move on and apply for other jobs?"
Why do companies keep job postings open for so long?,"For example what would be the purpose in keeping an advert up for several weeks or even months?

Let’s say you had a strong candidate apply in the first 1-2 weeks, if you keep the process open for several weeks or months then you risk losing that person.

Why do companies keep and repost positions for weeks or months?

Is it to get a large or strong enough pool to choose from?

To reach a certain applicant count?

Or have they simply not found what they were looking for? Hence they keep the position open until they get the unicorn or perfect resume."
How would you feel if your current job tracks and records every mistake you make?,"So my job is implementing a system where essentially every mistake you make will be recorded and tracked. It is (allegedly) supposed to help correct errors and hold people accountable for their mistakes, but I can't help but feel somewhat uncomfortable about this whole idea. We already have issues with micromanagement at my job and this just feels like it will further exasperate the issue.

How would you feel if you're job did this? Or have you worked at a job that did this and how did it turn out?"
Should I work with Aerotek?,"Hey everyone I just had a few things on my mind and wanted to get advice. The main question is, should I continue to work with Aerotek as a staffing agency? I have read reviews talking about how terrible of a company they are and I was trying to come to a determination of if I should. I have already worked with them and within a few days of that, they set me up in with an interview and I actually got the job that I won’t start until next month. But with all these negative reviews, I’ve been wondering if it really is a good idea to continue to work with them. 

Side note: the reviews I’ve been reading was pretty old and I have read a few good reviews."
Do most people who go into warehouse start on night shift?,Are days usually reserved for people with seniority or experience?
"Is ""working lean"" just a euphemism for we'll overwork and underpay you?","My current employer is big on ""working lean"". Literally every single person in the working level is swamped with work and pressure from customers. Positions are open and candidates are being interviewed, but the ""leadership"" is taking its own sweet time making decisions and asking for yet another resource estimate.

At this point, everyone is doing the job of at least 2 people and the management espouses the philosophy of working lean. I think going forward, I'll avoid any company who mentions this as part of their pitch during the interview process. Is this the same for everyone?"
What to do when there's no assignments,"I'm a web/graphic designer at my job and the work load is pretty low for me. I ask my supervisors for tasks or anything I can help them with and when they do have a task I finish it before the 8 hours are up. 
I would browse the internet but most non-work related websites are blocked. I feel lazy when I have nothing to do or like I'm doing something wrong by not having work to do. Is this normal for my position?"
Are 2020 Census jobs worth applying for?,Are they just basically all temp jobs as well do they pay anything well enough to do it? I see it all over my city but I’m wondering what’s the experience working for one
Jobs that keep the job description vague,"It seems like a lot of job postings now a days indicate that they can ask you to do pretty much anything and you would have to do it. "" Performing other tasks as needed"" ""Ad Hoc"" etc. why is it like this? This only leaves room for the employer to over work the employee without any pay raise etc. 

Also a lot of jobs are just keeping the job description as vague as possible so they can throw anything at you at anytime with no room to say no to the task"
"Has anyone experienced a real, significant culture change at their job that wasn't based on massive firing?","It's heard all the time how places need a culture change so a new boss comes in, who usually doesn't know the business, changes stuff, makes a mess, then leaves, and the place is still in bad or worse shape. A lot of good people who have marketable skills leave because they don't need to tolerate it. The voids are filled by more bad people.

 Short of a place completely cleaning house and firing everyone and starting fresh, has anyone experienced a a success story? A positive, lasting good culture change? Something that made you want to stay?"
Have you ever fallen in love with a job you thought you would hate?,"I started a new job last week but I'm already wondering if it's the right place for me... I can pinpoint the little things that bother me, but none are worth quitting over. I will say it is different from the jobs I've had in the past, which might be why I feel a little off... 

Has anyone ever been in a similar position? Some people say by the end of the first week, you ""know"". Others say you need to give it at least 3-6 months. Any insight at all would be appreciated!"
What should I actively be doing in my job to ensure I keep it?,"Hello, long story short. I was dismissed from my first ever job. They deemed my progress to slow but I was never given any warning and prior to this in my last meeting I was told I was doing a great job. And my team member said they would’ve liked for me to have been kept on and said they were happy with the work I was doing. 

I’ve managed to secure a second job now but now I’m very anxious because I gave it my all in my first job and still got the sack and completely blindsided me. Now I’m so worried the same thing will happen again. If i was incompetent then in a way I would be happier because I know what I have to fix but now I’m just nervous because I gave my 100% and it still wasn’t enough. I just don’t want to work and be constantly nervous about my job security. 

Has anyone got any advice?"
HR says I can't return because I didn't submit my timesheets, I've done two contracts for this company with the most recent one ending in November. While there I had a bad habit of not submitting one of the two time sheets that we were required to submit each week. One was for the company I worked for and the other for the client. Needless to say my supervisor wants me back and the recruiter I've been speaking to says I have a clean work record with their client company so the problem is just the on-site HR person that is saying no due to the timesheet. I guess maybe she thinks I stole money?
"I have 2 jobs, one company just bought the other. What should I do?","So as the title suggests, I have been working for my new company for a little over 4 months. We just got bought by the company I put on the back burner but am still an active employee at. I'm not sure if I should quit one because I never found out if there would be a conflict of interest with me working this other job or not.

The company I just started working for pays me more but I'm thinking that the old company that bought us will take over and my pay will be reduced based on that depending on which company I'm working for (if I continue working for company 1 my pay might become lower within company 2, unless I quit company 1). What should I do?"

"Places where other young adults work? (Stores, Fast food, Shopping malls, etc)","So my seasonal job is ending soon, and Im trying to find a new place. Im in community college, So I can only work less than 40 hours a week.

Im trying to find a job where other young adults/teens work. I like working with older adults...but its just different when I could work with someone my own age. I just get along with them better.

Odd job listings in Chicago?,"I’m not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but I’m not sure where else to post. I have recently been applying for entry level marketing and editing positions in Chicago. Two companies I have heard back from are called Arrow & Atlas and Balance & Buzz.  Both companies emailed me in a similar fashion for a similar marketing assistant position. When I look on Glassdoor, there is nothing for either business. When I looked up the recruiters names on LinkedIn, I get nothing. There are websites for both, but they are vague at best. There is no other information on them except for these websites. Still, when I email with these companies, I’m talking to a real person who answers my questions. Is this a scam, or am I just paranoid?"
"How is it like working for Amazon, Google and Microsoft?","Genuinely curious because one of my cousins got into Amazon and she is having an extremely difficult time with no trainings at all. She is getting pressurised on a daily basis having insinuations of getting fired if she doesn't ramp up quickly. Her work also depends on quite a few people who has no trust in her since she is new. I really believed these companies are a good place to work, but I guess I am wrong? Anyone can shed a light on this?"
What are ways to identify toxic work environments ahead of time? Dealing with a toxic work environment right now...,"I am currently going through a difficult time at my work. It is the end of the fiscal year and because we recently had a leadership change at the company, the new executives are changing our entire sales structure. I work in Sales Operations and so my job is to implement these changes. Well, they took their sweet time getting the requirements to me and kept changing things. I was also not involved in the discovery conversations, so it was hard having to get everything second hand from my manager. On top of that, my boss has started micromanaging me and is now making me work over the weekend in a passive aggressive way because otherwise these projects won't get done in time. Unfortunately, I have a much better relationship with my Director, but there is still middle management in between. 

Furthermore, I have realized over the 7 months I have worked at this company that there is a disconnect between what they say and what they do. They praise work-life balance and say they value their employees, but then I get in trouble for taking a lunch and am shamed into working overtime. The office environment is really awkward in my opinion because you either just say ""how's it going"" or you avoid eye contact when you pass each other. Socializing or having conversations seems to be frowned upon. Needless to say it is not a good work environment for me. 

Maybe my problem is with my manager or maybe it's with both my manager and the company, but I'm starting to feel like this job isn't what it seemed to be when I started. They have a great Glassdoor rating (4.6) and everything they talked about in the interview was great. They didn't lie to me or anything, but I do think that they painted a better picture than what is reality. I also think that HR does a lot of things just for the optics.

I am considering starting to look at new opportunities, but I'm also worried that I will just end up working at another company that has a toxic work environment. Today, I read this article on LinkedIn (A Toxic Work Culture Is Forcing High-Performing People to Quit
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/toxic-work-culture-forcing-high-performing-people-quit-tim-denning) and a lot of it applies to what I'm currently going through. 

What are effective ways to identify a toxic work environment before you start working there? Is it even possible? Am I hoping in vain for a better work environment and just need to accept that this is how corporate America works? Any advice or recommendations are welcome. I'd also be happy to hear about your experience dealing with a toxic work environment. I am planning on talking to my boss about my issues in the hopes of resolving some of these problems. We'll see how that goes."
Question about calling in absent,"So I’m trying to call in and say that I won’t be able to come in today. I have called 3 times and none have been answered, I even texted as per protocol just incase they can’t answer. I have left a voicemail. Should I just let it be and not show up? Or am I overreacting."
Liberty National,So I started working at liberty national and am going through the training process right now. Does anyone have any inside info on this place. Like am I safe? Should I be concerned? I’ll be starting as a Supervising Agent so I’ll have people below me and not exactly entry level but a little above.
Why do so many companies ghost you after applying?,"One thing I dislike about work and applying for jobs in general is how if you get rejected, you either don’t hear back and have to figure that out on your own, or if you are, you won’t hear back for MONTHS sometimes. Keep in mind that looking for a job in some cases is a job in itself, and I wish companies at least were a little more time sensitive because of that. Hell, I also wish that they at least gave you a reason why you didn’t get the job instead of letting you ruminate over the potential causes. I understand that I’m likely being overly naive and idealistic, but getting a job (or rather, getting a GOOD job) is tough. And yes, I understand that it’s a two way street: potential employees should follow up, since HR and recruiting can be a mess...but still. I just wish this whole process was a little more compassionate."
Any recommendations for interviewing with a startup?,"I have an interview soon for a fintech that was founded  in 2019. The pay is decent and similar role as my previous job.

Question about PTO?,"Hello, 
My company is running tight on work for everyone and so now to get your guaranteed hours, you would work Sunday-Saturdaly. If they ask you to work on Saturday (by having a day off during the week)  and you decline., you are not able to use your PTO to get paid for hours you are short by. Is the company allowed to deny us using PTO like that?

Appreciate the feedback!"
"I'm at a great place now, but scared.","After years of working a list of jobs in my life, I have nailed a seasonal position that is awesome and a dream I've had to work for the company. It is seasonal, but I am hoping to stay on after the season is over. Here's my problem though. My fears. I have never had a hard time doing customer service. In fact, I have been so good at customer service that I have been a go to person because I am so extroverted and friendly. My customer service comes from my empathy and being able to understand where people come from and never trying to rip them off or do anything untrustworthy. I have had countless people tell me to my face how good I do and how much they appreciate me, some even writing letters and telling previous bosses how I was the only reason they come to the business. But, then there is the other end of the dream, the nightmare. Every place I have ever gone there are bosses or employees who hate me. No matter how hard I work or what I do, they always find ways to get rid of me. And I know it's my personality. I have spent so many times in rooms, just numb as some supervisor tells me I just am not a fit for their company and they have to part ways. I always leave the room just dumbfounded. I am always on time, even early, I always make the customer happy, I sell and make goals, I go beyond and above, yet it never is enough. But, the person who doesn't make an effort and lacks social skills will be always put on the work schedule and given the hours and will never be in trouble. Is being outgoing and friendly a threat to my fellow employees. Am I some sort of target because I must stick out due to my customer service. I want to continue working, but I don't want to keep getting fired over and over again. Has anyone else who is outgoing come across this?

&#x200B;

TL;DR-Customers love me, employers hate me. Am I too eager and outgoing?"
How does the “training period” work within the US ?,"So I’m currently a college freshman and a friend of mine who resides within the UK told me about how he had an 3 month “testing period” and how he got the job but the friend who came with him didn’t and got fired. So I wondered how this would work within the US when I apply and got a position on say something like Amazon.  (The company he now works for is apparently a major one, on the same levels as Apple, Google etc)."
Why are people expected to work their way up in corporate jobs?,"I've been working in service jobs for most of my life and there wasn't a concept of upward mobility. In my old workplace, my boss was upset with me because I didn't ask her for more opportunities. I wasn't aware I supposed to be asking for more work and I was happy with what I was doing. Is there a position or job in a white-collar environment where I can do what I signed up for and not have my task/title changed?"
Advice for current job?,"I currently work at floater administrative assistant job. I go to whichever site needs coverage in case someone their calls out or I’m just an extra. Right now I’m a full time floater so if I’m not covering for someone I’m just at a site for extra coverage just in case. My bosses know of my severe asthma that acts up with even the slightest trigger and at first understood why I would have to call out because once again I’m in urgent care due to me not being able to breathe. Lately they’ve been more off putting and were short with me when I told them hours I’m advance I couldn’t come to a site to cover two weeks ago. The site that needed coverage had 2 of us scheduled to cover for an odd reason I’m not sure of. So I thought it shouldn’t be bad that I called out since the other person is trained to work there as well. But when I told them I had to call out, my boss texted me to say it affects the site when I call out when they need coverage. The response made it seem like I’ve been calling out every time someone needs coverage which isn’t the case. I’d be feeling sick but would still work to cover for someone until I know there’s a day I can call off and be ok with Because I’m not covering for someone. He told me we need to talk about me calling out and I understand I would want to talk as well to an employee if they had been consistently calling out. I told him we could talk the day of and he never replied to me. Then days later had me scheduled to a site I told him wouldn’t work because it’s too far away and not near a metro accessible stop which I told them in advance that I can only work at locations that are near train stations/bus stops. Then I also have to take my sister to school in the morning so he knows what my mornings are like and which sites I can not attend to. I asked him can I be at another site instead and he only replied with that i could go in late to the site he wanted me at and I’ll just have reduced hours and no lunch. Then he starts nitpicking at my dress attire for work which is pretty causal. I’ve been dressing the same for this job at different sites for the past almost 2 years and not once have I gotten a complaint or anything but all of a sudden he’s complaining about my dress code which is mainly black jeans and a blouse or a nice shirt and dress pants and always nice dress shoes. He’s starting to nitpick with everything now and I don’t know if I’m looking too hard into it. I just needed advice on what to do?"
No diversity in workplace?,"I’m south Asian. I live in the south. Maybe it’s just the companies I work at but I’ve noticed that there are rarely any Asians or south Asians where I am. If there are it’s few in between. Also there’s barely any Hispanics in corporate jobs either.

Is preHIRED legit?,"Hass anybody heard of this company? They have a fair bit of reviews in many places that I deem worthy such a sales hacker. Their marketing at least on Facebook seems very transparent. If you complete the course on the income based repayment they will only enforce repayment if you make $60,000 OTE ormore with a base of at least 40,000. The total cost is $30,000 if you paid back at 12.5 percent of your income every month for 48 months. Faster if your income is higher than the 60,000 OTE.

I feel like this might be a pretty good idea especially for people making a fair bit less than 60,000 OTE and or people looking to break into the software business. but before I go blindly recommending them even though they have a lot of good reviews video reviews and a pretty good following in a lot of places I want to get feedback first."

Common for Companies to Hold on Hiring This Time of Year?,"I'm currently a temp at a position where my initial contract that ends at the end of the calendar year. It's a job that pays very little but gets me some income versus none, meanwhile I found a job that pays double of what I'm being paid hourly here and went through 4-weeks of consisting of numerous interviews down to the last one where HR and my hiring manager said I'm *in great standing* and they would update me after my background check passes (HR says this was the last step. I went in for many separate on-site interviews with everyone from manager, HR, team members, and even the CEO.

I received an e-mail from my hiring manager saying that everyone I interviewed with loved me and believe I will excel in this position for their company, ***however*** **due to upcoming holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmastime  Company X is putting a hold on hiring.** They went on to say that the position will be open again in 2020 and would love to reach out to me if I'm still interested.

Is this a common practice for many companies, or is this another way to say ""Sorry, we don't want you but will keep your resume on file"". Additional detail from the company is that they told me employees get the entire week off at the end of December, could that be an additional factor? (Funny the HR guy joked with me saying that they are pretty in need of this position filled and if I get it I could benefit from the holiday time off soon)

Do companies usually start hiring at the start of the new calendar year, Jan 2020?

Lastly, this is something that I know you guys probably can't answer (and I e-mailed my manager to confirm an hour after getting the e-mail, no reply yet), but would they re-start the hiring process with a new batch of candidates and sprinkle me in? Or do you think they'll likely just continue where they left off? I didn't specifically ask if ""I was hired but just waiting til company lets them hire again"" but wondered if I need to go through another grueling month of not knowing and interviewing once again...what would it even be like to talk to the same people again??

I feel dejected to receive this e-mail even though I know I should suck it up. I've been fortunate and this was my first time having such a long interviewing process. I hope I get a clear answer."
Considered for employment just because I can translate,"So this business hired me because I can translate both English and Spanish. As soon as I got a call from one of the supervisors, he said the name of a company everyone is aware of: World Financial Group. It’s a company associated with Transamerica and Primerica, which recruits people into making them recruit other people in hopes they get even more people and etc. reviews have said that they scam people out of $100 ($500 depending on state) into putting money for their training and other packages. They also request credit and debit card info, SSN, and birthdays. So here’s my question, should I consider it or be aware of their business practices?

Edit: there’s a video on WFG. You should check out AlwaysMarco. He pretends to be interested to exploit them of their pyramid schemes"
Why is management shirking responsibilities?,"So lately I've become more involved in the training, safety, and quality side of my worksite, and I've noticed that pretty much across the board my local management and seemingly also the HQ management for my segment (business unit) have ignored major portions of several management systems. These management systems have complete guidance documents and clear standards, plus mountains of supporting documentation...so why is management failing to implement these systems?

Just wondering if anyone has any insight on what causes such neglect?"
How can I politely but firmly ask my supervisor for my shifts back?,"I  got hired for this security job back in January. I go to school Monday  and Wednesday. They were able to work with my schedule and give me  shifts on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I love it bc I sit at a lobby  desk, not a lot happens so I can study which is great. As of about a  month ago, it appears they hired too many people and so my Tuesday day  was cut. To make it more irritating, the guy who my shifts were given to  showed up an hour late one day and one supervisor said he has been a  headache but for some reason he still gets my shifts? So I emailed the  senior supervisor saying my usual schedule of Tuesday, Thursday and  Friday was working really well with my school schedule and I asked if  there was any way I could keep doing that schedule. He replied saying we  are finally fully staffed and that the only days he can guarantee me  are Thursday and Friday. On Friday I replied back to him asking ""Is  there a particular reason I am being kicked off this Tuesday shift?""  followed with ""I don't understand why someone new appears to have gotten  precedence for this shift over me"". It looks like he heeded my  frustration because Monday around noon I get a text from them saying  they have scheduled me for my usual shift on Tuesday. Awesome I thought -  But when I got to the site and looked at the schedule, sure enough  ""headache"" guy was given my usual shift for the following week. I'm  kinda pissed off about it. I plan to email him again about it tomorrow.  Something along the lines of:

""Hi  supervisor, I appreciate you putting my back on x site for Tuesday.  However I noticed I wasn't on it for next week. I have been doing a good  job at this shift/site for the past 6 months. Am I to understand that  this new guy gets to show up, take my shift, while I'm supposed to just  roll over and be ok with it? Because I'm really not...""

Good or too much?"
Has anyone here successfully asked for their (or another) job back after leaving?,"I left a company I semi built for another opportunity that turned out to be a bad fit and I left. I tried really hard to leave the first co on good terms and obviously had a lot of seniority and a hand in their success. But I think there were some hurt feelings there although not overt hostility. It's now been months, I'm unemployed and my husband just lost his job. I think they might not fill my old role, but could potentially use me in another way. It just feels so awkward and weird to approach and I can't imagine it working out. Has anyone done this? How did you do it?"
Is it unprofessional to have long hair in the work place?,"I’m starting at a new place on Monday & was wondering. I have long hair, I’m a female. It’s past my breast area & when I straighten it it’s even longer. People have told me I should tie it up. But I’m thinking if I should get a trim atleast to my shoulder area so I can be professional while still wearing my hair down. 

My workplace is pretty casual. But of course we can’t have anything too out there (funny hair colors, too many tattoos). I’m sure they don’t care about my piercings. But this hair thing bothers me & I was thinking with my first paycheck I should get a hair cut. 

Thanks 😊"
"Switched shifts for a coworker and she didn’t show up for my shift, what to do?","This girl is a headache to work with. First, she didn’t tell my manager that she switched with me. So I had to apologize to my manager for that as he seemed annoyed already. He said it was fine that we switched, just make sure she showed up to my shift.. and she didn’t. 

I already worked my shift from last night 11pm-7am and went back to work her shift (12n-7pm). My replacement came in fine. He texted me that he waited until midnight and the coworker I switched shifts with never came in. 

I’m honestly annoyed because she has made me look bad twice now... how should I approach this?

Taking a job at a think tank with political views you severely disagree with?,"I would just be the office manager, and the pay and benefits are really great.  I've been struggling to find a new job for months and this is the best prospect I've had yet.

However, I find the extreme nature of their views to be flat out comical (see below) and impossible to respect. Their blog posts often read like very jargon-y conspiracy theories and they repeatedly post climate change skepticism, which I find abhorrent.  I am also concerned it would be really hard to explain to future employers and would be a stain on my resume that would not be representative of who I am as a person or employee.  Is it worth it to take a job with an organization you hate and would be embarrassed to associated yourself with if you don't have a DIRECT hand in what they do and aren't 200% desperate for it?  I'm totally stumped.

TL;DR: Their organization is OBSESSED with the ultimate power of the unfettered free market and yet they are almost completely supported by donations. While I am very opinionated, I generally don't feel the need to express my political views at work but this would be A LOT to ignore."
"What trades job (plumber, electrician, mechanic, crane operator etc) has little exposure to dust/smoke.",My brother has asthma and is considering getting a trade but it seems many of them have much exposure to smoke/dust/ etc. and he has asthma and is not very tolerant of such things in the long term.

Anyone ever have a manager that never accepts blame?,"My manager keeps getting complaints from customers that call head office in regards to him telling them false information/going back on his word. He told a customer to meet him on wed which was his day off and the customer got mad at me and told me to tell my manager he sucks. That customer called head office and complained about my manager. We get into work tgis morning and he starys yelling at us saying its our fault we are telling the customer false information and that if we dont know whats going on to shut up.

I assume he told head office this as well since he doesnt like taking blame. He constantly throws us under the bus to other managers and even customers so they dont get mad at him. Not sure where to go at this point. I have called our regional manager in the past and she chewed him out but nothing happened and it has just made my life hell having to deal with him now. Is it worth going to the higher ups again? This company is incredible and i love my job its just he is the worst manager i have ever had."
Why do companies use staffing agencies to hire permanent full-time workers?,"Question as stated, what is the average amount a company pays a staffing agency in the event a candidate is hired, on top of whatever the candidate gets paid?

Just sorta seems to me that companies only 'see' candidates from staffing agencies as a method of getting a run of the field for people to interview, so they can severely lowball on salary for those not going through agencies...But I'm likely wrong here in some fashion.

Context : I'm going through a staffing agency for a coordinator position, company doesn't seem THAT large that they'd be particularly interested in paying salary + whatever cut the agency gets on top of that. I'm not taking it especially seriously, though - I've got other stuff going."
I quit my job because I couldn't keep (unknowingly) scamming people and I need to know if I have any (legal) course of action options to help this company stop what it's doing to innocent people?,"I quit my job a week ago when I got fed up with being lied to and my co-workers and I found out all the ""helpful"" products we were selling to innocent people turned out to be what I would call a ""scam"" but is really just deceitful- the Energy service ends up costing double the kWh, never sent the ""giftcards"", were putting people in debt- and the ""home automation"" service they just acquired touts itself as the ""number 1 in safety"" (I can't find evidence of this anywhere) that binds people into a 5 year contract in which they have to pay thousands of dollars to get out of; plus they do door-to-door sales and their product is one of the worst reviewed things I've ever seen.

 I quit because I couldn't sell these to people anymore, as well as the treatment of my managers towards me and my co-workers, (sexual harassment), and the fact that the company operates as a Pyramid Scheme in which you ""level up"" after training your team of newly-hired, fresh and naive college students to get a number of points (whether that means selling based on lies/cancellations or not) and then you eventually get promoted to ""Team Leader"", but not before being manipulated by the top people taking it away from you because you didn't show up to work 30 minutes early. Long story short, the ""promotions"" lead to nothing but more work.

THREE- yes THREE different ""trainers"" were arrested with FELONY CHARGES during the course of my 4-month stay with that company for selling fraudulent phones, etc. It sucks because literally everyone did fraud there, that was the ONLY way to get promoted and keep getting ""$1,000 paYchEckS"" every week.


I apologize for the rant but it was just terrible and I would like to know if anything can be done about this, what course of action I could take (besides the detailed, bad review I left, which is of course buried by the hundreds of fake, glowing reviews on Glassdoor). Please let me know, thank you."
Specific question concerning being a Seasonal Amazon Delivery Driver,"Hi, very specific question, but on Indeed Amazon has tons of job listings for a Seasonal Driver. These jobs claim to occur in many different nearby towns however (including mine). But if you click 'Apply' to any of them they all redirect you the exact same corporate website link stating this job occurs in a city 70 minutes away from me. So my question is this-is this just Amazon BS trying to tell me this job *has the potential to* go through my town but in any case I'll have to drive 70 mins to pick up the van? Because if so I'm not going to bother signing up. Thanks!"
Started new job & feeling so lost! Is this normal?,"I came from a company which is pretty easy but for the pretty easy work we only get paid 14 dollars. We never had any meetings daily or conference calls daily. Wasn’t really corporate. Just a basic desk job. 

I found a job through my best friend. She’s my trainer & my boss is awesome. We are part of a really small team in a pretty big company. It’s my second day and both my best friend & my boss said it’ll take a month to learn everything. But I have no clue how. The information. There’s so many little steps I have to remember. All these rules for different accounts. Ten accounts or more. I haven’t started training classes yet but I am sitting with my best friend & she’s showing me what she does and is giving me the training. I know it’s only the second day but I’m freaking out silently. Yes I’m taking notes and yes I’m listening into calls. But I feel useless because I’m not doing anything really. The information is sometimes confusing. There’s so many emails being sent out. Documents. Files. 

The office environment is great. People are super nice. Love the space. I am used to the office environment. And can deal with the rules (it’s more lax here) 

I’m just freaking out it’ll take me longer than a month to learn all this stuff.  I feel totally lost. My boss understands & so does my best friend but I still feel bad. 

Any advice? Stories? Help!"
Is it normal to want the work-life balance when job hunting?,"The reason why I ask is because I see myself dreading the concept of working 9-5(or 8-5) for 5 days a week, and that I see myself working for 3 days a week, 12 hours a day(or 10 hours depending on the job).

When did companies get so stingy?,"I recently got hired for a part time job. I'm scheduled for 20 hours a week. My boss comes up to my last pay period and says you have to be careful with your time, you went over by 15 minutes (for two weeks since we get paid bi weekly). He was nice about it, but I was just surprised this was such a big deal. This wasn't 15 minutes of over time mind you, this was 15 minutes on top of the 20 hours. This is not a mom and pop shop, this is a fortune 500 company. Has anyone encountered this? Are companies all like this now a days?"
Advice about CADC LLC,"I am looking for a job in political campaigns and have seen many job offers in indeed about CADC LLC, but reviews are contradictory.

Are these signs of a scam?,"Applied to a job and they got back to me rather quickly for an interview.

Couldn’t find anything else about them online either... no social media accounts, no reviews, no mentions.

"Managers or recruiters, why do you question someone’s “loyalty to the company” or bring up the “experience” card when they ask about pay?","I hear this all the time. Someone says hey I’m asking this much. Then the recruiter says “oh well I mean we can’t pay you this much but you’ll get experience or exposure”. I also hear about how when someone talks about their pay, their managers question whether that employee really care about the company or the loyalty.

Don’t get me wrong, exposure is definitely important for entry level positions. For fresh out of college especially. Maybe they DO need to take a lower paying job to get experience.

But for associate, mid level and higher, like why?

What do you think people come to work for? MAJORITY of the people don’t actually “care about the company”. They come to the work place for one reason and one reason only. To get paid. To make a living. That’s it. This isn’t some saving the whales or rain forest or Africa humanitarian job. People come to work and grind away for that $$$.

And for recruiters that use that “experience card”, experience doesn’t pay bills.

So why do you always ask these questions to try and guilt trip your employees or candidates?"
I'm feel like I'm underpaid and the only one who cares about working.,"Hi, this is my first post here, I hope I don't break any rules! 

My name is Phil and I have been a retail worker for a big company for the last 6 months. I am paid the minimum amount and working full time. I never really asked any questions because I am not very experienced with working yet (I am 19). People tell me I am good at my job, one of the best where I work and I'm glad. 

However, my new colleague told me that I am severly underpaid for the amount of work I do in the store. Basically I do most of the stuff myself and my other coworkers don't take the job seriously, using their phones while supposed to be working. My manager is always looking for new people to replace them, but very few people want to work there and my coworkers are using this at their advantage. I think am someone who is very loyal, which is why I didn't look for something else all that time. 

I am starting to slowly hate my job here because I do a lot alone. I hate the fact that other coworkers are paid way more than I am while doing almost nothing. I work 40 hours a week at 12$ an hour. 

With Black Friday and the Holidays coming up, I would feel bad quitting and I don't think it would be good for any future job, but showing up every morning and doing the job that wasn't done while I was gone is excruciating.

Chances of a permanent position within World Bank?,"Don't know if this sub is qualified to answer this question, but there seems to be a few 

I'm wondering about. I've read the position descriptions, policies and reviews. Apparently permanent positions are considered on a discretionary basis? 

Does anyone have any insights into how you get a ""permanent"" position at the World Bank? Does everyone start temporary, and then get offered a permanent gig on a discretionary basis? Do you need to be an exceptional performer? Indispensable to the org? Politics? (both ""small-p"" office politics, and ""big-p"" national politics?)

This is almost a theoretical consideration. If i did pursue this, it would be in around 5-10 years time, I would be applying as an Energy Specialist, since i'm adamant that it's where i want to focus my career.

I'm currently an energy economist at a central government agency (not US), working on some high-profile policy, governance, economic and finance issues.

Experience of Glassdoor reviews?,"I posted this to get the community's opinions on Glassdoor - esp. since I've had an inconsistent experience of using the site! How do you use Glassdoor?

My take: Take the reviews on Glassdoor with a grain of salt - the reviews you see are either fake reviews (as in employees coerced or enticed to give positive reviews) or people who are so pissed (either because they were fired or because they had a bad manager) that they leave a negative review which may not represent the organization as a whole.

My advice: Talk to people working in the organization, if possible. Use additional sources of information about the company like:

* Newspaper articles
* Google reviews/google searches
* Reports on the company's website like financial reports

My experience

* There was an MLM company that invited me to a job interview and it turns out that the company tends to invite unemployed people and sell them credit cards! Google reviews saved me on that one.
* A friend tried to recruit me into WFG - an MLM - [and the reviews on Glassdoor are great](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/World-Financial-Group-Reviews-E148185.htm)!
* I worked at an organization that sucked but the reviews were great because employees who had been in the organization for a long time were encouraged to write reviews. Unfortunately, new and younger employees had a very different experience of the company.
* I got a job offer from a great organization, but I was hesitant because of some negative reviews. Luckily a friend pointed out that the number of negative was less, so I should be careful on how I evaluate the company."
I despise Open Concept offices,"Can anyone relate? I left a job where I sat at a desk in a row of people for one in which i have my own cubicle, and my anxiety vanished.

Shared “confidential” information with VP of a department at my job for him to present at a company meeting. Am I overthinking?,"So, to make a long story short; the owner/CEO of our small company, sent me
PowerPoint slides that they told me the are confidential and that I shouldn’t share them with anyone. I just started at the company, and I’m in an entry level position. 

A few weeks ago, things were very hectic at work and we got a last minute call from the CEO to change the meeting rooms for a planned meeting they would would be presenting at, using the PowerPoint slides they sent me. So we just needed to get the info on the screen for the client that was coming in as quickly as possible. The VP of a department at our organisation asked if I could send him the slides to add to the deck, which he (the VP) would also be presenting from his laptop (so I had to send the slides to him). 

Does sharing the slides with the VP, considering that he 1) would be presenting them from his laptop and everyone knew and saw this, 2) wanted to make edits to it and 3) requested me to send them and is in a much higher level position, put me in the wrong since they’re “confidential”? 

Am I in the clear or just overthinking? When the CEO mentioned not giving the slides to anyone, I suppose they meant external customers/vendors; am I correct? I have a feeling it’s ok and I’m just overthinking, just want to make sure."

Being recruited after just starting new job,"I just started a new job in a new industry and role about 6 weeks ago. So far I am really liking the company, my team, my manager and the job itself. 

Out of no where, one of the people I met when I was job searching reached out to me about an open position. It pays around the same rate as I get now but with the potential for bonuses and I would work from home full time. It’s in the industry and role I previously left. I didn’t love the industry but it was mainly due to the company I had worked for in it. 

I really like the aspect of being able to work from home full time since that was something I’ve always wanted and would give me the flexibility to work on my side things. On the other hand, I’m currently in a role that’s teaching me great skills and new experiences that so far I’m enjoying.

Is $12 an hour a good starting salary offer?,"Hi I’m a recent college graduate with two bachelors degrees and a certification in business. i don’t have a ton of prior work experience, but I had a summer internship and a part time college job. I have been looking for work, and found a part time position at a hospital with a pay of $12 an hour, with the potential for a 4% increase after a year of work.
I’m not sure whether for my qualifications this is appropriate pay. I wanted $15 an hour so I’m a little disappointed. However it’s been difficult finding positions that will accept a new graduate. Should I accept the offer or is it not enough for the pay? I’m trying to gauge.

Extremely bad feelings about new job,"So it's been a little more than a week and I may sound like I'm complaining too much so early on but I have extremely bad feelings about my job. I just graduated as a finance major, and right before graduating I had major anxiety about finding a job in the first place. So I basically took what I could find.  The job that I took has nothing been awful from the start. First they tried to go against my vacation request even though they agreed to it previously. Secondly they surprised me by making me travel my first week of the job and all my managers bailed on me so I had to go on it alone and take care of the whole business trip myself. And lastly, the job is not what was described to me at all. I was described an extremely analytical position (position is called financial analyst) but it turns out that all the cool stuff in the interview that my manager told me I would get to work on is not happening. The reality is that I'm just doing manual data entry all day and there's no analysis to be done at all. I'm basically handling mail and physical papers and inputting it into a system. I'm really an individual looking to do mentally stimulating work. I want to learn but unfortunately I'm not learning a single thing at all. What would you do in this situation? Should I continue to give it another chance and just work? Or should I look for another job and keep this one off my CV as the experience is too short. Any advice would be most welcome, thank you all very much."
"Leave a company or stay during a ""transition"" period?","I moved a couple years ago with my family to come work for a mechanical design build contractor. Two years ago, the company was sold and moved from a family owned business to a private corporation. Shortly after, the original owner died. About a year ago, the owner's son left the company over a disagreement with the new corporation about how they're running the company.

Within the last two months, the owner's son has opened up his own business across the street doing the exact same type of work. He was one of the lead design engineers here, so not a big surprise. He has made it clear he intends to put us out of business. He has since taken with him the following people:

\-another head engineer

\-manpower supervisor

\-service group leaders

And there is already talk of several field employees/more office employees going with, most of them all with high knowledge of this field and our business.

My question is if it is worth sticking around at my company during this transition period. I have several other prospects I could look in to, but I'd like to stay and finish out my projects, about another 3-5 weeks.

My concern is if I do tender my 2 weeks resignation, their MO so far has been to walk people out on the spot. I am unsure if they are paid or not for the 2 weeks.

On top of that, my personal phone, laptop, and car are all currently through my employer, so if I left, that would be one of the conditions of my new employment.

Glassdoor listing has blatantly fake reviews and refuses to remove them.,"The company ""Red Label Enterprises"" (https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Red-Label-Enterprises-EI_IE1958975.11,32.htm) seems to be plagued with an abundance of great reviews, especially in the last two months. Here are some examples of language that has just been slightly reworded:

* Keep the focus on growing the team just as you have been. Investing your time into us is extremely appreciated.
* Keep investing your valuable time with us.
* Thank you for the mentorship!
* Thank you from the bottom of my heart for ALL that you've done and continue to do.
* Keep coaching and thank you for the mentorship.
* Thank you for being so inspiring.
* Keep mentoring people and coaching the way you do. Thanks for always being there for us no matter what time of day
* Keep up the great work and THANK YOU for EVERYTHING you do for us!!
* Keep up the great work!!
* Keep doing what you're doing. Don't change a thing!!
* Don't ever lose your fire!
* Please keep on doing EXACTLY what you're doing!!
* Please don't change a darn thing!!

There are so many more examples. This ""marketing"" company seems to be preying on college students. Even worse, a LARGE percentage of low reviews over 1.5 years state that the company has been shorting employee pay, only paying a fraction of what is owed.

I contacted Glassdoor but they just reiterated that they were **unable** to do anything. 

The only logical conclusion that I can take from this experience is that Glassdoor is a useless service and is *probably* paid to keep such blatantly fabricated reviews online.

I encourage you to go through the reviews and judge for yourself. I wanted to prevent others from wasting their time, but as long as Glassdoor is enjoying it's profit, they really don't care.

Are there any other sites that are more reputable?"
How can I find companies that will pay me to work in Alaska?,"I had an old coach tell me that he was close friends with a guy who's company paid for him and his wife to accept a position in Alaska.

"I like what I do, but I feel I don't fit in my industry and it's causing anxiety.","I've been with my current (fairly large) company for a little over a year as a contractor. No idea whether or not a FT position will open. I'm not managment and I design/develop internal eLearning.

Where I've always struggled here is that I don't have the understanding of ""the business"" that my other teammates have. I've tried, but TBH I find it quite uninteresting so that makes it difficult for me to understand. Historically this wasn't expected of me so it's not something I'm accustomed to. 

I feel like I don't quite fit in because of this and it's frustrating. I also fear it could compromise my job here at some point. 

It is wrong to just want to be good at what I do, produce quality deliverables and learn about the business organically as I work with different teams rather than need to know/understand ""bigger picture"" plans management and other teams are involved in?

Maybe the corporate environment just isn't for me and I would do better where I felt what I did was making a difference or if I worked in an industry that I had some sort of passion for. I don't dislike the industry I'm in now, but I don't seem to have any type of passion for it.

This is causing me a lot of anxiety, and I'm not sure what responses I'm looking for, maybe just some validation that I'm not the only one feeling like this. It's not that I refuse to learn more about the business, I have genuinely tried and I just don't grasp the bigger picture. It makes me feel  very insecure and very much like a failure."
How do you deal with a customer who cancels meetings at the last minute all the time?,"I'm in sales and one of my contacts is a Director for a large company in our area.  I've been really surprised at her overall lack of organization and time management.  We have multiple projects that we work on for her at a time.  Things seem to fall through the cracks mostly on her end, but sometimes on ours.  I've started to play project manager for her in order to make sure things progress and so she can be aware of the status of the dozen or so things we have in the works.  I tried to setup a weekly conference call or meeting  (30 minutes).  I picked up on the idea that she didn't want to meet every week, so I scheduled them every other week.  The thing is she has a habit of cancelling an hour before the meetings.  Today she didn't even bother to send a cancellation.  I responded to one of her emails during the time we were supposed to be having our call and she says she can't make the call, but will still like an answer to her email.  It's gotten to a point of hilarity because she will cancel and then send multiple emails about the topics we would be addressing during our calls."

Is working mostly trying to keep your job?,"At almost every company I've been at (either as employee or contractor) I see the same pattern:

90 % of people are **always** stressed. And they will not hesitate to tell you about their huge workload. When you dig deeper, it turns out they only did 2 minor things the whole week.

The other 10 % openly admit they have time on their hands - and are seen as the guys that are too lazy. So, slowly, those 10 % become less and less.

As a contractor, there was usually our team (the developers) and some kind of strategic team on the client's side. More often than not, the project was delayed (scope creep) because if the project would have finished on time, they (the strategic client team) wouldn't have had any work anymore. One client openly admitted the project is only still running in order to have work for 3 people.

So, my question is: Is having a job mostly ""looking busy""?"
Why is hiring old people so bad?,"I’m interested to find out what makes older employees (like me) so bad.

I can imagine there are 10,000 reasons why people don’t hire olds, but are any of them actually true, and to why extent, and how does that compare to any benefits, etc.?

When I used to interview, I’d pretty much give an automatic thumbs down or lukewarm reception at best to anyone who was ‘old’ — which was prob 30+ at the time. The reason? I didn’t want any pikers — I wanted someone who was going to sell their soul/sanity/health to the company for 80+ hours per week, and olds had families and just myriad other things in their lives.  

OK that was my personal experience as a hiring person. Now I’m on the other side of 40. Justice! 😂

But take for instance IBM — they fire everyone over say 35. Kind of Nazi-style — hey, they have the experience! 😂

But why is it so important for them to do this?

I imagine it’s straight economics for them — fire the 40yo making $80k hire the fresher making $40k, done.

That’s no small difference.

But what about new hiring? Are young kid always better than olds? Or is just a combination of things you get with young people?
* compliance/desperation
* cheaper labor 
* pliability 
* less expensive health care 
* prettier
* willing to work longer hours 
* smarter/sharper
* better versed in newer tech
* better attitude
Etc

Yeah wow that’s a lot.

I would generally agree with all that, but I wonder if there is an actual argument for keeping at least some old people on staff.

Like, older people with relatively inexpensive salaries in key positions could actually help a company more than a bunch of freshens?

I figure I might have one more job in me before I have to do my own company because nobody is going to hire me anymore.

Thanks for any thoughts. Interested in studies that might help us older folks get hired."

Job has no breaks and it sucks,"(AZ) 

I just got hired at this local coffee shop, i had my first day yesterday of a 6.5 hour shift. I did great on the job, everything came really easy. But there were a couple red flags before I started that sort of make sense now.


I got a call the day after i applied online. He asked a few questions about scheduling and all, then mentioned there's a high turnover rate. Red flag #1


On Monday I got an interview, the girl was young and very chill. She asked maybe 3 questions , forgot my name and what experience I had on my resume. Then said ""well i like you, when can you start?"" I'm desperate for money right now, so i said asap.


 Then we went into the shop and she was telling me about it all. Then she mentioned that two people just started and left suddenly for no reason. Red flag #2

Now during my shift, I asked about breaks, she ignored that part and answered another part of my question. The other 2 people working with me didn't get a break, nor was the word even said. My feet hurt so bad after standing for over 6 and a half hours, on top of Walking to and from the shop.


Now i know in arizona, there are no laws regulating breaks, employers don't have to give on. But do you think this is some kind of sign about the company itself?"

I've never been through a company acquisition before, and I don't want to start a job only to get laid off. I also have no interest in working for that larger company if this smaller company does get taken over. My current manager came from that larger company and he has not said a single positive thing about it."
"If I get hired as an Admin. Assistant, how likely is it I'll be some boss' errand boy?","I've seen a few good companies posting for administrative assistants lately, and that type of work seems like it would be something I'm good at, and it would pay higher than my current job (by also 10k a year).

Although it's not what is expressed in the job post, my concern is that it'll end up being one of those jobs where I'm getting constant phone calls/emails from the boss asking me to do stupid crap like send his wife flowers, have his car cleaned, etc.

I'm perfectly content with answering the phone, emails, handling mailing, and various bits of paperwork.  Being like a manservant is something that makes me nervous of the position."
"The company I work for is being sold (with potential buyers), what should I do?","Background: I have been working for this company for 1.5 years as a production planner. It has been a family owned company for 80 years (since the 1940s). Unfortunately, the owners have had health problems (stroke and mental problems). We are a profitable company that supplies a niche apparel product. We are still gaining new customers, creating new designs, and etc. We have several patents. We own two manufacturing plants in Central America. I work in the stateside distribution center (located here for 30 years).

Today we had a meeting with this information provided. The company have four potential buyers. They are optimistic about them. They have been trying to sell for years but the owners were only interested in investors not a large competitor buying. All four companies interested are smaller than ours. Two are in the same apparel as ours. One sells a product that is a direct competitor. Some have distribution centers, some have manufacturing plants but in Asia.

Management seemed positive but management is also older and closer to retirement. They are also less expendable. They said a lot of stuff (they have always presented the company as a whole, this will help the company grow, the companies interested are ""good people"", etc) but it is hard to tell if it is just corporate speak or not. They are in the ""due diligence"" part of the sell.

I have a Bachelor's but it is in Special Education. The town I am living in is **very** small and in the Midwest. I bought a house last year and am going to be paying that off for the next 20 years. I am a naturally pessimistic person so this is stressing me out.

HELP! promotional Agency has ridiculous policies. Any advice would be appreciated,"I work for a promotional agency in London, UK as a 'Brand Ambassador' (fancy way of saying 'twat who hands out leaflets in the street') they advertise shifts on their web portal and 'employees' apply

I have queries/complaints and am unsure if they're legitimate or not. Number 1 is the one that really grates me

1. **Pay**

The company I work for does not process our payslips- in order for us to have our payslips and tax deducted, we have to pay an external payroll company 10% from our own wages (capped at £70 a month) this is something that really annoys me as another colleague who works fewer hours, will pay less to get their payslip even though they're getting the same service.

a)is this legal/allowed and am i technically ''employed'' or ''self employed''?

b) can I claim this payment back as an expense?

c) isnt this the agencies responsibility?

&#x200B;

2)**Breaks**

The company enforces a no breaks policy for shifts which are less than 6 hours. story time: I was working a shift from 11:30am-6:30pm, from 11:30-3 I was standing in heavy rain (wearing only a branded t-shirt and trousers with an umbrella) I had not ONCE left my spot to go to the bathroom or sat down. 2 of my colleagues went on a lunch break and a 3rd went to the toilet. the client then comes out and sees me stretching and calls the CEO of the company, who comes down and tells me ''the client says that you're doing \*\*\*\* all'' obviously stunned, I didnt say anything but was seething for the rest of the day-and wrote a strongly worded message to my manager (diplomatically saying that the CEO is a idiot)

I have also had to take a drinks break in the past as i was feeling lightheaded and close to the point of fainting, and had a staff checker saying its not allowed.

&#x200B;

3) **cancellation/returning items**\- the company also enforces a policy where if you're unable to attend a shift (e.g illness), you'll be fined £60, however, if you give enough notice that you'll be unable to attend because of an interview/hospital appointment, along with failure to return items-such as branded t-shirts/leaflets

Again- is this allowed, to be fined for being unable to work because of an illness?

A manager has asked me to write a review on social media about how ''great'' it is to work there- if I actually wrote how I feel, can they fire me/claim unfair dismissal?"
"Calling out on the day of work, or ""no call no show"": which kind of job can you risk immediately losing if you do this kind of thing even once?",I just got thinking about this because I've had 2 retail jobs in the past and for each of those when I wanted to quit I just stopped showing up. Also there's been times where I called out on the morning *of* like an hour before work. Obviously these are not good and I've stopped doing it but I'm thinking - which kind of job will you get canned or talked to if you do this once?
Anyone have any experiences with working for a performing arts group/school?,"I might have an interview next week for a web developer position. I heard about it through a recruiter and it's with a world-renowned performing arts school in a major metropolitan area. I have a deep interest in the arts so working with an institution like this one is well-aligned with my personal being.

I'm supposed to receive the full job description very shortly, but other than that I don't know much about the job. Scanning their site with Wappalyzer shows Drupal, PHP, React, jQuery, AWS, etc."
Reason behind offering free drinks and ping-pong table/video games/other perks,"Not talking about providing decent health-care coverage and paid vacation. But I have noticed a trend verbalized by another subreddit I've noticed earlier today. That is, drumming up how the company provides free drinks, awesome ping-pong table, video game console (Nintendo Switch, Playstation, XBox, etc.). Is this normally deployed as a recruitment and retention tactic, more specifically using them as a bait for employees to stick around for longer hours for less pay, and make them more dependent on the company for social life (b/c they are working so much) so that the thought/decision of quitting is made more difficult, particularly when times get tough/abusive? Hope I sound clear. "
Is working at UPS or Amazon a decent career?,"So to give a little bit of background, I’m a full time mechanic, I have no benefits, no pension, no 401k and the pay for mechanics in my state is low (might cap around 26$ hour). I’m 23 years old and I make 18$ an hour. My question is, is working for a company like UPS or Amazon a good career change choice. I have bills of my own that I can not really afford to lower my income. I’m not really a desk type of person so call centers aren’t really my thing. Does anyone have experience working for these companies and what can I expect to make working there? I know it’s probably not the smartest to switch careers but I’m torn. This industry is very hard for you to make money. I would probably make 30k to 60k in this field working 70 - 80 hours a week."

Percent of travel for 10 to 15 trips a year?,If a job posting indicates that there will be travel between 10 to 15 trips per year what does that translate into percentage wise?
The environment of a payroll company,"Someone I know works for a payroll company providing services for small to med size businesses. He currently has a role as an payroll specialist for implementation. Any time I talk to him about what is going on with work, he is always stressed to the limit. He enjoys the challenge of trying to make various agendas work and has no problem grinding long hours to get it done, but in my opinion, something must be wrong with the company or its just the nature of the business. 

Firstly, the “team” that he is on is more or less a joke. It’s him and 2 others. Any time anyone takes a day off (which happens every week due to family needs) the team is over worked trying not to drown in the amount of work to do. When he takes a day off, he returns to around 200 email, 15 voicemails, 5-10 issues that are on fire, and 3-4 issues that have blown up with his name on it and has to figure out what department didn’t follow protocol. Other departments seem to dump their agendas on them as well to figure out. I have heard so many stories that their team has to figure out a new process to support another team (who has about 15 dedicated employees) because there manager literally doesn’t want to deal with it because they have seniority. This chaos has been going on nonstop for about 8 months and doesn’t look like it will get better considering 4th quarter is the busiest time of the year.

This is just a simple summary of this environment. Is this typical for this type of job or is the company just spread too thin and doesn’t optimize efficient operations?"
Payroll card.,"Sorry if this is a r/lostredditor moment I'm not sure where else to post this. I got a job at Jamba juice yadda yadda yadda. Anywhale, they use payroll cards. I know these work like debit cards except aren't connected to a bank account.

What do you do at work when you have nothing to do and can’t leave?,"Unfortunately, this tends to be a weekly problem for me at my job.

DAE work in a very mixed social class workplace?,"What I mean is in the same office (within vicinity of each other) there's folks who have a good education, make well into 6 figures, have a nice vehicle, nice house in the upper middle class suburbs and just cruising through life for the most, and others who have GED's who may be just barely making it after their paychecks, they may be commuting from far away due to living costs, paying child support for multiple kids, just going nowhere in life financially.

"I think I am in a odd job to be pay to do very little just to fulfill the funding requirements, and I am confused.","Can you guys shed me some light on my current status? I think I am in a role that my existence was just to be used by the company to attract more funding, to be the very technical backup, and I feel very confused.

I have a special license rare here. It was hard to me to find a job in the same field in the city but so is the company. So we come together and I am hired. It was not big money but at least I am above city’s average pay and I am happy at least now. There are some very technical stuff I did for a couple of months and some statistical analyses. After that, I was laid there with no task, so I am idle for a few months already.

It is a start-up and it is winning funds from angel funds or series A funding whatever. I suspect that my existence was solely to fulfill funding requirements and for some very technical backups.

Of course, I asked them if there is anything I can help, but there is very little to do. So literally I was sat there surfing the internet or learning my stuff for 8 hours a day.

Earlier, they even hinted that my position would likely never required to go overtime, while as I observed OT in this company is fairly common. My mentors, which were not strictly my supervisor, hinted that if I had nothing to do, I can go learn coding. Or ask for some really labourous task like manual packing the products for them, which I do not like. One even openly said that I can decide to not show up, as long as the tasks are done, I am good. BUT NO TASK FOR A MONTH ALREADY!

I even slipped away for a driving test and went to the government to renew my license. I would not say they are noticing, but definitely nothing is happening even if they noticed.

So should I stay longer?

The twist point is, I used to have depression and suicidal thoughts for long time and I am on progress to cure. I do not really have much marketable skills. So somewhat I have to pretend working in the office along the company’s founder starting from Friday, which might be something hard to do I am not sure… I used to have my own little office in a remote warehouse where one people might come in every week. I was alone, and I was good. But I won't be alone anymore.

Learning in the office might be a good idea, but I am not sure if my room-sharing founder gonna like it..

Any advise?"
Got a call from a company I applied for but there's a small problem,"Hello everyone, I hope you're doing okay!

I'm in a rather uncomfortable situation. But let me start by giving some background info!

A month ago, I was working and one of the customers I got to talk to is in a very good position in another bigger company. So I asked him if they were hiring. He immediately gave me his email adress and told me to send him my CV. Did that during my break and got no reply. 

Didn't get my hopes up since that company usually hires people who are really close to each other (x's son, x's brother, etc). In other words, it's kinda difficult to get in, but they are building a new plant nearby so I took a chance.


The main thing here is, the day before yesterday I was working (we cannot carry our mobile phones with us, safety measures and bla bla bla). So I take my break, check my phone, and see a missed call from a number I don't know. I googled it, and the name of such company appears everywhere. 


What I did was call them but no one answers, it doesn't even give me the option to leave a message.
In my country we have a long holiday period starting from yesterday to next Monday... so I was wondering if I should call them again and try my luck or wait it out until Monday and see if I get a call.

What do you think about this situation? Could it be possible it's them? There wouldn't be any other reason to call me than to at leeeeast try to hire me?

I'm kinda confused but anxious at the same time because it would be a very good job offer.

Also, the phone number IS the one from the company. Double,triple and quadruple checked....heh.

Any advice? I want to stay positive

Thank you!"
Is this an unreasonable request by my boss/his bosses?,"Hey reddit. I've posted here a few times before and have typically gotten some good advice, so I'd thought I'd post here again.

I started this position about 5 months ago and it's been fine so far, nothing special but it's the highest paid job I've had so far (I'm 25).

Anyways, my working hours are 8:00 - 4:30 (I am supposed to take a 30 minute lunch, but I usually just end up working while I eat). Even before and after I get home from work, I am still responding to some work emails on my phone (which I'll count on my time sheet even though I am **salaried**).

When I got into work today, my boss told me that 'things are all about perception' and has asked me to stay until at least 5, if not longer. He then went on to say that a new (as in started 3 weeks ago) business development 'higher-up' noticed that me leaving at 4:30 just means that I am apparently not busy enough... Even though I have great time management skills and am able to do all my work in the allotted 8 hours while at work.

I was then asked if I could start working 9 - 11 hours every day, and then asked me to start taking on more responsibilities (I just checked out my job description (I can find it on our ATS, and the job description is only about 50% of what I actually do).

So not only do they want me to work 3 extra hours every day, just for ""perception"", they also want me to start doing way more than what I was originally told I'd be doing. So I'm not very happy.

I know that I've only been here for 5 months, but it would be outlandish for me to ask for some kind of raise, right? I just am not happy that I'm gonna be asked to stay for a couple hours longer (when I'll just be BSing, since I won't have any work to do). Am I also being unreasonable for thinking this is just absurd? Don't you just LOVE American Corporate Culture!!

&#x200B;

**Update: I asked my boss about compensation for my extra duties that were not apart of the JD, as well as for the extra time expected and he basically said, ""I wish it worked that way. I didn't get a raise when I got promoted to 'Director of Recruiting' even with the added responsibilities and tasks"" so it looks like I probably won't ever get any kind of raise; Gonna start looking/putting out feelers tonight after I update my resume.**"
How to leave a union?,"I'm a public employee, and I am currently in the IBEW union, paying dues of $100 every month. I learned that employees are still covered by the union even if I don't pay these dues. I originally joined the union to get their health plan, but I am looking to switch it. I also need to save as much money as possible right now.


I called to try to stop paying dues, but they gave me a hard time about it - prodding me about why I want to stop and what the union has to offer. I could hear her fumbling her words because she could not think of anything besides some luncheon and being able to vote for union stuff.


I'm not even a big fan of unions. I feel like they encourage laziness. But even for the positives it brings, like safety measures and stuff, a lot of these do not apply to me. The union is for electrical and construction workers, while I'm a programmer who just sits at his desk all day.


The lady then said they only accept this on ONE day of the year, and I have to send in a hand-written letter of resignation for this. Is this bullshit or a common practice? Anyone have luck in opting out of union fees?

**EDIT** Or on the flip side, can anyone convince me to continue paying my dues? $1200 a year is a lot of money. I guess they do negotiate a high salary for all of us, but I got a really uncomfortable, brain-washing and threatening vibe from them on the phone."

Joined a sinking ship?,"Hello!

I recently accepted a position at a company that is not doing so well. This is my first position after College/Internship. Its been a little over a month, and there have been a couple of red flags.

-Constant replacement of CEOs in the last four years. I wanna say 4-5 different ones.

-A majority of managers and supervisors in my department haven't been employed with the company for more than a couple of years, if that. Our  director has been with us for six months. Other positions vary from region to region. I keep hearing a couple months in the higher level positions.

-Many of our regional leadership are leaving the organization. In my area alone we've lost major HR leaders and managers. Even my direct boss is leaving, which worries me even more because they were heavily involved in creating my position.

-Talks of selling to competitors. I've been hearing rumors that the organization is looking to sell, though it has not been successful getting fair market value. Even if they do sell, I could be laid off due to the fact that other companies outsource positions similar to mine.

-Closures, layoffs, and loss of business. Facilities have been losing many contracts, and thus have had to layoff staff and close smaller facilities.

I am not looking to quit. I am really getting into my role, and I even received praise from many of my leaders.

I am not sure what to do if I end up losing this job in the near future. My job search was a very tiring experience. I did do some research, but there wasn't anything that made me want to not accept the role.

Really just looking for some advice."
What are the grooming standards at Quality Oil LLC?,"I'm currently looking for transitional work between skilled jobs, just something to hold me over and pay the bills for a few weeks.

The job is effectively gas station cashier/shelf-stocker I have a slightly longer KC Mitchell-style Mohawk and a goatee, and I don't feel like shaving both or either off, especially for something that only pays $8.50/hr.

[HELP] Let go from my job due to 'budget constraints' - 2 months later the company wants me back!,"So in early January, I was let go from my training position (a few weeks before my pay was legally due to rise), they used the typical 'we don't have the budget' excuse, which I didn't buy for a second. It was a job I worked my ass off in and got really good at, the entire team was dependant on me covering their shifts so they could travel and visit clients. Because it was an intern type position, It took me a 9-12 months before I really started to gain the knowledge and call the role my own, the company didn't really put a big effort into training me - I self taught the functions of the software myself. 

So they threw away all the experience I gained and will now have to train another person from scratch now that they've gotten rid of me. This was all probably because I would have cost them a little bit more, so they'd rather bring in a new trainee instead of paying me a bit more. They probably could afford it, but saw the opportunity to save a quick buck.

A week or two later when looking for a new job, I see my old position being advertised on a job board, the closing gate kept on getting extended and extended by a few weeks every time. I can only presume this is because they couldn't get to replace me with.

Fastforward to yesterday, I get an email from my old boss - saying they want me back and are willing to offer me the full time job that I didn't get last time. Pay is okayish but isn't the best, the company isn't that big and so doesn't really pay people that well in general.

Thoughts? I've been applying for two months now for equivalent but much higher paying trainee jobs that I'm qualified for, some with huge companies. Should I accept the offer or keep plugging away?

**Tl;DR: Company let me go, thinking they could cheaply replace me with another trainee. That plan appears to have failed, and now they want me back full time.**

They wrote a book titled ""It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work""

Is it true? Or is to work there just as crazy as anywhere else?"
What do we think about staffing agencies ?," My job laid me off (I have the most experience in health care admin) bc the doctor was writing too many scripts . 

So I went to a staffing agency , and they have been disorganized , flakey , and have lied  to me about the jobs , the location of the job and the pay . 

They got me in there by saying they had something “perfect” for me and they could match me at 14.50$ hour ,

Now , their “clients “ can’t match my rate and they want me to basically start telemarketing at 8am to 5pm in their office as a “junior recruiter “ 

Monday and Friday they texted me last minute saying that the boss was in a meeting and I only needed to come in at 12 . 

Today I slept past my alarm bc we lost electricity last night . I have to be honest I don’t feel so bad bc they haven’t been consistent . 

My friend went to a different agency and she said she got the similar run around . They didn’t have the jobs they said in the interview. But they could use her “internally” 

One thing I thought was weird during my time there was how my “boss” said she had to always beg people to come to work . But the handbook basically says if you leave voluntarily , you can’t get unemployment . 

Has anyone used a staffing agency before ? Which one did you have luck with?

Edit : I’m in PA , USA"
Upshift .. the app,"Has anyone used this ? I posted earlier today about my new job lying about my position and then giving me a hard time about sick leave for surgery done days before I accepted offer . I found this app but not a lot of info about it . Usually companies pay big money for a staffing firm , so I was curious on how it works . 

 sorry if this has been posted , if it has ,can someone DM me The link ? Thank you !"
Is my.peoplematter legit?,"I put in an online app at a chain pizza place and got an email to do a background check.

I'm a little sketched out to put that info on a site I've never used/heard of. Anyone have any experience with it?"
When executives leave,"Hi, I am relatively junior in my field (software). Around 4 months ago, CFO of the company (50 people) left. Two days ago, CEO resigned. We have an interim CEO.

I personally was not given an explanation but have a bad feeling about it. I don't see how CEO can just resign without explanation from a cushy position, really hard to get. I use logic and deduce that it must be financial reasons because quitting like that is surely not for personal reasons.

I am bothered by CFO leaving a few months ago.

Am I just paranoid or my logic is correct?"
How can I prove I deserve more hours?,I’ve gotten my hours slashed at Chick-fil-A for no other reason than “slow business”. I’ve been getting shitty 10 hour weeks. I have coworkers back me up saying I don’t deserve low hours and that I’m consistent and should get more. I’ve already tried complaining to the manager but I got nowhere. I might need to try again. Advice?

Company is being bought. Questions to ask future employer?,"Just got news from my boss that a representative from the company that is buying us is coming into the office tomorrow. We haven't been told yet how pay/jobs will change with the new takeover, but I do know that they will be reinterviewing every current employee to decide if we will be kept on. I don't know what to expect for tomorrow. No one really does. But I would like to have some questions ready just in case I have the opportunity to ask."

Question for people who work physical jobs,"So I just started a summer job as a landscaper after graduating college while I continue to apply for salaried jobs and look for a career.

I’ve been doing this for just over a week and I already have got my ass kicked. I come home tired and sore and know that in just a few hours I’ll be off to bed to do the same thing tomorrow.

What do you guys who work physical jobs do to keep yourself in 100%? Im seriously considering buying one of those tubs for my feet and icing them. Maybe some supplements like creatine? I’ve been getting good sleep which helps but shit is still brutal. 

Please don’t think I’m a baby back b*tch for this post lol. I’m not gonna quit and I ain’t complaining, I’m just looking for ways to be less sore and tired all the time."
Can Jobs really have “mandatory” overtime?,"I work at a call center and they’re demanding mandatory overtime because of a hurricane. Now I’m suppose to work 5 extra hours somewhere in all my PTO. (I have paid time off for the reminder of the month starting next Tuesday).

It pisses me off. So I have to basically work 10 or 12 hours on shifts because of all the time off. Is this legal?"
Anyone familiar with this job model?,"I was just contacted by the 2nd company that practices this business model. The short version is that they offer training for a set amount of weeks (normally 5-7) and they pay you during training. After the training you get hired on by a company for a set period of time. The first company that reached out was a company called MThree. I had to take a technical test after speaking to the recruiter. Then after you pass the test you get a technical interview. I completed all of that and afterwards hadn't heard back from them. They had told me the next training class started on April 14th and they would fly me out to Manhattan. 

Today a company called Mobile Consulting Solutions. This company offered training in android development and this time in Atlanta Georgia. This test wasn't as difficult but he immediately called me back and told me I passed and went over specifics of the job. We set up for a Skype interview tomorrow (4/25/2019).

Has anyone ever accepted an offer from them? I was really looking forward to that Mthree position but oh well. The model sounds good in theory there's just a certain skepticism about it. I'm getting desperate in my job search though so I'm thinking of taking it."
Is This How All Jobs Are In 2019?,"So I finally have a full-time job two years after finishing college.

My current job entails full stack web development, marketing, graphic design, and IT. I also supervise an employee. To be honest, I don’t really like my job. Part of it’s the pay. The other part is because I’m expected to maintain and extend web applications, all while designing marketing materials and helping people with their technology issues. All of these are different skill sets.

I was wondering if the whole “having the responsibilities of three jobs at once” thing is still the norm in today’s job market. From what I can tell, 2008 brought the consolidation of jobs as companies couldn’t afford so many employees, so “close-enough” jobs got combined. In my case, my job could easily be four different people in better economic standings.

So that leads me to my question: is it normal to have a job where many varying duties are part of the position’s responsibilities?"
Asking for my job title?,"Hi!

I was working for this job full time and then switched to part time/contractor. My job title is still the same as when I started. My colleagues around me have had title promotions. I think it's because I'm part time my title hasn't stayed the same. They pretty much just treat me like all their other employees except I'm working fewer hours per week. Now I do a specialized tech part of the company which is vital to the company. I'm looking to apply for some other jobs and would probably benefit for a more specialized title than the one I got starting at the company right out of graduation. Should I ask for a title change? Also, they will probably wonder why I am asking for a title change and realize that I'm applying to other jobs and I don't really want that to cross their mind right now. Thanks!"
Boss leaching the client. How to deal with it?,"My boss was developing a project for his client and I was hired to lead the marketing team for this specific project only. 

All is good but i have realized that my boss delivers such low quality work that product is bound to fail down the line.

I tried warning my boss about the same but he said, in the given budget this is all we can do. 

What shall I do? Stick by my employer who will fire me if product goes down or save the client from losing millions?

Please suggest.

Thank you!"
Employer Missed Payroll. Do I Jump Ship ASAP?,"- Working as a legal assistant for a criminal law firm
- we have financial issues and many outstanding debts. 
- Payroll has always been iffy in the few months that ive been there. There have been multiple times where I've had to go to my boss' house to pick up my pay cheque. 
- Today my boss has gone radio silent. It's 4 minutes left of my shift and I have yet to receive my cheque."
Working for a 'hip' company,"My current situation is that I am horribly underpaid and it is time for me to leave my current job. It sucks because i do like my team, the work and even my boss (minus the pay part) but after 13 years, it's time to go. My current place is an old company and it is pretty bland around here. They try to do some fun stuff but there is still this old school mentality. 

In my large metro area, there are several cool looking company's with some fun looking office environments. People wearing t-shirts and jeans, free snacks, Nerf guns, etc. While all of that looks cool and fun to me (age wise, i am an older-Millennial) i cant help but think its just a facade to cover up insane hours and crap pay. 

What are your experiences with places like this? All i want is decent compinstation and work-life balance."
How much do you trust Glassdoor reviews?,"I have an interview this Thursday, but I’m seeing mixed reviews for the company on Glassdoor. Some are great, and some are not so great. I’m not sure what I should believe. 

The company I’m at now isn’t great and I’m trying to get out, but I don’t want to jump into something worse. 

Have any Glassdoor reviews you’ve read turned out to be true after you started a new job?"
Working job for roughly 3 months. Company lied about literally everything.,"Lets start here:

I've worked in this field (information technology) for awhile now. From programming (nothing fancy moved to network admin because I didn't like it much) but mostly as a Network admin.

I found a job while unemployed (last job didn't fire me, the company closed) so in the mean time I decided to look for work. Well over 1000 applications all around my area and I got one hit.

Job description: 17-25 dollars an hour depending on certs, experience, and education. Network administration (right up my ally.) Come in to the first interview: 

""Well we don't have the capacity for network administration just yet, but that's what you will become in about 60 days from starting. We are looking for experienced people."" 

""Ok, that's acceptable, will I need to build the network?"" 

""Nope.""

Went into my second interview. Got told ""you are hired."" First day I was told everything I was told up to this point was a lie. I would be paid 12.5 an hour if I accepted. I told them I wouldn't take it for less than 16, they told me ""Ok we offer 15 or leave. There is no room for advancement as that is the cap out pay for this position."" I asked about the job being a network admin job or becoming that ""Nope won't happen."" I took the job mostly because I needed something to hold me over. In my area the standard is staying at a job for at least 6 months before quitting or you won't find work even at a gas station, so now I'm stuck here.

Currently this position has hired 6-7 people, every single one is over qualified. Since staring they have changed our title 3 times: Network Admin -> Network Helpdesk -> Technical Call Center Associate.

This has really *REALLY* gotten under my skin. I'm at my half way point with this company towards 6 months. Now one saving grace this place has is the following: We don't do much of anything. Perday I'm taking about 10-15 calls, this takes me roughly 5-20 minutes a call. So there is a lot of free time to do nothing.

Well now this place is pushing us writing SOP's for network administration. I'm simply not going to do it tbh. I don't care. You want SOP's for network administration out of me? Pay me 21 dollars an hour and I'll make those SOP's for you. They are now pushing us using network administration tools but refusing to increase our pay. I'm simply not going to use them. I'm just not going to fucking do it. You want me to act as a network admin? Pay me as a network admin.

We work with helpdesks around the world, and all I can say is they are the most incompetent helpdesks I've ever worked with. Several in the English speaking world and they are no better either. If I pass clients or internal people to them, the people at those help desks will scream at me, and the client. Why? Even if its for their helpdesk they will scream. I literally had one guy on the phone screaming that he wouldn't do any work because he just didn't feel like it.

This company doesn't follow any industry standard. Not around security, or how a helpdesk should be structured. I've tried brining this up multiple times (I could build a helpdesk that runs more efficiently with 1/3rd the people this one has in a few hours.) My supervisor has brought the same things up to our management and they refuse to listen. Bare in mind this is a multi-national company with quite literally millions of clients. We get fishing phone calls daily.

Now lets get to my counterparts: Most of them either have one, or multiple degrees in this field, several certifications, and more experience than me. Two run side businesses that the company is now asking them to close to which they said ""nope. Not going to happen.""

One of the supervisors who have nothing to do with us has been actively complaining about how 'little' we do. He complained that all we do is look at facebook (Sorta true, but the only reason everyone at this desk hasn't walked out is because we don't do much. Everyone here is way overqualified.)

All I know is I will have two more certifications before I leave this place and I'm absolutely stunned at how this place manages to make any money.

So seriously what the fuck? Has anyone had this experience before?

TL;DR redux: ""We need network admins but no budget, hire them as helpdesk and insist they act as a network admin. Just lie through your teeth to get these people."" Another way of putting this: ""We need a master welder, but we cant pay one, hire a welder as a bag boy at the grocery store and tell him its either weld or else. Lie however it takes to get him into the position."""
Just So Everyone Knows...,"I've seen this at other companies before. Where one employee does something their not supposed to (late to work, process issues, work ediquette).

"I'm contracted to work for a government agency but my paycheck is signed by the contracting company, not the government agency. Who should I say I work for when I update my job on LinkedIn and similar sites.","I work for NOAA and go to work at the NOAA facility every day, and my bosses are all NOAA employees. But I'm a contracted employee and this other company signs my paychecks. I'd like to just put that I work for NOAA on my LinkedIn because the name holds some weight and is more impressive than this other company which isn't very well-known.

&#x200B;

I could put both agencies, but then it won't link to the NOAA page or to the other agency's page. There's no option to correctly set up two different companies for one position, and I kind of like having the NOAA picture next to my current position on LinkedIn. Is it bad to just put that I work for NOAA if I mention that I'm a contracted employee in the job description?"
What are out-of-pocket expenses?,"If a company says they will reimburse you for the out-of-pocket expenses what does this mean? 

I’m guessing it’s the money you spend getting to work such as train tickets. But what I don’t get is they say they will pay for gasoline as well as subsidence. But how do they count that? 

For example, if I travel to work one day and then after work I decided to take a 100 mile drive for the hell of it and then the next day gave them my receipts. Or in the morning because I know I get reimbursed, I order a big breakfast. How would they be able to tell with the gasoline part how much to reimburse me by because how would they know how much of it was used to actually get to work and what was used for personal reasons? 

I’m guessing with the food part they can check the time on the receipt and I guess it’s up to them to decide if I’m being fair on how much I’m eating for subsidence to qualify for getting reimbursed. But it’s really the gasoline part that’s confusing me."
Software Developer looking for tech companies offering sponsorship (E3 visa for Australian citizen),"Hi,

I'm a Software Developer many years of experience and I'm looking for a job opportunities in San Francisco.

I'm from Australia and am attempting to try get an E3 visa sponsorship. I know that all best big companies like Google, Facebook, etc. are offering this kind of visa, they also are pretty hard to get an offer from.

I wonder if there are other companies (if any) which will be willing to offer sponsorship? Basically all job offers I've found online contains this statement 'Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.' 

I was wondering if any San Francisco based recruiters would give me some general advice? Is this even possible to find employer who will offer sponsorship except those best known big companies?

I would appreciate any sort of help or general advice."
"Recruiter contacted me for a position I don't remember applying for, and they aren't listed on Indeed. Scam?","This morning I got a text message from a recruiter asking if I was still interested in a business assistant position. They told me they got my application on Indeed, but I don't remember submitting one, and when I looked their company up on Indeed, they weren't listed to begin with. We've been going back and forth over text about what the job entailed and where they are located. When I look them up, they are across the country. This recruiter (possibly the CEO) told me that this is a work from home job in which I would be setting up schedules, flights, and assisting in payroll. When I looked up their company online, I don't see an office, but an apartment building. They don't even have a website. I need a job, but this just doesn't seem legitimate to me.

Edit: I just rescinded my application, thank you all for knocking some sense into me."

Has anyone worked for a small family corporation?,"I had a second interview for a position as an Operations Coordinator at a small brokerage company. Things are looking very hopeful, as they've mentioned that I am the strongest candidate so far. I actually prefer smaller companies because in my experience it's more of a ""human"" work environment. That being said, there is something interesting about this company that I'm not sure will be a positive or a negative down the road. 

&nbsp;

The CEO is an older lady with no husband / kids. There are three other employees, all of whom are related to the CEO (I believe they are her nephews). She plans on retiring in 5 ~ 6 years, leaving the company in her nephews' hands while she oversees from retirement every now and then. I interviewed with all the employees present and they seemed decent enough. 

&nbsp;

That being said, I've never worked for a company that was run by family members. It's definitely interesting, as I don't really know what to expect in terms of workplace dynamics at such an environment. Because there are so few employees though, there are some nice perks like catered lunch everyday and a company lunch outing once a week. They also seem fairly lax about PTO and personal appointments. With all that in mind, I would love to hear first-hand experiences and guidance!"
Is it normal to have a lot of down time in an office job?,"I work at a large company (300,000 employees) and about half of my day is spent sitting around despite asking for more work. This is my first job post college so it's a new experience all together. 


I spend probably close to half of my day just sitting around. I'm nervous about it because I feel like I'm being unproductive. I ask for more work most every day and my workload hasn't increased. I've been here for a few months now so I'm starting to think it's normal, but I'm still unsure of the situation. 


Is it normal to have this much downtime in an office job? If so, what do you do to fill the time and be more productive?"

Data Engineer at McDonald's, Anyone worked as or know anyone that is a data engineer at McDonald's  global headquarters in Chicago? What is the experience like?
When can you not expect other employees to absorb the loss.,"So a friend of mine is leaving her job. She is at a key position (a real worker bee) with this company who has layoffs every year for the past 5 years. She has not gotten a raise in 10 years. Her management thought oh her job is not that had so let's just add the responsibilities to a couple other people and NOT fill her position.

Another friend who works there confirmed that the manager had her write down all of her duties so he could divide them up to others. He was shocked when he found out the main part of her job was only about 20% of what she actually does.

He has now pushed out her responsibilities to no less than 7 employees that are now tasked with absorbing her duties as well as doing their own. 

What does it say about a company that can not afford to fill such a key position and that you have to add these duties to others?"
Annoyed after 90 Days!!!,"Background :
My position is new to the company,  the duties were handled by consultants.   Small Company, very old school approach towards manufacturing. 

I have 10 years in my Niche (QC) manufacturing experience and 5 of those as management. Along with an additional 5 years of Military (QC) experience and a few QMS Auditor certificates.

Here it goes:
So I was recruited for my current position, diners, drinks etc. for almost four months.  Which during this time caused me to mentally checkout at my last company.  When I was finally presented the offer it didn’t thrill me, but I reluctantly accepted.  

First 90 Days have come and gone, and I am still not impressed.  

I started as a team player, introduced myself,  gave my background etc.  Asked other members of management to let me know how I can add value to them and the team (where would they like me to insert myself not to step on their toes) Everything went really well for the first two weeks.

About the mid of my third week we had an issue appear and they asked for my opinion. So I gave my opinion (systematic failure) got dirty looks and quickly ended with “its real easy for me to say this because I wasn’t here when this happened and don’t know any of the specific details.. it’s a completely unbiased view of the situation.”  After this majority have given me the cold shoulder. 

After 30 days I had a 1:1 with my boss (VP) typical review until I asked strategic planning question, which appeared to offend him. I haven’t actually communicated with him in 60 days. Not by my choice, I’ve emailed, I’ve left voicemails, I’ve texted and seen that he has red the text (thank you read receipts) and  I’ve  physically attempted (multiple occasions) to talk but am still “ghosted”..

The president belittles my experience and certifications. Things have gotten better after a few discussions but still annoying.  

In general I feel majority of the staff is just lazy, the type that complain about being busy but take long breaks and lunches and then surf the internet in between those breaks and lunches.  

3 of 4 payroll deposits have been incorrect (under paid)... corrected when I question.

I am trying to remain positive that this is just a “initiation” test,  but I seriously dread going to the office.

What do I do?

Good part-time work from home jobs,I just had surgery and long story short I can only do so much before I have no energy. I move out for college in a few weeks and was wondering what kinda jobs I should look for where I can work from my home computer and have a very flexible schedule
Do companies/recruiters ever get back to you for another position?,"I'm currently looking for my first job after college and so far, I've received a lot of rejections to my applications. However, in some e-mails recruiters say that they will keep my data for the next year in case they have a suitable position for me. What do recruiters do when the company looks for someone? First scan all the 'old' candidates any maybe contacting them and only after that post a job ad online?

I also had two rounds of interview with a company and they said they think I'm a good match but due to Corona, they decided not to hire someone at the moment (no one fresh from college at least). They said they want to get back in touch in the future but I'm worried that by then they have already forgotten."
"I had a nightmare interview with a recruiter years ago, and just scheduled an interview with the same person… Anything I can do?","**UPDATE:** KILLED IT!

""We have some history"" was what they said, so they definitely remembered me. They didn't use the ""expert"" line, but they had some pointers for my resume, which I will actually take into consideration because they were really constructive.

They also said I have an ""excellent resume"", and while the market looks really rough for work these days, I think they will actually do their best to place me. Really glad with how this turned out.

Thanks to everyone for your advice. I was nervous as hell, but I did some prep, had a few answers in my back pocket, and it was definitely one of my better interviews in recent memory.

\------------------------------------------------

So I met with a recruiter 6 years ago when I was having a lot of trouble looking for work. I was nervous as hell but I tried my best to prep, came in with copies of my resume and work samples, bought presentation material, etc.

Basically, the recruiter said that unless I'm ""an expert"" at a particular skill, it shouldn't be on my resume, and that I must be lying on my resume. It was literally the worst interview experience of my life.

Turns out I have a zoom interview for a job next week with this same person. I just lost my job and this opportunity would be a good one, but I have less than zero interest in talking to this person again.

I'm all for constructive criticism, I'd love some on my resume in fact, but what this person did was just demeaning.

I get nervous on interviews as it is, and I'm legitimately not sure how I'm going to do this. Is there a professional way to handle this? Should I just suck it up and do it? Xanex (seriously)?

\------------------------------------------------

***Edit:*** *Whoa, this blew up way more than I thought it would.*

*It's pretty clear I have probably have a good amount of emotion invested in this experience that this person may not even remember. I need to do some prep work for sure, but how it goes from there I think will be determined by their professionalism.*

*It's a job I would like, but wouldn't make my career or anything, so it's not worth taking abuse for, but it's been a while since I've been on an interview, so best to at least get this under my belt and do the best I can with it.*

*Thanks everyone for all the advice. I'll try and provide an update next week.*"
What do recruiters actually do day to day during hiring freezes?,"I'm specifically asking what their actual job is during a hiring freeze, like there is now.

I've been in touch with a FANG recruiter recently who is slow to respond. She kept saying it's been 'crazy busy' due to the pandemic and everyone working remotely, etc.

I'm not trying to be rude here but what could she possibly be working on while there's a hiring freeze and a pandemic?

I don't doubt she's busy, just wondering what the job actually is besides the obvious?"

What are the ways I can use a recruiter's help to get a job?,"So I've connected with 3 recruiters in the past, but I have not really contacted them since the initial contact.

I also really need a decent paying job and have a degree, but haven't really go a real career job before. The jobs I had before didn't even require a bachelors degree. I already understand they get paid a percentage of my paycheck.

This recruiter won't even tell me about the job opportunity but wants me to send in my resume so the hiring manager can look at it.

I'm getting a few initial screening calls, which is positive, but during every call, they promise to send me the job spec right away and I never hear from them again. 

Is this common practice with recruiters? Or is this a sign I'm really bombing my screening interviews? I'd be much happier if they just straight up said I'm not a good fit for the role instead of promising something they know they won't do. I understand that recruiters need to make their call KPIs but I don't see the point in lying to candidates.

Not sure if job field/location is relevant, but I'm in analytics in based in Dublin."
I have an interview with a recruiter on Monday whose title is “Diversity Sourcing Specialist”. What does that mean? I’m a white guy why is she tracking me down to get me to apply for this job? Should I even bother because they’re clearly only interested in women and minorities?,"Edit; I’m going to take the interview the last question was rhetorical.

Maybe it’s because of my status as a military Veteran? Is that some kind of quota they need to fill? Let’s just cut the BS; when a company is looking for “diversity” they mean they’re looking to hire people who aren’t white males. It’s a large international bank and a high paying job but I don’t want to work for a company that hires/promotes people based on race and gender I want to work for a meritocracy. It just seems strange to me that her title is literally “I specialize in hiring people who aren’t white men”. Obviously, if a company even has such a position they’re obviously looking for a specific race/genders (everything but straight white men)."
How honest should I be with the recruiter? Need advice.,"Should I tell the recruiter that I am not accepting the offer because I prefer to start in a certain location first before moving somewhere else?

The thing is I was offered a job in Europe initially (signed it already). But coronavirus destroyed almost everything and now projects are currently on-hold until I-don't-know-when, and now they are offering a job in South Asia. Also I explicitly mentioned during the interview that I am open to be relocated whenever necessary. While this willingness is still true, I would really want to start first in my preferred location (Europe) for maybe 3 months or more before moving somewhere else.

Would it also be fine if I mention to them that I am willing to wait for another project in different location?"
Is it wrong to cancel an interview made through an agency?,"So I just got reminded of this, and wanted to get some feedback. The same agency is contacting me, albeit a different rep, and I want to check if I should avoid.

This agency contacted me when I was looking for temp work, offering a role similar to the job I'd just left. The only problem was it was a few towns over, and I knew from experience that traffic heading into that town could be bad. I voiced my concern with that but the rep was saying 'oh no, that'll be fine. Anyway, can I make the appointment for 10am next Wednesday? I'll send you the job overview and interview prep.Thanks!'

He sent a few bullet points for the job description. No interview prep, no description of the company, nothing. Usually you'd at least get a 'these are links to the company' information. I looked that stuff up on my own and realised that the company was on the opposite side of the town. So to get to it, I'd need to go through the one way system in the town, which at rush hour can take a good half hour on it's own. On top of that, the job description was well above anything I'd done before, more then I was qualified for at the time. I'd had an interview offer for a job that was closer to home and much more suitable.

I called the guy the following day (Friday) and got his voicemail. Ok, fine. I left a message saying that I didn't believe the job would be suitable, gave my reasons, and confirmed that I wouldn't be attending the interview. I also emailed him just in case.

He didn't respond until the Tuesday, when he called at 6pm to tell me it was unprofessional to not attend an interview. I replied that I'd told him with a few days notice and my reasoning. He just huffed and ended the call.

I'm really nervous about dealing with them again after that. Can anyone provide advice?"
LinkedIn summary: Help me word it to let recruiters know I’m interested without my boss seeing?,"Hi all, I’m revamping my LinkedIn and would like to say something along the lines of “open to new opportunities” without actually saying that.

How to politely/effectively get contractors to realize they are misreading my location on my resume/profile?,"In the past, my previous jobs were located in Arizona. However, starting March 21st, I moved into my new residence in Alabama, and accepted a temporary retail job during the COVID-19 quarantine just to pay rent. In April, I decided to rework my resume and create a profile on DICE.com for an IT job. However, despite the fact that my current state of Alabama is mentioned twice before any mentions of Arizona, and that my DICE profile didn't even exist until I had already been living here, every contractor or recruiter than calls me says the same thing: ""But your profile has you listed in Arizona."" It doesn't. It never did. But how do I get all these contractors to realize they hadn't been reading without turning away future contractors who will undoubtedly make the same mistake? No one likes to be blamed for a mistake, and it isn't a good way to make people want to hire you. How should I approach this for next time?"
Is it ok to connect to the recruiter on LinkedIn?,"Hello!!!

Hope all is well with you in this uncertain times.

**Context:**

I received an e-mail on last Friday (8 May) by a recruiter from the retail fashion division of a big company in my country.

They have several business areas, and I applied to opportunities in the food retail division (supply chain and logistics), and by that contact, the recruiter from the other fashion division said in the email that wanted to call me soon, to know my interests and motivations, if it made sense.

As soon as I read the email (end of the day in friday 2hours later), I sent a response thanking for the contact and showing availability to talk about that, and if preferable for them, i was available to arrange a given time to expect a call!

I didnt receive till now a response from the recruiter and at this point I don't know what to do. I searched the recruiter profile in LinkedIn and found it, it has the premium version so later the person will know I visited him.

**My doubt is**: is it too wrong in this phase to connect with the person? I found other 2 recruiters from the same division, one with the same function and other with another...

I would like to expand my network since i have <100 connections (most of them with recruiters only), and because its a dream/perfect company to work that I thought I would never get a shot at working with them.

If I shouldn't connect directly with this recruiter that contacted me, then can I connect with the others? Does this makes sense?

I'm desperate to get a job so I can start working and take off my career, it has been a long journey of 1.5 years looking for a job (while I work in part-times) that meets my profile and wishes for a future career in management related to supply chain **or** sales&marketing.

I know when we are a young graduate you shouldn't narrow too much your options, but I felt confident that would eventually find an opportunity in this fields in the retail sector...

Thanks for any input and recommendations you may give! Have a great day!"
How do I talk with a recruiter?,"Sorry if I sound dumb. Anyway, I have my linkedin set so it shows I am looking for a new job. A recruiter (with many mutual contacts) reached out to me and sent me a kind of vague message saying ""Let me know how I can help you!"". Is this a usual recruiter approach?

How do I respond that isn't ""Please give me new job."" Should I let them know what industry/field I am interested in or tell them my experience?"
To email again or not...,"Hey so I interviewed for a job. A recruiter reached out to me last Wednesday. Went through 2 rounds with a recruit manager, the account manager and was expecting to have another. The account manager whose in charge of placing people in the job at the certain company told me “you will totally get this job, just tell them the same exact things you did at your internship and you’ll be golden, they’re looking for people like you”. 

There are ~40 positions being filled due to high volume of business right now. I was told by the recruit manager last Thursday that she should know more by the beginning of next week and a schedule for last round of interviews (this week). I emailed her Tuesday mid morning asking for an update on where things stand. She replied  “the hiring team is reviewing all resumes and applications today and tomorrow. I will let you know when I hear back from them and whats next!” It’s now Thursday mid morning and I’ve been so anxious because I’m excited for this job... but I also feel like it’s taking longer than they originally told me to schedule a final interview..? The recruit manager seems honest about letting me know either way... but when do I contact her again? Or do I even follow up? I don’t want to be annoying but I’m anxiously waiting to see if I get this job (recent college grad here!) it’s a really great door to a company I’d love to work for... I just don’t know if somehow it’s taking longer than usual because it’s filling so many spots at once?"
"Recruiter from a large, well known company reached out to me on LinkedIn for a position. Am I foolish for even getting my hopes up?","Basically the title. The company is rated well on Glassdoor, has a reputation for being a good place to work, and is one of the major leading companies in its industry. The position would be remote, managing a small team. I've never worked anywhere close to big like this, my current job is the largest company I've ever worked for with about 150 employees. Part of me is super flattered and excited that the recruiter reached out and wants to interview me, the other part of me is thinking who am I kidding? There's no way.

I'm currently employed and happy with where I work, but working at this new place would be such a huge opportunity, not sure if it's even worth daring to hope or if it's just recruiters probably having to meet some sort of quota and that I never really had a shot all along"
"Recruiters/Hiring Managers - Assigning ""mock strategy presentations"" to gather free ideas?","Hey r/jobs,

Happy Thursday! Is it ever a practice for companies to assign ""mock strategy presentations"" in order to generate free ideas, but with no intentions of moving forward with candidates?

I had a third round interview with a company last Monday. I didn't hear anything back until yesterday, where I was given an assignment to provide strategic recommendations next week.

Given the time it took for a follow-up, I'm anxious that they've selected another candidate - but have decided they might as well move me to this next round in order to gather free ideas.

Looking for brutally honest insights on recruiting/hiring practices: Does this fourth round assessment indicate my chances are looking pretty good as candidate, or is it ever a practice to give these assignments to gather free ideas?

Many thanks for your responses!"
"Just a reminder, job recruiters WANT you to get the job. Feel free to ask them for advice.","This is only for third party recruiters. Some large companies have recruiters in house, and I'm not talking about that situation.

First of all, recruiters are legit. I thought maybe they were scams since someone contacting me for a job sounded too good to be true. That was a long time ago, and I've dealt with them a lot since then.

A recruiter's performance, and sometimes even pay, is largely dependent on them placing people in jobs. If you get the job, that's good for them as well.

I see questions on here all the time about interacting with recruiters. I'll drop a few notes I've heard/experienced directly from recruiters, but would love to hear other thoughts, and let me know if I'm wrong on any of this.

Ask recruiters about the hiring manager/position/what they're looking for. They'll be likely to give you some good details because as stated above, they're rooting for you. They've also possibly interacted with the hiring manager and have some details that aren't on the application. They might let you know really great details in your history you should mention in an interview.

Feel free to ask about pay. I hated bringing this up in an interview, but a recruiter won't mind. Also this could stop you from undervaluing the position when asked what you want to be paid. Also ask them any details you think might be deal breakers. No reason to spend a bunch of interviews not realizing you're gonna hate a job.

Recruiters are less likely to turn you down for something very minor. They may leave some things out speaking to the recruiter or even critique you.

Once you are out, they won't be afraid to let you know. A couple times I've just been ghosted, but feel free to ask where you are in the process. (again no recruiter is gonna throw you out as a candidate cause you emailed them one too many times)

If you don't want the job, tell them straight up. I don't know why but I used to be nervous about saying this like I was breaking up with someone. They don't want to waste time with someone not interested, so it's no big deal.

Try to keep in touch with them. Add them in LinkedIn or something. I've had them call me back a month later asking if I was still looking.

That's all I can think of.

EDIT: since this is in contest mode, I'm going to put the most common/best comments here since they won't rise to the top. The things I missed on are basically the negative, which exist. I think this is partially because recruiters for someone with 6 years+ experience is different from someone with very little experience.

A lot of recruiters don't look to far into candidates before reaching out. This means they'll contact you with jobs you'd clearly have no interest. Another reason to ask questions (salary) immediately

""They dont want you to get THE job they want you to get A job"" most probably don't care whether it's a good fit on either side which is why you should immediately start asking questions.

They will ghost you. Some (once you've got more experience I'd say) will want to keep in touch cause maybe they'll try again with you later. For some, once you're out of contention, you're useless to them, and they don't seemingly care about their reputation. I've even had an appointment set up and been ""stood up"" (only once)

There are absolutely bad experiences but... it's job hunting. This sub is incredibly negative, and it's hard to blame, BECAUSE job hunting sucks. I'd still say it's slightly less awful than other ways of job hunting.

I am not talking about staffing agencies. Those are totally different, have their uses, but also downsides."
I made a blunder with a recruiter by not realising I had already applied for the job directly,"Hi

About 20 days ago I was contacted by a recruiter for a role and they asked me if I had already applied and I said no and we went ahead with the process. A couple of days later as I was going through my application records I saw that I had indeed applied that role a day before the recruiter contacted me. I had completely forgotten about this as this company wasn't a big one and I had other companies on my mind. But here is where I really went wrong. Instead of letting the recruiter know as I soon as I realised I decided not to tell her because I assumed the CV I sent directly got lost in a sea of applications. I realise the error in this way of thinking but I just wasn't thinking properly. 

Anyway, I went ahead with the process through the recruiter and it got to the final stage interview. My final interview is on Monday and today I got a call from the recruiter saying they couldn't represent me as the company told them I had applied a day before. 

I feel awful for wasting the recruiter's time and making them look bad in front the company and I feel terrible about making myself look really bad in front of both the recruiter and the company. The recruiter isn't a major one in this country so I'm not too worried that being blacklisted by them is going to cost me a lot of future job opportunities although people's networks can be tight so who knows. And for the company I look foolish and disorganized at best and sneaky and selfish at worst. 

How do I handle this situation? I'm going to go back to the recruiter and confirm that I had applied and apologize for wasting their time. I haven't heard from the company directly yet and I'm too embarrassed to go ahead with the interview with the company (and to be honest this wasn't really a dream role anyway). Is there anything I can do?

Thanks"

Contacted by the same recruiter for another position.,"In the beginning of May I had an interview for an Analyst position.

"Recruiters, what are you views on Columbia University School of Professional Studies?","If someone apply for a position with a Master Degree from Columbia University School of Professional Studies, what are the chances of you giving them that job?

How would I ask a recruiter to find me a different position?,"A recruiting company helped me get a job as a contractor for a position back in September. The original contract was until January, then it was extended to April and now it’s been extended to August. When the pandemic started the company I am working for ended up letting go of 90% of the contractors and only kept a handful of us.

The pay is good, the people I work with are great, but it’s not really what I want to be doing and the management is horrible. I’m extremely thankful that I’ve been able to work, especially through the pandemic, but I am at the end of my rope with this company I am working for. If there was anything comparable, I would much rather be working elsewhere.

My question is, how would I bring this up to my recruiter without burning any bridges? Do I even bring it up under the current situation? I know I’m lucky to have a job in the first place, but honestly I’m so frustrated with my workplace that if there was an opportunity elsewhere, I want to take it.

My contract can be terminated at any time, by either party.

Any advice is greatly appreciated."
Applying to the same job from multiple hiring agencies?,"So somebody from a hiring agency contacted me about a job through Linkedin, which i sent them my resume for.

Does this sound like a scam?,"Today an 07 number contacted me about a customer service position that I don't remember applying to, saying that tomorrow I have a Zoom appointment with the managing director. The exact wording they use is ""Open Day Zoom Appointment"". I've applied to similar positions, but I can't find a confirmation email of my application, and the website looked completely foreign to me. The website didn't even show vacancies or really specify what they do, its just an outsource company.

Is there a way attending this Zoom appointment could be harmful to me in any way, or is it just a waste of my time if it is not genuinely a job I applied for but forgot about."
Staffing agency ghosting?,"Had a recruiter call me.

What’s a polite way to tell a recruiter to get to the point?,"When a recruiter contacts you (on LinkedIN) they always say how they were “pleasantly suprised to find your profile”, “how <company X> is an expanding company offering many opportunities” and “how you would be a perfect fit”. Then they always propose to schedule a call to “have an explorative conversation about my future”.

I get it. Recruiters are in part paid to be sympathetic and social people, and you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. But I don’t want to call every recruiter that comes knocking. On the other hand I do want to hear them out to see if this indeed could be an interesting opportunity for me. So what’s a respectful way to inquire about the salary, benefits and just to ask the recruiter to get down to the brass tacks of the job before we continue?

Thank you."
Position posted I'm interested in and qualified for....I already applied. Recuiter contacted me about it. Should I use them?,"A position was posted for a role I am interested in. A recruiter contacted me about this same position. What are the pros and cons of using them vs applying on my own?

Should I take tech recruiters seriously who are unprofessional and speak broken English?,"I am recently laid off so I have begun my job search as an Android mobile developer. After submitting my profile to a few job board I am receiving many calls and emails every day from recruiters who all seem the same:

* They have very heavy Indian accents, which makes it very hard to understand over the phone.
* Even after sending over my resume, they expect me to fill out a bunch of information that has already been provided to them in my resume (a few have even asked for the last 4 of my social security number).
* After calling some will them text me (a recruiter yesterday texted me in Hindi and English after a call)

Should I start not taking these recruiters seriously? I have never had one of these types of recruiters help me even land an interview.

Should I stop wasting my time with these types of recruiters?"
What does it mean when the recruiter tells me there's no interview needed and I just need to wait for a call to schedule a drug test and start date?,"Title, basically.

I sent in my resume, and she told me that there would be no interview needed. All I was told to do was to wait for a phone call to schedule a drug test and a few emails containing forms I needed to fill out. I was told after that I would be given a start date. The job listing was also taken off the website. Does this mean I have been hired, or should I still be looking out for other jobs? It's been about a week since the call."

How do you negotiate a salary for a W2 contract to permanent hire?,"I'm currently employed through a staffing agency in a contract W2 position. My manager at the company I work for recently told me that I will be hired directly by the company and he asked me to submit a salary request. I'm not really sure where to come in at, though?

Most of the information I've found online for folks moving from contract to permanent is for 1099 contract positions that offer no vacation, health insurance, or 401k match- and so by moving to permanent + those benefits, you can actually expect a decrease in salary. However- my staffing agency provides me with all of those things already- so I don't see how I could have a reduction in pay as is common in those other scenarios.

My thinking is that my company is likely paying the staffing agency my salary + at least 20%, so if I request my salary +10-15% more, me and my company would both win.

Does that sound like a reasonable approach? Or am I crazy to think I can expect an additional 10-15%?

Thanks!!"
A recruiter contacted me about a different job than the one I applied for,I'm testing the waters by applying for job opportunities that seem interesting. I applied for a job involving one set of skills through a recruiting agency in my field.

Should I mention that I applied for a different position or is there a better way to approach this without burning a bridge.
What are the chances that the person whose email I need to send my CV and cover letter to is the one who will read it?,"There is this job advert I want to apply to and the deadline is tomorrow. The advert says send the CV and cover letter to... and here is the email that basically looks like this: [name.lastname@company.co.uk](mailto:name.lastname@company.co.uk).

I found this company on LinkedIn and apparently they have less than 10 employees and I found the one from the email. He's been working there for 3 years but it says he's a software developer. Nothing about him being a recruiter or anything.

Is it possible that because the company is so small he is actually the recruiter? I feel like with such small companies, it should be the owner and it's definitely not him.

Is it safe to address my cover letter to him? Or should I do the unspeakable and address it ""To Whom It May Concern""? I know it's a bad thing but it worked last time I tried...

It's Saturday and no time to call the company or anything, I just found this advert and I wanna try."
Recruiter said they'd schedule an interview but didn't hear back yet,"A recruiter said he'd hand me off to another recruiter who works for the location I'm applying to. He said she'd call me soon yesterday to set up an interview and I said ""Alright, I'll be waiting"", but I still haven't heard from her today.

I've gotten calls for different jobs but this one pays really well, so I'm willing to wait. How long should I wait before I give up and pursue another offer? Should I bother asking him about when she'll call if I don't hear from her next Monday?"
Someone help me speak the language of Recruiter,"Been job searching for the past few months. After being unemployed since last October, and a concurrent part-time MBA student, I decided to switch to a full-time MBA schedule beginning in November of last year, and graduated 2 weeks ago. I've had some ""luck"" getting interviews, but have yet to receive any offers. One thing in particular that I am struggling with is the roller coaster ride of recruiter communications. Let me give you an example from this week.   


I'd gone through two separate rounds of interviews for two jobs last week. I thought both went well. As of Wednesday of this week, I had not yet heard anything regarding my status as a candidate. I decided to send a quick, friendly follow-up email to both of the internal recruiters from each company to inquire about my status as a candidate. Almost immediately after sending, I got a response from one of the recruiters saying something along the lines of, ""We must be telepathic, because I was just going to email you. We want to bring you to 2nd round of interviews. I'll be following up later today with more information. Look for an email later this afternoon asking for your schedule."" Been 2 days since this email and there's been no follow-up. How am I supposed to translate this?   


As for the other recruiter, haven't heard a peep. Been driving me bananas. This is not the first experience I've had with recruiters where communication seems a bit ""off"" and I'm sure it won't be my last. But I don't feel like I've quite yet learned how to translate what it means."
Does an employee recommending you to HR usually guarantee an interview?,"I had a great conversation with someone who works at a certain company and they recommended I apply to an open position on their team. I do not believe they are the team leader though. After I applied, I told the person about my application (as they asked me to) and they said they would let the recruiting center know. This person never said ""you will definitely get an interview,"" but they did say a few times something along the lines of ""I won't be the one interviewing you since we know each other"" and ""keep in mind when you are interviewing....""

I am keeping my expectations low--I personally just do not like the idea of expecting good things to come my way (especially when I've only done the bare minimum: submitted an application). However, I am curious if the language my contact used was because companies immediately advance people who have recommendations, or if it is simply their optimism speaking. If anyone knows or has been through this before, please let me know! Thanks in advance for any answers."
"Payload Rack Officer position, contacted by a recruiter AGAIN","So I interviewed this position in late October with CompanyA. I went through the interviews and down to the final interview with the managers at CompanyA, though the position that was offered changed to another, which was not a big deal for me since it was a IT related position. This was all possible because of the Recruiting CompanyB. Though I was not given the offer at the end, since CompanyA had an internal candidate that was more fit for the position. Now I get a call from another Recruiting CompanyC for the same position I applied to with CompanyA. Is CompanyA asking for candidates from these recruiting companies so they can promote employees internally, I’m confused."
How to deal with recruiters?,"TLDR: Is it bad to go around an external recruiter and apply for a position at a company directly?

Hi all, new to this sub. Looks like a good one to watch from here on, but came here specifically with the following question:

I've started looking for a new job recently and have started getting a lot of emails/Linkedin messages from recruiters. Not company recruiters, but recruiters that work for a recruiting company if that makes sense. Most of the offers so far are way off and don't at all pertain to me. I have just been replying with a polite I'm not interested right now, but will keep you in mind in the future type of message.

However, I have had some that are offering what I'm looking for. One in particular works for a recruitment company, but based on their linkedin profile seems to be tied with the company that she is offering positions for. This company is a big well known company that I would be thrilled to get a job for. I'm following through with the recruiter for the position that they brought to my attention, but there are numerous other positions on that company's website that would fit with me. Should I keep with the recruiter for those as well and just tell them I am applying for the other positions? Does going through a recruiter hurt your chances of getting a job?"
What do I say to employers,"Graduated as a registered nurse in 2017.

Are you still interested in this position?""

Has anyone countered this situation before?"
"What seemingly innocent questions can I ask recruiters, so that I can infer how their company's truly performing?","Because of COVID-19, due diligence requires me to *politely* question the future prospects, and in some cases, current under-performance of HR of companies who contact me. But HR always answers with just [meaningless corporate jargon or weasel words](https://redd.it/alzkov).  So what other seemingly innocent questions can I ask instead as a workaround proxy? 

These HR are legitimate, and prove their identity by emailing from their corporate address or allowing me to phone their  extension. I research Cash Flow, Income Statements, and Balance Sheets,  but accounting can be forged!"
Any service that uses your resume to find jobs for you?,"So, I am pretty busy with work and don't know the best way to search for jobs im qualified for.

I was wondering if anyone knew a service that did this for us and just setup interview and/or landed job offers?"
Why do recruiters keep ghosting me and sending me spam?,"I know recruiters are busy people, but it takes 30 seconds to look at someone’s profile and work out their level of experience and their job history.
I’ve had recruiters that reach out wanting to “know what you’re looking for” but giving no info about any specific opportunity, I’ve had recruiters offer me positions I am in no way qualified for, I’ve had recruiters ask for a CV and a time to call but never respond to my messages.
In one extreme example I had a recruiter reach out to me, after a brief text exchange he asked for a copy of my CV and for a good time to call the next day. I sent the CV and suggested a reasonable time and never heard anything. Six weeks later I got a new “I am working with some great clients” message from the same person asking for the information I had given him in the previous message.

I’ve seen recruiters complain about jobseekers and the way they are treated, I get you guys are VERY busy but to ghost job hunters or to send us messages that are effectively spam does not help. So why do you do it?"
Amazon Recruiting Q regarding 3rd-party recruiter policies for corporate jobs,"Hi r/jobs

TLDR: Does Amazon have a 6-month ban for recruiting applicants that had previously interviewed for but not been offered a job? Also, can 3rd-party recruiters not submit applications for candidates with open applications?

I just got off the phone with a 3rd-party recruiting company for Amazon regarding a corporate job. Interview went great until; 1) I was asked if I’m currently applying for any other roles at Amazon and 2) have I interviewed with Amazon in the last 6 months?

1) I have 3 open apps @ amazon.jobs for similar roles that have not been actioned by Amazon

2) I recently interviewed for an entirely unrelated role but was not selected (thankfully in hindsight)

The recruiter today told Me that I was not eligible for referral from him to the hiring manager because I had open applications and had recently interviewed for a role that I was not selected for.  

He also told me to withdraw my 3 other applications to see if he could get my application to the Hiring Manager he's contracted with.  

Does anyone know if these statements are true, and do you have any recommendations on a path forward?"
Do interviews care if you don’t do well with 1-2 questions of their list of 15-20?,"**interviewers 

Or do they really expect a decent answer with all of the questions they ask. Would messing up one answer make or break you if you did fairly well answering all the others?"
I got approached by a company owner to work for his insurance company.,"I work at a corner store and I received a call during work, ok the phone I got told that he was a customer and said he liked the service I provided earlier to him (which was a big guess because I might have not served him since there's a lot of workers here) anyways. He wanted to know if I was searching for a iob and I said yes.

We went on call and he provided me all the informations I needed, answered everything I needed to know and we got along pretty well. We even went on an app for screen sharing and he showed me a PowerPoint to know exactly what my job was and what to expect.

I reach for contract no salaries, pay per contract, he suggested to start with family and friends which I do not like but I'd work on my own advertisement. Offer insurance and I have a large library to choose from since we have access to all sorts of company's insurance from everywhere in the US and Canada. You probably know the drill even since this is probably common.

I pay for my class which is official and provided by the government, I did not get all the information yet (asked him if we could wait on that). Classes totals up to 500$ and I'd know about everything insurance and terminologies and I need it!

Worth it? 

Is it worth it? I'm a good salesman"
Puncutation Mistake in an Email to Interviewer,"This is probably a stupid post but I need to get this out of my head. So me and my interviewer were talking about scheduling up an interview and she asked me if I'm interested so I of course replied that I'm still very interested. So usually for my signatures, I just type ""Thank You"" and then my name under. This time I forgot to put a period after the ""Thank You."" How bad do you think this is and will it affect anything?"
would you email your HR manager on whether or not you are still going to be starting in August ?,"o recently, i got a job offer with a company that is going to be starting in August. 

And as a college graduate, it is really hard for me to find a job right now. So i am banking on this job offer quite a bit. 

a few of the people who were going to start in June had their job offers rescinded but I got in touch with one of the recruiting people and they told me that my job offer still stands for I start in August. However, that was back in march. 

considering the outlook of what things are looking like, and the lack of communication that im now getting with the company, should i consider getting back in touch with her ?

Graduating in May with Finance degree,"Hello, 

I’m just throwing a bone out on here if anyone has any leads to help my job search. Currently I’m a senior finance major at MSU and looking for a role in corporate finance in Chicago. Anything would be helpful thank you!! If you have actual leads or contacts I can discuss sending my resume over"
Absolute insane experience with recruiters. Need urgent help,"I live in Colorado and I've been actively looking for my first big developer job for the past month. I've had multiple interviews and multiple offers.

I narrowed my options down to 2 companies:

1. A contract to hire position with a technology that I'm excited about - via a recruiter
2. A DoD full time position that requires a Secret clearance - via the actual company

My priority was #1 and I've been constantly in touch with the recruiter. After my interview, he said everything is looking great, yet kept stalling on sending out an offer. He stalled for about a week.

While he was stalling, #2 offered me the full-time offer, which I eventually accepted. This role is contingent upon me getting the Secret clearance done, which could take anywhere from 1-3 months. It also seems to be a complicated process.

I called the recruiter and told him that I have an offer on the table and they need to hear back from me soon, so I asked him nicely to update me and try to speed up the process. He said he will.

Here is a timeline:

Day 1 - told the recruiter about the other position

Day 2 - recruiter did not answer phone call

Day 3 - recruiter did not answer phone call

Day 4 - recruiter answered phone call. I asked him about the position. He said it was filled.

Day 5 - I accept the #2 offer.

Day 6 - I find the actual email contact for the hiring manager at company #1 and thank him for his time and ask for feedback. He never replied.

Day 7 - The recruiter for #1 calls me and tells me that the hiring manager got in touch with him and told him that I contacted him. The recruiter then asked me if I would still be interested in filling up the role. I am very surprised. I asked him what happened with the other candidate. He said he might not work out. I ask him to tell me what the offer would entail and he says he will get back to me.

He calls me back an hour later and he said that I MIGHT receive an offer, but it is contingent upon me starting on MONDAY. The next business day. I tell him that it would be a very short time to make a decision and might be difficult to contact #2 and let them know about it.

After all, #2 is a full time position with plenty of benefits. #1 is a company that I was excited about, but it is a contract-to-hire (duration unknown, anywhere from 3-12 months) role. However, #2 could take months until I even start working there if all the paperwork gets done correctly. So here is my conundrum:

\#1 obviously has red flags in terms of its recruiters, but if I actually started on Monday, I can actually have income (I am currently unemployed). It does not seem like a stable position at all, however. I wouldn't feel comfortable rescinding #2, which seems to have a lot of security.

\#2 will probably take months until I can even start working there.

What do I do?

Technically, I could start #1 and get paid and get experience, and quit when #2 is ready. But what if I like it? By that point, #2 would have spent thousands of dollars on me getting cleared and onboarded. I don't think I could rescind #2 at that point. Also, the process for #2 might not take that long.

Do I just play it safe and focus on #2 and getting the process done and hope for the best in terms of the timeline? What if I don't get cleared and waste months without experience and income and miss out on the contract opportunity?

Do I rescind #2 knowing that the recruiters for #1 are shady to say the least and I'm not exactly sure what the actual company is expecting of me ?  The #1 position is also not full time and it doesn't have benefits, but it probably pays the same as #2 in terms of hourly.

The fact that the recruiter is trying to get me to start working on Monday is actually pretty insane. Especially after I showed continuous interest in the job and wanted to speed up the process and he ignored me and lied to me.  But after all, it's about me getting a job and experience.

So what do I do? The clock is ticking."
Rose International?,"Anyone have any experience with a recruiting firm called Rose International? I’ve gotten some bait from them over the past few days on Twitter, they appear to be a third party recruiting firm based out of India which legitimate companies use to recruit people for mostly temp office positions that require particular experience or skills. I can’t quite tell if it’s a scam or not, Google seems to indicate that there’s some legitimacy here, but that information can also be easily manipulated as well. I’m not necessarily interested in taking a chance with a temp role at the moment, but is it even worth it to respond to these people or is it a phishing trap?"
Todays job interview ruined my entire day and I feel so burnt out,"I had a phone interview today with a recruiter and she was late and never apologized or explained why she was late. After finishing all the questions, she quickly told me that I wasn't a good fit for this position as if she already made her decision before the interview. If so, why call me??! im so confused. im sad not cause i didn't get the job but because i was treated so poorly. people tell me that the industry is always like this and I have to understand how this works if i want to survive but that NEVER gives an excuse for people to behave this way.

its been almost 3 years of unemployment, hundreds of failed interviews and i just feel so tired guys. i don't know what to do anymore.

EDIT: oh wow i really didn't think i would get this many comments. thank you to everyone who has said kind words! and for those of who are asking: I just quit my part-time job so that I could focus a bit more on job hunting sorry i should've clarified that! to everyone that is in the same boat, good luck to all of us! you got this!"
What is working for Hermes actually like?,"Hi guys,

I live in West Wales and am 20 years of age. I am fully aware that business insurance will be a LOT higher for me until I reach 21 years of age but that's why I'm preparing now as that's in around 4 months time. I am really passionate about driving and am looking to hopefully do something in delivery, but need to be earning a sustainable amount of money. I applied for Hermes once and got a call asking for further details but I never got back to them after doing the sums, it was truly awful. I don't know if it's like this everywhere but based on what I've heard, this is what I can approximate.

Income:

50p per parcel (assume 100 parcels per day, 12 parcels an hour approx means 5 minutes between deliveries, seems about right). That's £50 in income, or a gross rate of £6.25/hr.

Outgoings:

Assume the cost of running a car is 35p a mile. With business insurance, that is roughly what it would be I'd imagine. Where I live, as things are pretty far away from each other (quite rural). I would assume that over 8 hours of driving I'd cover around 150 miles a day, which would mean an average speed of 19mph which seems about right given my experience of driving where I live.

So, 150 miles at 30p per mile, is £45

Total income for 8 hours work = (£50-45) = £5 or... 63p per hour.

I have heard of Hermes SE+, which supposedly you trade in some of your per package income for a stable pay rate. Does that sound any better or does anyone have experience with it? If the income is so bad as I have calculated, why am I still getting deliveries via a hermes courier?

Just looking for some insight, cheers."
Call tomorrow with a recruiter from a major company,"I have a call tomorrow with a recruiter to talk about the job opening. I haven’t actually applied yet but it seems to be what I’m looking for. Just curious if this is considered an interview, or what I should be preparing for? Thanks"
What do recruiters see when I apply,"I have a question for in-house recruiters. Once I click submit on my application, it goes into the proverbial black hole. What do you see on your end when you finally get to looking at applications for a particular posting? What are your strategies when using the ATS to determine which applicants to call? What ATS software do you use? One recruiter posted on r/resumes about the back end of indeed and it got me curious about the back end of other systems."
"Recruiters reached out and I THINK they assume I'm a programmer. I still want a job there, but just not as an engineer. How can I be honest without getting ghosted after?","I'm jumble-brained right now so I'll bullet point my thoughts:

* My LinkedIn says things about me developing an app and also lists some coding certifications.
* I ""understand"" some programming languages BUT I'M NOT A PROFICIENT CODER.
* Two ENGINEERING recruiters from big companies reached out and used terms such as ""your iOS experience.
* I'm PRETTY SURE they think I'm an engineer \[don't know though because I didn't reply back yet\].
* Don't get me wrong, I'm a ""technical"" guy and I'd love to build the app I'm working on...but I know my place...I'm just the business / idea guy
* I want to be honest with them if they ask me about coding, but I don't want to scare them away because I'd still love the opportunity to work at those companies as another position.

My question:

* What should I say if I want a job, but they're looking for an engineer?"
Should I tell recruiters that I am currently in the process of searching for jobs with other recruiters?,"At the moment, I have multiple applications running at the same time with multiple recruiters, in hopes that I will be hired for at least one. Would it be a good idea to let each of them know of what I am doing? If I am offered multiple positions(a very unlikely if), I want to be able to have a few days to decide which one to accept. 

I also want to avoid a situation such as accepting an offer, then being given another offer by the other recruiter afterwards, one that I might prefer more."
How do you write a good cover letter for an internship position?,"Some background:

I’m an undergraduate student from Canada majoring in Economics and I’ve just competed my third year of a four year program. Although I’ve had several summer jobs in the past, I’ve never been able to get a position related to my field. I have a decent GPA (B+) and I’ve had my resume proof read by the career development office at my university. 

Over the past couple of months I’ve applied for 15+ positions for this upcoming summer and I haven’t been contacted for an interview. 
I try to personalize each cover letter, and specifically explain why I’m a good fit for the position skill wise. I know a big part of the reason I haven’t received any interviews is my lack of professional experience outside of the academic environment, but it seems you need experience to get experience.

I’m hoping some recruiters or experienced professionals can provide me with some insight on a good format for a cover letter and what kind of information to include when all you have is academic experience. Thanks in advance!"
I want to renegotiate my hourly pay with a recruiter a month into my new job,"I have been actively looking for a job a month ago. I was presented with a couple of offers, but I had an interview that I enjoyed that was set up via a recruiting agency.

After my interview, I was talking to my recruiter for 1-2 weeks trying to speed up the process. I got other offers and I told him about them and hoped that he would speed the process up for me to make it easier for me to make a decision. One of the offers was for $36/hr but it required me to relocate, which I preferred not to do at the moment (I did not tell him that I would have to relocate but told him about the pay)

He said that his job pays 36$ as well and that I should just wait a couple of more days.

I then received another offer, for $38, and told him about it. However, I told him that I am still interested in his position because once again, I enjoyed the interview and could see myself as a good fit.

The recruiter ghosted me for a week. Stopped answering phone calls, texts. I had given up.

Eventually, he picked up the phone after a week. He told me someone else had filled that position. I contacted the company that I would work for through the recruiting agency DIRECTLY and the people there told me that they would have been excited to work with me, but they were told that I had already accepted another job offer. 

Two days later. on a Friday, the recruiter called me and told me that I could still get the job if I wanted to. I had other offers on the table but told him that I could still be interested. I told him that I'm willing to entertain a potential offer.

The recruiter told me there was a catch - I would have to accept it that Friday night and show up to work on Monday - which was actually an insane condition. However, I needed a job and needed it fast. I said ""Okay, I'll work with you""

The offer came in at $31. I told him that I was expecting him to keep his word and offer me the $36, but he used the typical recruiter excuse ""It came in lower than I expected"". I know they are getting a huge chunk of what the company is paying for me.

Anyways, I'm a month in and have done an excellent job so far. However, I'm still wanted by other companies - and here's a thing that I saw as a red flag: Even though there is an ongoing pandemic, the company refused to let me work from home even though my job is technical and can be performed remotely. 

I feel like I have nothing to lose and I also feel like I'm terribly underpaid for the tasks that I'm doing.

Can I give my recruiter an ultimatum of keeping his original promise and renegotiating my pay or else I'd be moving on to other prospects?

I would have nothing to lose if I went to a new job. However, the recruiting agency would lose money by losing me, so I feel like it doesn't hurt to try.

I want to ask for the original $36 that I was promised. Or else.

Thoughts?"
Should I tell my recruiter?,"Tl;dr: Should I tell my recruiter about a (high paying) job that I was pursuing even though I didn't get it? Will the recruiter relay that information to the company to hopefully help with a better offer?

I have been working a job through a staffing agency for 2 months. The pay is really low for me but I needed something, as I told my recruiter, and that I wasn't planning on staying longer than 3 months without a good job offer in the company. He checked in with me every week and I could hear him typing notes as he feigned interest. I always said that the company is good but at the end of the day, I have to have something better. He always replied with there isnt anything (which before all this, I dont know how much I could believe) and to tell him if I had any opportunities come up. 

I came close to a job but didn't get it due to another candidate having more experience in the field. I never told him because I thought it would make it weird at my job knowing that I was trying to go elsewhere or that it would affect his commission so he'd try to keep me where I am. This is my first time dealing with a recruiter. 

Today, I had a chance to talk to my boss at the company saying despite all this going on in the world, that I was wondering if there was discussion of bringing me on board. He said yes but we just haven't had time to sit down with you yet, which I understood. I followed that up with the fact that I need a big bump in pay for me to consider it. We left it at that."
Is this typical practice of a recruiter?,"Bear with me, I’m providing details for context. 

I interviewed with a company that I fell in love with last year. The hiring manager emailed me personally to tell me that I lost out to an internal candidate, but I’d be a great fit at the company, and she “strongly encouraged” me to keep applying, and that she would keep me in mind if a spot opened on her team. I kept applying with no luck, and sent her a follow up email months later restating my interest. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks ago. I get an email from her with a direct reply to my follow up email, telling me a spot opened on her team, and that I should apply and that she would flag my resume with internal corporate recruiter. I did, and he emailed me to schedule a phone interview. 

Had the phone interview last week, nailed it, and he told me that the hiring manager (not the director who emailed me, but the lead manager below her) might want to skip the phone interview with me and just bring me in, since his boss (that emailed me and whom I interviewed with last year) already tagged me, and I already interviewed with so many directors of departments that I would be interacting with last year. 

He told me (unprompted by me) that he was speaking with hiring manager on Friday, and that he would reach out to me either Friday or Monday the latest to let me know the interview schedule, as they are moving quickly.  I heard nothing, so yesterday morning I sent an email to follow up, asking for a status update. He never returned my email. 

It’s 2020. I have a computer on my wrist. I work at a big Corp and am also very busy with emails, meetings and life, but if I tell someone I will contact them, and they email me, I take the literal 2 seconds to respond and tell them if there’s a delay, someone is on vacation, whatever. 

Is this typical practice to ignore someone in a situation like this?  What should my next steps be?"
How do I get employers to communicate by email or text?,"This happens to me constantly, an employer will start a conversation by email or text then just randomly call me. I just had one that texted me and I texted back I would like to set up an interview and talk. Then 30 minutes later they just randomly call me. I can’t stop everything I’m doing and have a 30 minute conversation with someone. I’m working and it’s much easier to email or text. How do you stop these random calls when you haven’t even set up an interview? It’s really annoying to me.

Edit: When they call, they don’t leave a message either. I have to debate do I call them back or what at that point."
How long should I wait to contact recruiter again?,"This monday, my recruiter called me to say that my information was being processed. I am supposed to receive a call at some point to schedule a drug test, after which I'd be given a start date. I was told to call her back if I didn't get that call by wednesday, but when I did so, I got no response. I tried again on thursday, and once again got no response, and since her voicemail box hadn't been set up, I left a text message to call me back when possible. I'm a bit concerned about what is happening. Should I wait to try calling back again in a full week, or should I do so sooner? 

I presume that because of the pandemic there is significant slowdown in the hiring process, so I understand the delay, I suppose I posted this to simply relieve my stress a bit."
Question regarding pharm sales transferring to med sales career?,"I spoke to a hiring agent of a med sales job. He’s a Vice President at a med sales company and I asked him a few questions with some career advice for someone getting started into med sales.

He told me that med sales recruiters tend to avoid prior pharmaceutical sales reps when they’re thumbing through applications for a med sales rep job. He said seeing them have pharmaceutical sales experience makes med sales reps more reluctant to hiring them because they feel like they’ve had their career “handed to them” since pharmaceutical sales tend to have a higher guaranteed base salary. 

To me this sounds a bit discriminatory and i don’t want to ruin my chances getting a med sales job because I have pharmaceutical sales experience.

Is this true? Would this be discrimination?"
I’m graduating from college and am worried about employers seeing my social media,"I’m graduating in a month and am applying for jobs currently. My Facebook, Instagram, Twitter are all fine in terms of an employer seeing them. My concern is that since I’ve started quarantining I’ve become obsessed with TikTok. I know I’m a child haha. I couldn’t help but come up with ideas and film some of my own. Unfortunately for me I love to drop f bombs and make dick jokes. My TikTok is not my real name and the only thing it is linked to is my phone number. I really care about finding a job but I’m also so bored and love making funny videos. What are my chances of an employer finding these? Thanks in advance!"
What do I do when my temp recruiter does not respond for my inquiries to move to a new job?,I have been temping with the same company for well  over two years. The assigned company will not hire me full time. They also do not want me to leave either and have been telling me for a while that a new job will eventually pop up for me to apply to. Because of this I've asked my recruiter if I can change jobs and she refused to respond to my requests. Do recruiters not want you to leave your placement?
Any Advice for a CCAT?,"I’m in the running for a Sales Specialist position at a decently well-known company. I feel like I really crushed the first phone interview, the recruiter said he was going to pass me along to the next round before I could even try to “close” him. 

Part of the next step is having to take a CCAT, a cognitive assessment standardized test. I feel like I’m a decently smart guy, a great communicator, but I am nervous about standardized testing. I haven’t done a test since high school and I didn’t exactly excel.

Has anyone else had to take one of these? Any advice? I know I can nail the verbal and language stuff, but my math and spatial reasoning needs some work but I feel like those aren’t as imperative to sailed."
Question: Working with more than 1 recruitment agency for positions in same company?,"Hi, hope I used the right flair. I'm in a bit of a dilemma. So first off, I'm not very familiar with working with recruitment agencies so I'm not sure what the usual etiquette is. Omitting some details for confidentiality. **TLDR at the bottom**

&nbsp;

I had my resume and details uploaded to a job board for a while, and a few days ago, Agency A reached out to me and said I seemed to be a good fit for a job, X, at a large company. Note that I didn't apply for the position before Agency A reached out to me. Now this company is... definitely known nationwide, and they're very prominent in their field. 

&nbsp;

I was able to talk with Agency A a few days ago, about the position and other details. For where things are now, Agency A has forwarded my information to the hiring manager of the company, and are waiting to hear back. The next step, if the hiring manager approves, is an onsite interview. Overall Agency A seems to be larger and has been around longer, has more reviews, but seem to be based in a different state.

&nbsp;

But today around the afternoon, I got a call by Agency B... for a slightly different position, but at the same exact company and same location - **However**, at the time I applied, their listing didn't say the name of the company - they just said the location of the position. I applied to the position via Agency B *before* I first talked with Agency A on Wednesday. Agency B is smaller and newer, but unlike Agency A they're local to the general area they recruit for. 

&nbsp;

In my call with Agency B, **that's** when they told me ""The position's at (large company)"". I could've gleaned that from context clues in their listing but wasn't 100% sure. But TBH, I wasn't expecting to hear back from Agency B because I applied through them before and never heard back.

&nbsp;

I googled around and most people are saying that it's not a good idea to have multiple recruitment agencies represent you for positions in the same company... aka double-dipping. The two positions are in the same department I think but not exactly the same, so I'm imagining that the recruiters would be talking with the same hiring manager, which after googling is not a good idea and the hiring manager would likely get confused about who is actually representing me. But since the company is so large, I'm wondering if that would make any difference vs. if it were a smaller company where the hiring manager for sure would be the same?

&nbsp;

I'm just not sure how to proceed with things... do I tell both agencies? Do I stick with one agency and drop the other? AhhHHh. I just don't want to accidentally end up burning bridges with anyone.

&nbsp;

**TLDR**:

-Agency A got to me first for the position at a large company by finding my resume through a job board

-I applied to Agency B *before* I talked with Agency A

-I wasn't aware at the time which company Agency B was recruiting for until they called me

-I got a call back from Agency B *after* I already talked with Agency A and got things rolling

-Agency A and Agency B are recruiting for the same exact company

-The positions are slightly different but chances are very high they're in the same department with the same hiring manager

-... What should I do now?


Thank you for reading and for any advice!"
Can I look for temporary work while currently signed to a contract?,"So a little over a month ago, I was contacted by a recruiting agency that said they were looking for someone that was in my field for a new job. I went and did the interviews and got the job. I'm currently still a college student and this was basically like an internship with the possibility of becoming a full time job. I was very excited because I never had a job in my field before. But as of last week because of the pandemic people were furloughed and since I was on a contract for the recruiting agency I am basically just not working any hours and not getting paid because my contract was hourly. The recruiters told me that as soon as we could they would love to have me come back to the position immediately, but I don't know how long that is going to be. Basically my question is am I allowed to apply and potentially get hired for another remote position while I am still signed by the recruiting agency? I would very much like to get back to work as I am incredibly bored and my semester is just about done. I am looking for work in IT/Cybersecurity."
Recruiter asking me to lie on my resume?,"Hi, I've got a quick question that I could use some help with:

I applied for a job as a Junior Technical Writer at some sort of tech company, and a recruiter from this company just contacted me asking for an updated resume.
 
I sent him my resume, which hasn't changed since I initially applied for the job, but he responded saying that the job requires some sort of technical writing experience (which I don't have) and to please send him an updated resume indicating that I have technical writing experience.

Basically, it sounds like he wants to me fabricate some sort of position where I worked as a technical writer. Could this backfire for me? Why can't we just be honest about my lack of experience? 

I would appreciate any quick replies, I'm supposed to talk to his manager in about 3 hours and I don't know what I'm going to do. I already feel suspicious because the recruiter tried to low-ball me during our initial phonecall, offering me a wage less than the advertised amount."
S-Oil Corp Recruitment?,"Hi guys, just wanted to check in here to see if anyone has come across this company or have been contacted by any of their recruiters about an offer to become a consultant for their US Investors.

It's with a company called S-oil Corporation, and they claim that this is a position that can be taken on without having to leave my current job. Is this a common thing? 

I wanted to take precautions and was curious if anyone else has run into something like this. They've contacted me via email that was listed on LinkedIn, and their HR manager's signature and information looks legitimate."
Phone screen follow up?,"Hi all, 

Had a phone interview/screen not last Friday but the Friday before and haven’t heard anything back from the recruiter. The recruiter didn’t give me any concrete dates or timelines for next steps, just outlined what the next steps were and that she’d flag my profile for both hiring managers/teams and go from there. I know with COVID19 a lot of things are on hold but it’s also a tech company. Thoughts? When is it okay to reach out?"
Should I tell the recruiter for my first choice company that they're my first choice?,"I currently have a stable job (thank goodness; I feel really lucky amidst this craziness) but it's seriously wearing at me and I intend to leave. 

Yesterday, a recruiter from AWS reached out to me on LinkedIn regarding a position which, according to Glassdoor, pays about 88% of what I'm making now. AWS is my first choice and I'm hoping to apply to a different position with them that would pay slightly more than what I'm making now and for which I'm suitably qualified.

I have a couple of questions that I'd love to hear this sub's thoughts on:

1. How do I best leverage the recruiter having reached out to me for a job other than the one I want? 
2. Does it hurt my eventual negotiating position to tell them that they're my first choice, but I'm not interested in the position they're trying to fill? 
3. Both positions would be in the same part of AWS (public sector consulting), so is it likely that the recruiter would already be aware of the position for which I intend to apply?
4. I'd rather not take a 12% pay cut, but is it worth it to get in the door?"
Advice for following up with a recruiter,"I am a mechanical engineer. I have been in contact with a recruiter from a company I am interested in. We have had a pretty steady back and forth email chain discussing potential opportunities with the company, and he has shown genuine interest in helping me find a position there. I haven't heard from him in about a week. I'm assuming he, and the company, are dealing with the fallout from coronavirus, quarantine, etc.

I want to send a follow up email to show I'm still interested, while still showing understanding about the situation we're all in. Below is the draft I have so far. I would appreciate any advice/feedback on how I might revise or rewrite this. Thank you in advance.

""Hi \[recruiter\],

I understand that this is a difficult time and that hiring processes may be disrupted due to the preventative measures taking place. In the meantime, please let me know if I can help in any way.

I hope all is well.

Sincerely,

\[me\]"""
Is is too early to chase up my recruitment consultant?,"I had a long call with a RC on the 7th where he had said there are 3 positions that he wants to put me forward for. One is actively recruiting during the pandemic and the other two will be needing someone in the next couple of months (I have a long notice period).

I've not heard anything since so is it too early to chase him up? We also just had the 4 day BH weekend so I can't imagine he was working much then as my industry is very white collar finance. 

If it's too early now, when should I get in contact?"
"""Are you willing to relocate?"" = ""Do you mind if I ghost you forever?""","Since we don't have the Megathreads anymore, I'll just start posting my short disappointments in my own topics, I guess.

On the 24th, a recruiter contacted me and said ""I saw you applied for the C++ programmer position. When are you free to discuss some details?""

I said ""I'm available most of the day, between about noon and midnight, so feel free to call whenever it suits your schedule.""

They replied ""Perfect, I will email you in a few hours to setup [sic] a call. Are you in Austin?""

I said no, and they asked ""Are you willing to relocate?"" and I said yes, of course, ""I can move at any time.""

The end.

(Yeah, it seems like there should be more to this story, like the part where we actually have the phone conversation *he* contacted *me* about, but there isn't. He never got back to me after that)"
Pushy Recruiter,"Hey all

I've been unemployed since December and have been hitting the road looking for jobs. A recruiter contacted me and asked if I would be interested in a position. Naturally I said yes while also applying for positions on my own.

I have now received offers from both the recruiter company and one I applied for myself. However, the recruiter is trying to guilt trip me into her job - You're trying to stall, you won't get more, I've worked hard to get you this etc.

Has anyone dealt with this before?  This is honestly the worst part of the job hunt moreso because I don't really like confrontation.

Thanks for reading"
Was invited for an interview for a remote job,"As a Technical Write for Emerson Croft, though it is remote. They sent an overview of what to expect and on of the things that raised red flags for me is:  

They don't have a an immediate need in creating a website for that part of the US or becoming public.  

They don't have ""Employees"", they have ""Consultants"".  

Not list the company on any social media (even though a friend who works for the affiliate in out country can do it.  

The contract doesn't include social security, paid vacation or sickness leaves, nor it includes medical care coverage.  

Employees are solely responsible for making all the necessary tax payments that his country's legislation requires them to.  

Is it a scam? Seems pretty legit, but it's weird how they don't offer medical insurance.  

Any advice?"
Contacting Recruiters on LinkedIn,"There is a company I am really interested in doing an internship at, but I want to get in touch with a recruiter as well as applying online in the hopes of increasing my chances of hearing a response back.

I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to message recruiters out of the blue on LinkedIn to show that I have a real interest in working at their company and would be a great fit."
"External Recruiter represented me in interview process but we realized a complication due to my previous application, how to proceed","I applied to a company through an external recruiter this month and have progressed somewhat far in the process but have not received an offer. There is still another 2 rounds of interview stages to go.


I had disclosed my previous familiarity with this prospective company with the external recruiter but did not mention that I applied directly 6+ months ago, because I did not think it was relevant (since at my current company I think it is a 3 month rule). Back then, I interviewed at the initial HR stage but did not progress further. I had received a fairly standard ""unfortunately there were lots of qualified applicants blah blah"" rejection email.


The external recruiter let me know today that my previous application complicates his ability to represent me. I have been in direct contact with the prospective company, and I've been relaying communications with the recruiter as well. The company wants to continue this direct contact with me.


The external recruiter and I have been in contact since mid-December about this position so understandably he may be very upset. 


What is the best solution here? Obviously I want to maintain a good relationship with both the prospective company (since I would like to continue to move forward in the interview process) and the external recruiter. I most likely wouldn't be where I am in the interview process without the recruiter help (since I wouldn't have re-applied)."
How to find recruiters to work with?,"I’m on the job hunt.  I never really utilized my college’s resources well for career counseling in school, so I feel at a loss with any kind of strategy. I worked with a wonderful woman who helped me put together a stellar resume, and I know I need to tailor my cover letter to each company I apply to. But I just feel at a loss of what to do. I studied mathematics in college (B.A. degree) because I was absolutely in love with the subject. I didn’t take very many applied courses and I am regretting that so much now. I have no idea what direction to go in. I’m willing to try just about anything. But a big caveat is that I have a compromised immune system so with everything happening globally and locally I would like to be able to work from home for the time being, or within a non-public space (was previously working retail). I don’t know anything about working with recruiters, but this keeps popping up in different conversations and online. Could this be helpful? What does this entail? I just don’t know what to do right now. Any and all advice helps. Thank you in advance!"
Acceptable forms of contact,"I have a question for recruiters. My resume is posted on several job boards as well as my LinkedIn. I get several calls a week from recruiters about positions that they are trying to fill. I would appreciate if I got an email first with a brief summary of how they found me, the position and industry of the job they have in mind, and asking to schedule a time to talk. Some of the opportunities they call about are not relevant to my skills/experience/career interests and it would save my time, as well as theirs if I could simply respond to an email stating that the position is not a good fit. My question is, what is a professional way to convey to recruiters that I wish to be contacted by email first?"
Is it customary to write a thank-you e-mail after a phone screen/introductory call?,"(The time has passed for this, but) I was contacted by a senior recruiter for a job maybe 1-2 weeks ago. Interviews would start next week; haven't heard back. There are a few reasons why that could be, but I'm wondering if I should've followed that up with an e-mail thanking her for her time.

Also, are phone screens really that effective? They give me false hopes as a prospective employee :("
Will it rub a recruiter the wrong way if I ask for a speedy start to hiring process?,"I'm in final round interviews but some jobs I've applied to are just contacting me for phone screens. An in house recruiter reached out to me and after I said I was interested, sent me a calendly link for a phone screen next week Friday. Is it arrogant to mention ""hey I'm in final round interviews?"" I mentioned this to a hiring manager at the end of a call 3 days ago, and its the first time I haven't moved past the phone screen so I'm wondering if I shouldn't have said anything. 

I'm not trying to flex that I have interviews, but in that previous circumstance, they mentioned the next step is a few weeks away so I felt I had no choice. Should I wait until the second round to bring it up? Maybe from the initial call they would feel like they are plenty of fish in the sea, but once they get attached they would be receptive to accelerating the process?"
Saying no to a candidate when they have more interviews scheduled?,"Hey all,

So, say a candidate has 7 interviews scheduled but after 3 everyone agrees it's a no. How do you handle this? What would you tell to the candidate?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: thank you all for your thoughts! To clarify, I’m referring to a situation when a senior person has 1 day of interviewing, only with different people, managers, peers, so it’s technically multiple meetings. 

As someone in the comments said, some of these are more for the candidate to figure out if they want to work there just as much as it is for the company. It needs to be a match on both ends."
Is it quite weird to send the recruiter with the updated resume?,"I recently got referred through one of my contacts to a recruiter, but they happened to have forwarded the resume of mine which is old, will it be odd if I reach out the recruiter saying that I've attached the updated version of my resume and wanted them to have the same, or something along the lines?"
Is it okay to just not return a call for phone screening/interview?,"I've been testing the water around my area with applications, a lot to places I don't actually care for like retail and fast food and would probably be miserable working at. I've gotten a few calls from these places asking if I could call them back for some questions and stuff. What are the consequences of not doing so? Do I get blacklisted? Will they remember my lack of return call months down the line if I actually need a job there?"
Multiple Recruiters For Company I Applied For?,"This is my second time applying for the same position and the first time I had a different recruiter who has now moved up the corporate ladder. 

It’s been almost 2 weeks since I’ve submitted my application, the job posting has been open for a month and I have two inside sources that say that the position desperately needs to be filled. 

I’d like to give the process a boost, if I could, to try and score an interview, but I don’t know which recruiter to email.  They have 3 listed on LinkedIn that reside in the headquarters location but usually one is specific to a certain branch though I have no idea who it is. 

They have a Senior Recruiter, a Lead Recruiter, and a Junior Recruiter. Which one should I go for if any?"
"If a potential employer says ""lets explore opportunities"" does that mean they might be interested in hiring me or are they just being polite?","I met this manager 6 months ago (I don't work for him) and I was interested in the job his team does so I asked him if we can meet so that I can learn about what they do. We met and had a great conversation. He told me if I'm ever interested in potentially joining his team I should email him. So fast forward 6 months later, my current contract at my current job is ending and I'm looking for a new job. I email this manager and say a bunch of things as well as re-send my resume just in case he lost it and finished the email with ""I would love to chat and learn about potential opportunities on your team"" and he said hes happy I reached out and he wants to do a meeting with me, him and another manager and THEN we can explore opportunities.

Does his response seem like he might have a job in mind for me? or is this just a way to be polite? Mainly I just want to know if that type of response is usually considered positive or neutral. I'm getting a little stressed that I won't find a new job

thanks for any answers"

Lost out on job opportunity b/c recruiter went on vacation. What lessons should I learn?,"A seemingly perfect job came up that I am extremely well qualified for. A recruiter told me not to apply for it because she would put my resume directly into the hands of the decision-maker. I didn't hear anything for a couple of days, so I emailed her to check in. I got her out office: on vacation for over two weeks. Now the job is closed. And even tho the recruiter is back at work, I haven't heard from her.

What lessons should I walk away with here? I didn't apply because I heard employers hate getting a resume thru the normal application process that they also got from a recruiter. Next time, should I just apply? Do these things happen sometimes or should I quit working with this recruiter?"
Recruiter reaching out to me about a position I don’t have much experience in,"Hello,

Today a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn about a position as a Project Manager at a company that does space stuff. I’ve only been a project manager for a theatre production so I was wondering if the recruiter might have just not know that when they reached out to me. I have a technical background in Physics and have always wanted to work in the space industry (I did the theatre production gig because I thought that would be fun to do too). I just didn’t want to get my hopes up if he accidentally messaged me, haha. 

It might be worth it to mention that my friend has been trying to start up a company in the space industry as well (company is currently in stealth mode and I haven’t gotten anything in writing yet in terms of employment), so I have experience in spacecraft systems engineering. I don’t think I can mention this in my resume (since it’s not official and my friend won’t be a reference).

I guess my question is, do I actually have a chance at being a competitive candidate?"
Dealing with job offers.,"Hello everyone I just got accepted for my first big boy job. Now that this offer is on the table I am ""valuable"" since my current employer who didn't want to promote me now wants to counter the other parties offer. However, I have a second potential job that I've been waiting to hear back from for a while now. Whenever I message the recruiter all they say is that they will get back to me when they have an offer... The hiring manager told me that he'd have an offer about three weeks ago... My question is, should I let them know that I have an offer on the table? Would this be a smart thing to do?"
A recruiter contacted me on linkedin - I am a little skeptical,"Yesterday a recruiter got in touch with me on LinkedIn out of the blue. She said she had an opportunity at a client company (which is a big one in my field) and that mostly matches my skills.  


It seems legit enough, I could easily find the company she works for in google and I looked her up in some social media and she is a legit person. However, I got a little skeptical as she did not ask for my portfolio and this is an artistic role.  


Also, I am a recent graduate and this would be my first job in the field.

Maybe I am just being paranoid, but idk..."
Do you bother with firms that have a bad reputation on the review websites?,"So I get contacted through job websites but as it stands most firms who approach me have worrying reviews online. The last job I took had all points listed on a review that were problematic for me as well so I feel like I should listen more to those reviews. Yet again maybe I should see for myself. Basically I don’t want to waste my time but I’m also unemployed. How do you go about it?

For reference, the last firm to contact me sounded interesting as it actually matched my qualifications. But from the reviews the culture is hell, pay is low, people are leaving. There are no follow ups from the company on those reviews, no „we’re sorry you feel that way and constantly striving to be better bla bla“. Looks to me like they don’t care and just cram in new graduates like me who supposedly don’t know better."
Missed calls/ calls not being returned,"I haven’t posted here in awhile, but need some advice. I keep getting calls from employers, they leave a message and ask me to call. I call them back and never hear back from them. I work evenings doing deliveries for Grubhub and DoorDash. I can’t really have a phone conversation at the time.  I call back the next day in those circumstances. Sometimes they call during the day and I call them back as soon as I get up. What can I do short of constantly being awake and glued to my phone? This is getting really annoying.


Edit: This is why I like communicating through email or text to set up the initial interview."
"Good employment agencies, how do you find them?","I've had a decent amount of contact with job agencies in my two years since college, and the way they operated always made it feel like they were scamming me or teasing me. So I generally developed the attitude of disregarding them as a way to find a job.

However now I'm having a hard time finding a job and someone whose opinion I respect recommended using an employment agency. I did a little research and it seems like the trick is finding a good one and sticking with them, because there are a lot of bad ones just trying to make money off you. Similar to how you should find a good mechanic and stick with them.

But how do you go about finding a good one?"
Is submitting an application to the same job multiple times bad?,"Hello, I'm in the process of applying to internships, and I feel like I might have made a mistake on my application. In reality, I probably didn't, and this is just my anxiety kicking in but I wanted to ask the recruiters and senior-level employees in this subreddit what they thought of someone submitting an application twice. If it isn't a big deal, I'd like to submit all my apps one more time just for sanity sake."
It of state resume follow up [bos to phx],"Currently I live in Massachusetts but I'm looking to relocate to the Phoenix area. 

In my field (construction) I have experience, but I haven't heard back from any submitted applications. The one I DID hear back from one, it was because I called to follow up. That landed me an interview. Unfortunately the particular job area I applied for isnt as strong there as it is here.. would've had the job but terrible pay.

Knowing this, I've slightly changed the areas I apply too, still equally qualified for. Back to hearing nothing.

After searching thru older threads I've seen a split some say, dont contact at all, some say only after an interview, some say always follow up to separate yourself.

I do know that when I called on that previous offer, they had trouble finding my application at first. Then noted a sorting system used to help weed through resumes, and that it more than likely picked up on my location and deemed me not suited for the position.

Am I to believe there is no solid right or wrong when it comes to follow up etiquette? However, when it comes to people in my position, it's important to follow up? 

Thanks"
Do recruiters send you to interviews knowing you don't have a chance?,"I got a couple interviews through a recruiter who told me something interesting.  He said the company told them to send four candidates, but they didn't intend to submit four rockstars - they would send two of their best candidates, and two fillers, to make the best candidates look better.

He assured me I wasn't one of the fillers, but I assume he'd say the same thing to the fillers themselves, so for all I know I was one of those.  Made it to a second interview though, so who knows.

Does anyone else have any experience with this situation?"
Is the recruiter lying to me or am I overthinking things?,"I got a text from a recruitment agency  asking me to call the recruiter.  Before I called I checked my email and I saw that I was sent a role and the job spec has the start date and end date on it as well as the typical spec stuff. 

It looked like a good role so I called back immediately to discuss the role only for the recruiter to tell me she can’t answer my questions and I should put it in an email and they’d respond when they speak to the client. 

Please bare in mind that one of the questions I asked was about the start and end date for the role because it seemed like she changed her mind about representing me.  I think it’s weird that she suddenly cannot answer me but the email says that their are short listing candidates in a couple of hours for the role. 


Am I being paranoid or is she lying?"
Looking into using a recruiter. Where do I begin the search for a quality recruiter?,"So I’m currently employed and love my company. But we are in the midst of a merger/acquisition. As the finality of the merger gets closer I’m starting to feel uncertain that they will keep my team around. With all the “up in the air” feelings around the office, I’ve found that many on my team have already begun their search.
Since I still have a heavy workload I don’t have a lot of time to give toward a job search.
Curious if anyone has tips on finding a quality recruiter that can help me with a Sales/Business Development job search ideally healthcare related. When I look for one, the market is real saturated.
Any direction would be helpful!"
Got terminated and then two recruiter added me on LinkedIn of the same company?,"I got terminated during my probation for reasons that even they couldn't explain when I asked so that I can improve on my limitations but alas, they had no answer. I thought that it's over for me. The company in which I used to work for has claimed the relocation money which they had given me to relocate & created a payment plan for 6 months for me to give it back to them. 

Now after 20 days or so, two senior recruiters of the same company who have been there for 8-10 years from the same location where I was terminated from added me on LinkedIn for some reason. I don't know them but why would they add me knowing I am longer in the company itself? What can be the reason/motive behind this? Is it to keep a tab on me or what? Any ideas?"
Recruiter contacted me to gauge my interest for a marketing position. How should I respond?,"Hello fellow redditors, 

I was contacted by a recruiter for to gauge my interest in a marketing position and would like me to schedule time to speak.

I was recently hired as a Marketing Specialist at my current company and have been there for about a year. 

I am not really looking but I am interested in what this position is and the compensation. How should I respond?"
Looking for thoughts on a position posted by different recruitment agencies.,"Hi everyone,

Firstly, I would like to apologies if my question is a little vague because of all my previous positions I had were a direct hire and never had to deal with recruitment agencies.

I applied for Full-Time position in company X but I didn't get it and received a generic rejection email about no longer recruiting for that position. 

A recruitment company  approached me for a a Short-Term position in the same company X for amount $/hour (Different title than the full-time one) which I agreed on. A week passed and I saw another recruitment company posting the same position but with higher hourly rates ($5-$10/hour more).

I did contact the 1st recruitment company regarding this and they informed me that there were no news yet. 

So, any thoughts about this? About the 1st recruitment company and the low hourly rates in-compare to the 2nd recruitment company? Is there any meaning behind another recruiting company posting the same position?

Many thanks,

Wari"
Can I talk to another hiring manager at the same company?,"So I applied for a job and got a call from a hiring manager a month ago. I felt like the interview went well. However, I didn’t hear back from the hiring manager even tho I sent her 2 follow up emails (1 week apart). 

I really believe that i’m a great fit for the position and want to make sure I take my chance to at least get to a second interview.

My question is, can I contact a different hiring manager at the same company that I found on linkedin? Would that be considered rude? Or be looked at as a negative thing? 

Thanks in advance!"
"Three recruiters emailed me today about the same position, should I just stick with the first one?","Sorry for the humble brag. Position is an urgent higher two month contract with possibility to extend. I’ve never dealt with this kind of thing before, what do?"
Is it worthwhile to question job recruiters about potential wage increases?,"A few months ago I got my first job in the networking field (computer sciences).  I went to school for this, and a week after my final day of class, I started this job, I was hired before I even graduated.  It seemed too good to be true.  A lot of people graduate and are stuck looking for work in their field, I suppose I got lucky enough to have found that quite quickly.  I am thankful for this, and it is experience in the IT field at the very least.

The job I am working only hires people through job recruiters, you can't be directly hired into these positions.  There are multiple recruiting agencies that look for candidates for these jobs, and the one I use is rumored to be one of the better ones (according to coworkers).  Until today, I had never spoken to anyone about their wages, but I have heard multiple other coworkers complain about how low the wages are for this field in comparison to other companies.  I admittedly thought it was low before I was hired, but for entry level, I wasn't going to complain.

Well two of my former classmates were hired to this company, both obtaining the same degree as myself.  However, neither of these two people have any certifications in the IT world, whereas I obtained my CCENT and my CCNA (Cisco certifications.  This is important as we are contractual workers for Cisco), neither of them have experience in the field either.  It comes to find out, they both get paid more than me.  One by a rather insignificant amount, the other by +$4 per hour.  This seems off to me, I studied and paid to obtain certifications whereas the other two have either failed their cert exams, or have yet to attempt them.

When I first applied to this job, all I had was my CCENT.  I was told what my wage would be, and I agreed to it.  Right before being officially hired, I took my ICND2 exam and passed earning me my CCNA.  I figured this might raise my salary slightly, but it didn't.  I was also told that this job only hired those with their CCENT or CCNA certs, but preferred CCNA.  Now I am realizing that that isn't true at all, considering the two people I mentioned obtaining the same position. 

My question is, are job recruiters generally open to the idea of potential wage increases or am I just SOL?  I agreed to the wage offered, and I can't be mad if I am stuck with it.  From what I have gathered from other coworkers (many of which go through the same recruiter as myself), you are kind of stuck with what you get with zero room for advancement.  But what strikes me as interesting is my pay being less, even though, ""technically"", I should be more qualified."
"Offered an in person interview, but haven’t applied yet? Need help","Junior in college. Career fair today.

I was offered an interview tomorrow with a representative from a company I potentially want to work with. 

The representative texted me, confirming our interview and sent me a link to their careers page. Their careers page offers a place to apply online for the position. Should I do this now or after the interview tomorrow?"
LinkedIn recruiter wants to chat by phone about opportunity,"I was wondering what may I expect for this phone call? I have some LinkedIn messages from recruiters from legit companies that message me about an opportunity and to talk over the phone. I’ve never had this happen yet because I didn’t realize that LinkedIn recruiters were real and they weren’t all pyramid schemes. 

What are some things I can expect them to ask me? Will it be like a mini interview? What are some things I should ask?"
How to approach a recruiter with a proposal for a role I could fill?,"Hello all - I'm considering a job change. I know of a company where I could bring my skills to do something new for them that they aren't currently doing. I'm not applying for an existing job posting or anything, I'm bringing a proposal for a way I could help them expand their business.

Would it be appropriate to reach out to their recruiter for something like this?"
Is anyone a recruiter here? Wondering how much I’ll get directly after my temp-to-hire stage through a third-party recruiter.,"Exactly like the title says. I’m currently a temp (through a third-party recruiter) and I’m getting paid XX.XX amount/ hour. I was wondering how much I would be getting when I get hired directly. My coworker told me when he was a temp he got paid less than what he received with his FTE offer (per hour).

Are there any recruiters here that can possibly go in their systems or something and check how much the full amount is and what commission recruiters get? Or how does it work? I can PM what company it is.  

I know this opportunity wasn’t JUST through specific recruiters as I’ve met many interviewees from various recruiting companies."
Should I leave a voicemail to an employer who reached out to me or just wait until the next day to call when they are open?,"I missed a call from an employer who reached out to me on Friday. I was away from home for a few days since I visited my relatives for the holidays. They left a voicemail on Friday and I am just seeing it now on Monday. It's 6:30pm as of late, and they are closed. Should I leave a voicemail that I have heard their voicemail and want to get back in touch with them and to give me a call back. Or should I just wait until tomorrow morning to call?

I am afraid it will look bad that I didn't pick up right away or call back on the same day and just want to notify them as fast as possible that I have received their message and interested in working for their company. 

I also am thinking of what to say to them. I have bad anxiety in general and always blank out.  So far this is what I have wrote down in what to say :

Hello, this is lillypad90 (just using this name for this subreddit). I  am so sorry that I have missed your call on Friday morning, I  am calling in regards to your voicemail about the status of my application for the position as an assistant at your company. I would like to get back in touch and would be more than happy to answer any questions or concerns that you may have. Thank you.""

is this ok to say?  Or should I re-word anything or wait until tomorrow morning when they are in office to contact them? 


Thanks"
How to Thank A Recruiter,"Hello! I recently obtained a new job through a recruiter. He reached out to me with a potential job that I actually ended up getting. I don’t want him to get in trouble but I was desperate to get out of the situation I was in before. I’ve thanked him quite a few times. I want to buy him a gift card to a place he goes to often, as we did chat about our personal-ish lives. Is this acceptable? Or should I just leave it as thanking him?"
What to ask recruiters? (LinkedIn),So I've been sending connection requests to many recruiters in the cyber security industry on linkedin. How do I go about asking to help get a position in their company without coming off as needy or desperate?
Is getting texted by recruiters a thing now?,"I have been actively job searching for 3 years now. Plenty of resume (and updates), few interviews, a metric ton of rejections, my share of ghosting/ no call back.  

My question is that I have been getting a lot of recruiters that text me. I don't think that this is very professional because I reserve texting to people that I have met or know in some way. I would love input from everyone else.  What do you think of staffing companies that have people text you for jobs or opportunities ?"
Unethical Recruiting Practices?,"Just talked to an IT recruiter about two contract jobs in my area that line up really well with my experience. One, essentially an IAM administrator for the state government paying $29/ hr on an 18-month contract period. The other was listed as a sys admin job but is more like higher-level helpdesk (level 2-3 with some sys admin-like responsibilities) paying $30/ hr also on an 18-month contract.

When I received the confirmation email, though, I see the following: 

>Identity and Access Management
>
>    Salary: $45k/year with benefits including:
>        100% insurance coverage – [Recruiter] pays for $571.84/month for your insurance.  This includes health + vision + dental (PPO)
>        15 days Paid Time Off
>        Paid Client Holidays
>        401k Enrollment

>Department of Transportation Systems Admin
>
>    Salary: $47k/year with benefits including:
        100% insurance coverage – Data Concepts pays for $571.84/month for your insurance.  This includes health + vision + dental (PPO)
        15 days Paid Time Off
        Paid Client Holidays
        401k Enrollment

I already know intuitively that the math doesn't add up here and I've let the recruiter know that I don't wish to pursue either job, but I'd like some help with what specifically is wrong with presenting the compensation info like this. It's essentially inflating the hourly rate to attract and sucker people into taking the job, but I feel like there's a better way to put it."
Post-Job application etiquette,"I’m currently searching for a job out of state and found one that is my dream job. It puts my two passions together so perfectly. I’ve applied and sent everything in but now it’s waiting time. (I’m in my career job stage of my life but only a couple of years in) 

What is the post job app etiquette when it comes to calling them back or asking about opportunities later on if I hear I didn’t get it?"
Grunenthal - scam?,"Hello.

I got a text that a company that said they'd viewed my resume on ZipRecruiter.

We did a text-only interview via Google Hangouts and I got the job.

But it seems fishy. They told me of about 20 different positions, all seemed to offer the same pay.

The interview was minimal, they seemed very excited to hire me (based on pretty much nothing) and are going to send me a cheque with which I can buy equipment to start working from home.

They're located in Germany but are building a location near me (Canada) but I had to remind her what country I was in.

Thoughts?"
Information needed on recruiting services and how they can help a recent graduate land a job!,"I just graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Finance in December and I have been applying to Financial Analyst positions posted on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, etc. I have no experience in Finance other than my academic projects. I responded to a post on LinkedIn last night for a Financial Analyst position and the man that I emailed my resume and cover letter to called me today. He works for Parker and Lynch which is a recruitment service. He made it sound like the position I applied for was not for me (a person fresh out of college with no related work experience) but we did set up an interview anyway so that he could potentially find me a position.

Is a recruiting service the way to go for someone in my position? I'm concerned that it'll basically be a temp agency where they'll match me with clerical work that pays hourly when what I'm after is a career with growth potential. I am also concerned that this service will cost money and, as someone fresh out of college, money is in short supply but I have no problem investing in my future if the opportunities they can offer me are worth it.

I'm unsure about how recruiting services work for the job seeker so any information is helpful. Thank you."
General Degree Vs Honours Degree," Hello, I am currently a second year student, studying a Bachelor of Commerce Degree at York University (Toronto, Canada). My program is a 3 year program. I was previously in a 4 year Honours Bachelor of Commerce Program, with a Major in Information Technology. However, I did not like the specific program, and any other Honours program in the Commerce Program, so I recently opted to switch to the General, 3 Year Bachelor of Commerce Degree. After I graduate with the degree, I plan on going to college for one year to pursue a graduate certificate in Information Systems Business Analysis, where there are 3 semesters, the first two being in school, and the third being a co-op placement. My cousin also did a 3 year Bachelor of Commerce Degree, and the same college graduate certificate, and has a nice paying job working for a Fortune Five Hundred Company. So at the end, my degree will say ""Bachelor of Commerce"", and not ""Honours Bachelor of Commerce"" My question to you guys is, in terms of getting hired for a job, am I still good with doing a 3 year degree + College with co-op, rather than doing a 4 year honours degree with no co-op? In other words, do employers care about if the degree is a 3 year or a 4 year one/honours one? Have I made the right decision opting for a 3 year degree + College? Thank you."
LinkedIn recruiter etiquette and insight,"I've done a bit of searching through past threads, but I am looking to get some more perspective on linkedin recruiters. It seems as though in the past couple weeks I have been hit up more than before through linkedin about potential opportunities from recruiters. I work in RE development/construction/design in a medium west coast city. I typically haven't responded to these requests. Is that rude? Since they aren't solicited I don't know whether it's worth responding (read: networking), and the recruiters don't say outright who they are representing. There are companies I would not consider at all and wouldn't want to waste anyone's time. Is there some standard of confidentiality here where I wouldn't find out without directly asking right off the bat?

How do these recruiters go about finding people they message? These messages as of late have been more specific and tailored to specific positions I’ve held or skills I list. 

I am generally happy in my position due to flexibility, work/life balance, co workers and project types, but am also curious about other opportunities and taking on more since I am <4 yrs in the industry. I am particularly curious what others would offer compensation-wise, but it would take quite a bit to consider other opportunities."
"Had a strange email from a startup recruiter, is this legit?","Background - somewhat new software engineer/programmer, been actively looking for work, no industry experience.

A few days ago I got a LinkedIn message from someone looking for a software engineer. I asked him more about what his company did, and he gave this rambly, weirdly written messages with a lot of misspellings. The focus of the company was around two apps, built for a firm and it's client - and he told me two of the startup's potential clients are asking for the technology before January 8th. The recruiter also told me he had personally been trying to make part of the applications but this was too great a challenge for his experience, and that after those first two clients they would be searching for Series A funding. 

Something about this feels really off - like it's some sort of strange scam, or teetering on the edge of falling apart. Is this legit?"
Agency just reposted the job I applied to weeks ago and had an interview with yesterday...should I be worried I’m not getting it?,"I applied for this job back at the end of December through a staffing agency. Meet with the recruiter and signed all the forms. She said she’d forward my resume and the company should get back to her after the holidays. I checked back on Indeed and the job posting I applied to had been removed/expired so I took that as a good sign.

Sure enough after New Years the recruiter called me saying the company wanted to interview me. Yesterday I went to the workplace met the manager, he showed me the workspace and had an interview. I thought it went pretty well. Recruiter even called me after and asked how I thought it went. I asked when she thought they’d make a decision she said a few days. 

I was really feeling good about this job but the agency just posted the same exact position on Indeed literally a day after my interview. Now I’m worried this is a sign I’m not going to get the job and they’re already started looking for someone else 😰. 

What do you think?"
Question,"I had a in person interview last week and got an email/call today from my recruiter that I had a positive review and will be moving forward in the hiring process. I was told I would have to wait another 2 weeks for management approval if I am proper candidate. Should I assume I got the job or still go out and job hunt? My recruiter also told me if I have any questions to feel free and ask, is there anything I should say?

11 months since graduating and still unemployed....depressed after realising that I graduated with the wrong degree.,"I want to apologise for my grammar english is not my first language and it's also a long description, thank you for taking the time to read.

I'm 28 years old I have 8 years of work experience the jobs I had in the past were dead end. During my last job as a store assistant I really enjoyed helping customers and doing in-store visual merchandising and promotions coming up with creative ways to attract people to the store. 

At the time I finally had enough savings to go back to school so I figured marketing is something I should persue. I graduated in May of last year in marketing management with a distinction, however during my time in college as I progressed studying it more I realised that marketing is not something I can see myself doing, but I kept denying this feeling thinking it will get better until my final year I was literally just forcing myself to get this degree done with no passion.  

I love doing visual art and creating things that people find appealing to look at. Art has always been a passion of mine, but you know when you listen to your parents or other people they say there's no money in it and you have to do something that's going to financially secure you. I should have not listen to them. 

Ever since graduating I applied everywhere even while I was still studying got a couple of interviews, but still no luck. I figured maybe I suck at interviewing so I took the initiative to work on my interviewing skills.

Went on more interviews which I thought went well, but still receiving the ""Unfortunately"" or ""We regret to inform you"" e-mails. This morning I just received another rejection e-mail. I think they are sensing the lack of passion and disinterest I have for marketing. 

I am in desperate need of a job and family members are pressuring and judging me which does not help. I'm so burned out and depressed from this literally putting my time and energy into trying to find a job I have no interest in anymore...

I even applied for retail and fast food restaurant jobs just to get my family off my back, but i'm still waiting on a response. 

My plan now is to figure out a way to get into graphic designing I know that is something that would be more suitable for me, but I have no qualification or portfolio and have no money to study it... I am in need of advice on what to do.

Would it be appropriate to contact the recruiter?,"I was contacted by a recruiter from a major aeronautics company in mid-November about a position that both she and the hiring manager thought I would be a good match for. 

 Because it was right before the holidays I wasn't expecting to hear for a while, however, now that it's the New Year I want to email the recruiter to see where they are in the hiring process, would this be unprofessional? Did I wait too long?

Thanks in advance!"
I've never worked with recruiters or staffing agencies before. What are the gotchas I should watch out for?,"I heard recruiters get a portion of your salary, but that might be confused with their commission which is separate from your salary? I guess that's question #1: how does that actually work?

I also heard there are cases where you are technically working for the recruiter/staffing company and they take a cut of your salary. Is that a thing or more misinformation?

Is there any reason not to work with recruiters/staffers? What's the difference between them anyway?

I'm mostly asking because I saw what looks to be the exact same job posted by 5 companies on LinkedIn and it seems they're all recruiters/staffing firms trying to fill one position. If I could figure out who was actually hiring, would it be better to go through them or is there an advantage to going recruiter/staffing instead?"
(Update) My employer has a non-solicitation clause with a client. This client tried to recruit me for a higher paying position.,"This is an update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b7453z/my_employer_has_a_contract_including_a/

After consulting reddit and a family member, I learned that some companies ignore the non-solicitation clause in their mutual service agreement, and ""buy out"" an employee working for the other party when they think it's worth it.

I thought that maybe the company wanted to go that road, but I was prudent. I updated my resume and sent it to the recruiter, asking him to make sure to review their service agreement with my employer -- without telling too much.

2 days later: they want to schedule an interview. All right, got it, they want to go down that road. I chose one of the time slot they proposed.

1 day later: the recruiter sent me a short email apologizing. They won't continue the process with me as I was right, they couldn't solicit me. So yeah, he never checked first.

I felt strangely relieved, as I do love my job
despite not being paid to the level of my expertise. I decided to turn this situation to my advantage. I talked to my boss.

I explained what happened without hiding anything. I even told that I was tempted due to the salary. 

She then told me that higher management was already talking about my position, and how I progressed so much since I started 2 years ago to the point where my title and salary don't match what I do. She asked how much they were offering and took note of it. She was surprised they decided to stop the process and even felt sorry for me, but she thanked me for being transparent.

Long story short: i got a promotion last week, a more relevant title, and 30% bump in salary (higher than what was offered by the other company). 

I'm a person who hates asking for anything,  so this is quite an accomplishment for me! I hope this story can be useful for some of you!"
How do you find a recruiter's contact info to follow up on a job application?,"I've always heard that following up on job applications is a great way to be noticed. However, most of the companies I apply to don't list recruiter contact information. How do I find their contact information so I can follow up?"
I hate writing cover letters!!!,"Ugh. I know this post will sound defeatist but.. I hate writing cover letters. Who doesn't? I imagine more interesting and accomplished people than me probably won't bat an eye when asked to submit a cover letter.

I'm an engineer with \~2 measly years of experience, wanting to get into more project managerial/consulting roles, and when I'm writing these cover letters I sound so generic and DRY.

Like, yep, I see your company does XYZ things. I wouldn't say I'm passionate about what your company does, but I know I could do a good job in the said role. But I'm supposed to ""sound"" passionate about this industry. And I just can't artificially create that passion, so I'm gonna write a basic line indicating that I care. Oh, and this is what I've done in my current role. You know, so you can see that I'm at least, somewhat competent.

Honestly, I wish I was in the creative sector so I could write more ornate letters. I feel like when I'm writing CLs for more analyst positions, I struggle with choosing a dry vs. not dry tone. So I choose dry. I could spend 2-3 more hours researching issues in this industry and writing a college-like essay of how I find this specific issue in this industry interesting. But I don't have the time. Job searching is a numbers game, remember?

Maybe this is a unique problem. All I know is that I just want a job in this specific role because it seems cool and I like having varied work. That's it."
How to go about cold calling/emailing for a job or internship,So I work at Starbucks and noticed a customer had a delta airlines pin on and we started talking about aviation and she told me that she is a 35 year employee at delta airlines and how she loves the company and then she asked me about my career goals and i told her i finish up my degree this fall and passed my written FAA exam and take my practical in 3 months. Then i started talking to her husband who recently retired from Delta but now works at the local airport in operations. He told me i should reach out to xxx about internships or job opportunities at the airport and say that xxx talked to me and gave me his contact info. How do i go about emailing him?
I got an ”we let you know if there is some opening”,"I applied for a part time staffing job. Its a staffing company where they send you out to food shops in need of staffing, in short.

I got an email yesterday from the recruiter, he told me that I definitely have a good and relevant resume but they are full now but they will keep me in their bank.

Later today I’m at the job databank site and I find this company has put out a “new” add searching for applicants. 

How do one interpret this?🤔 Is this normal? Can the reason be they are trying to “widen” their applicants data bank?"
Hiring manager said she would call then didn't. Should I have called her?,"I applied for a position on the company website. I received an email  from the hiring manager a few days later asking when I would be available for a phone interview. After giving her my availability, she responded with a date and time and said she would call me then. Well the time has now passed, after I waited for an over an hour at this point. My SO thinks I should have called the number in her email signature. I am not sure what the etiquette here is though. What do you think? Their hours state that they are now closed anyway."
Headhunter Etiquette,"I was contacted by a headhunter on LinkedIn. We've been working together for a week and it's going well - one interview and one phone screen so far, both with companies where the work is right up my alley.

Meanwhile, my former boss emails me today and says he's been singing my praises to the headhunter that helped him with his search for an executive role. Apparently that headhunter really wants to talk to me.

Is there etiquette on this? If you work with one headhunter while talking to another is it like cheating on your spouse? Or is it more like I can do what I want since it's my job search?

TL;DR Is it wrong to work with two headhunters at the same time?"
Help! I was referred to a company and built a relationship with a recruiter but I recently found out the recruiter was let go?,"Hi I just wanted to get some advice on if theres anything I can possibly do to salvage the previous opportunity with this company? 

Background: 

I was referred to this company (my dream company) by a previous employee in which a recruiter reached out to me to set up a phone call. As I am still in college, a senior soon to be graduated, the recruiter wanted to keep in touch until January when positions for new grads would open up. However, a month after last talking to the recruiter, I checked her LinkedIn and it seems that she is no longer with the company. I'm not too sure what to do now as the recruiter really was my insurance that I would be given at least an interview for the position. Any advice? Thank you!"
Aerotek Recuitment?,"Got a call from them. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work. Sounds like a decent position but after Googling them I've seen a lot of complaints about them.

I haven't yet sent them my resume - the lady who called me mentioned she ""happened upon"" mine but asked me to update it so she could send it to the company looking to hire me. 

After the call she sent me the details of the position. Should I just apply to the position directly and skip this recruitment stuff? I tried googling it but the only result I could find (using the copy from the details she gave me) was through Aerotek's website.

 Of particular interest from the complaints is that they take part of your salary - no thanks. I also saw that they often enter your name into a ""barred pool"" where the employer can't hire you unless through them. If I haven't sent through my Resume yet will I be in this pool?"

Did a burn a bridge with a recruiter?,"A few days ago I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn. Since then I had two phone interviews, one with her an one with her agency's rep for the client. Both went really well. During the initial interview, I asked about pay range, and I was basically currently at the top of what they were offering and I let her know this. She said she will submit people expecting our of range as long as it is within reason.

Yesterday afternoon, she sent me a text that after the second interview, they passed my resume on to the client, who was interested in bringing me in for a face to face interview.

The problem is the job was a much longer commute time for me. While the commute wasn't an issue and I told them that, gas and tolls were, and the difference would have effectively wiped out any raise I would have gotten, basically netting me the same amount for an additional hour and a half of commute every day.

I laid out the math to her in an e-mail, and said that I did not want to waste anyone's time if her client was unwilling to go as high as I would need to leave my current position (basically 15% over the top of range she gave me).

I have not gotten any response back since then. Just wondering if I burned a bridge there, or if this is normal. Should I have handled it a different way? I suppose ideally I would have factored this in earlier, but they kind of moved quickly on scheduling the two phone interviews"
How to end a relationship with a staffing agency?,Seems odd but I don’t wish to move forward with my current recruiter. Things have changed at the office I work at now and I don’t want to waste the recruiters time. Is there an easy way to end it without burning any bridges? I feel awkward and bad for wasting their time as I know it’s their full time job and have been working with them for over a month.
Why recruiters role move so quickly?,"It happened to me two times already, recruiter described this perfect role and told me wait for the interview, then next day this position has been filled. Is this a common thing?"
Asking the recruiter about the second job?,"So I'm working with a recruiter right now and he submitted me for two jobs.  I already had a phone interview for the first one and was supposed to have an onsite this week, but they have not gotten back to him to set up a time (the team is just being set up, so they're very busy).  Is it rude if I ask about the second job?  Or do recruiters prefer to focus on one job at a time for people?"
Should I apply using a recruiter or directly (already have reached out to head of department myself),"Hi all,

I'm in a bit of a tricky situation. I am deciding whether to use a recruiter (that I have been working fairly closely with and I know does a good job) for a job posting or whether to wait and apply directly.

This is a company that I have been referred to by someone who used to work there and I was able to get in contact with the head of the department through LinkedIn and then email. The head was very responsive and mentioned that they would have some roles opening up soon. This makes me think that I have at least a bit of a good shot of getting an interview myself soon.

Today, my recruiter emails me letting me know that this company is about to open up some roles and is asking whether she can submit me. These roles are about to be posted so there's no way I can say I've already applied to them.

Should I use the recruiter or just wait it out and try to do it directly. If I get hired directly, the company would not have to pay a recruiting fee which makes me think I could negotiate a higher salary. I don't want to piss of this recruiter though as she has been doing a good job and has gotten me some phone interviews so far.

What would you all do?"
Any HR people out there that can shed some light on why you may contact a candidate asking for an interview and then completely not respond?,"I received an email message from an HR talent acquisition manager yesterday morning saying they know I have applied for this position in the past and it was on hold, but now active again. She attached job description and said she would love to speak to me tomorrow (meaning today) or Monday 4/22.

Excited, because this would be a dream job for me, I responded within the hour about times for Friday. No response was received.

I normally would give it a few days, but because she offered up the next day or Monday, I know I needed to get this scheduled before the weekend. So I followed up with an email this morning just to “check in” to see if today would work and offered alternate times Monday.

The weirdest thing is, I received an automated out of office reply. It said she was away on business travel today and returning Monday with intermittent access to email/phone.

Did she make a mistake and realize she contacted the wrong person?! How did she not know she was traveling the next day?

This is the third time this has happened to me over the course of my career. Not a lot. This one I really care about, because as I said. I want this job!

So, what can i do if she never gets back to me??"
Question for recruiters/HR - Do you ever challenge the low pay offered for some roles?,"I say this because I have worked research analysis, insight, management intelligence, business intelligence, etc. 

I have worked in that arena for over 10 years and I am still staggered by the low pay offered for some very highly technical roles. 

I just saw a job that needed:

* Advanced SQL

* R / Python

* Extensive experience of PowerBI / Tableau

* Advanced Microsoft Dynamics 365 skills

Amongst other extensive and highly technical demands, I think including 5+ years in analysis. 

All for a piffling £20-25k

Bearing in mind there are still plenty jobs out there are £35k+ that just need advanced Excel skills or jobs with similar (but not as much) skills for £55k± (sometimes as high as £80k).

Do you ever challenge the employer? Lower their expectations? What do they say?"
Appropriate etiquette when contacting recruiters on LinkedIn/other platforms?,"Hey folks. I just relocated to a new city and am trying to use all the professional tools I can to build a new professional network here (Alumni Associations ect.). When it comes to online platforms however, I realize that I'm not really sure when it is acceptable to reach out to a recruiter directly, particularly on LinkedIn. To give a specific example, there is one semi-private organization I really, *really*, want to work for. I would describe them as a think tank/nonprofit that is a consultancy for private businesses. This particular organization does their recruiting in house. I activated the free month of LinkedIn premium, so I am able to see the recruiter who posted the job I'm considering applying for. I am tempted to use my new LinkedIn features to contact her and ask a few questions (am I qualified, are there other positions I'm better qualified for) and express how much I want to work for them in any capacity. I am of course worried about to things: 1, will this come off as desperate rather than proactive? 2, will this be seen as bad etiquette on the platform and potentially shut me out of future opportunities with them because I look like a rude jerk abusing my ""premium"" powers? I know that these are the kind of connections the platform is designed to provide to people, but I can easily see how reaching out to someone in the wrong way could make you look like an idiot who feels entitled to their time for no reason. Am I overthinking these online interactions, or are my concerns legitimate?  Any recruiters here who have felt pestered by someone trying to become a prospect? Thanks in advance for the advice!"
Why do these recruiters from LinkedIn instantly want to jump onto a phone call with little to no information beforehand?,"I get messages almost daily by recruiters that are like:

""Wow, your resume is so cool, let's set up a call to discuss [Generic Title 3]""

My resume is usually only tangentially related to the position they are contacting me about, but I would totally be open to seeing if it's a good fit. The thing is they would rather ghost me than give me information through LinkedIn or email. I just don't want to waste my time or theirs. Based on the list of duties I could probably tell instantly if it's something I would want to do. Are they scared that I will find the position myself and bypass them?

I'm just kind of ranting, but it's annoying that they are losing a candidate that would be interested otherwise."
Should I follow up with a temp job recruiter after he submitted me for four different positions?,"This past week I was accepted as an applicant for the temp department that fills vacancies at a local college. The recruiter there had four different openings he submitted me for. I only heard back from one of them (and got an interview). 

I'm not sure if I haven't heard back from the others because they weren't interested or because they were already out for the holidays since the semester had ended. 

I don't want to appear desperate or become a nuisance, but I'm curious about where I might stand with those other three positions. I also wonder if I won't be able to get in touch until the beginning of January."
Recruiter wants last 4 of social?,"I was contacted by a recruiter from ICONMA about a contract position with Google. They seem to have good glassdoor reviews (at least no one is claiming to have been scammed). Is it odd that I was asked for the last 4 digits of my social? I was also asked to provide birthday day and month but without the year. Lastly, they need my full legal name as it appears on SS; this part seems normal although there was a heavy emphasis on cannot deviate from SS card at all, including omitting or abbreviating your middle name."
How have many of you gone about getting a recruiter to help you?,"I have been job searching for 3 months now, and I have not received a single legitimate interview offer.  In the past week I submitted my resume on a local recruiting agency site, and another more geared toward my background.  There isn’t a phone number listed for candidates to call.  Everyone else I know has had their recruiter find them."
LinkedIn - do you reply to unsolicited interview offers?,"I could not find a way to ""hide"" myself from LinkedIn - I do not want to delete my profile, as I have valuable connections there.

&#x200B;

I have unchecked ""Looking for a job""; my profile also starts with disclaimer that I am satisfied in my current posting.

&#x200B;

Yet I keep getting spammed with ""please add me"" and messages with offers for an interview or at least a conversation... it is really annoying.

&#x200B;

I know that with the current economy, employers are begging for someone, anyone, to hire and work for them. And that companies have to refuse customers because they do not have enogh workers to fill the order.

&#x200B;

But we are people as well, and deserve some respect too... yes, it is a sign of frespect to reply to messages sent to me, but there are so many...

&#x200B;

I am half-tempted to just write there ""You do not have a chance to match and exceed what I have now, even if you paid me double"", but then I would probably still get messages asking ""Are you sure? Can we talk about it?""...

&#x200B;

(PS: and that actually is true, I like my company's culture, and I love having a workplace within walking distance)"
Reminder to check if the recruiter is legit,"I recently got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn and we set up time to chat.

The she emails and asks to push the time back by 30 min “because she got a client call”.  (Hmmmm... usually recruiters aren’t this obvious that job hunters aren’t clients.)

Anyway, before the call I realize I had never heard of her company before and I look up the website.

It’s a super basic, Squarespace website. Essentially, it doesn’t look legit. 

I decided before the call I would not work with her to get me a job. The conversation we have on the phone further confirms this. I’m actually mad at myself for telling her a bit too much about my income expectations. Plus it turns out she tried to get me on a job I’d already applied to.

I’m glad I checked the website though. A recruiter is presenting you to a company and if this person doesn’t know what they’re doing, what happens to you?

Anyway, just some advice!"
Got contacted by a possible scamming staffing agency,"Hey guys 
I got a call from a guy from Coders Data saying he's interested in finding me a suitable job. They will provide me infinite interviews until I secure a Job as well as pay for travel costs for interviews.
 Catch is I have to pay $500 upfront to ensure their services. This money is a security deposit to ensure I don't leave during the hiring process . I was reluctant and they kept on pressing me to take their services. The guy calls me everyday for it. When I wasn't convinced, he transferred me to his manager who kept insisting to take his company's services. 
I looked up the company and it looks legit but IDK if I should take it or not. 
Thoughts ?"
Being absolutely spammed by recruiters when a new job req drops - what's going on?,"This is now the third time this has happened. A job req goes live (I'm in web development). It is usually for something for the website of a state or city, and for the next 2-4 days, my phone is ringing off the hook. I'm talking sometimes the same number will call me 4-5 times in a row. Typically, these recruiters are foreign, and sometimes I'll get multiple recruiters from the same company contacting me! What is going on? It feels massively unprofessional and is super annoying to boot."
I emailed a recruiter to negotiate salary and they never replied to my email. What should I do next?,"I received a full time offer from a company I interned with. I was thrilled to receive an offer from them but found the offered salary was a little underwhelming. With this, I emailed them asking for an increase after I explained my rational as to why I was worth the extra money. I was expecting an email back saying yes or no, or even an email with a counter offer. It has, however, been a little over a week since I sent my email and I've heard nothing back. The deadline to accept my offer is slowly approaching. How do I handle this situation? 

For context, I know this recruiter fairly well as I spent a lot of time with them during my internship and they have always emailed me back within a few days during previous communications. Is there anything I should do as my deadline approaches?"
missed called from potential employer,"I had a missed call from a retailer that i applied for a few weeks ago. I was still in class when that call was made and I didn’t know who phone number was it, until I google it. They didn’t leave a voicemail, so I dont know if I should call back or just wait if they’ll call me again. Have anyone ever had this happened before, what did you guys do in this kind of situation?"
"Interviewed for Financial Analyst position, Feel like I was bait and switched.","So I applied for a temp to hire financial analyst role in a smaller town through Accounttemps (Robert Half) one evening last week. I got a callback the next morning and scheduled an interview for today. When I did the interview the recruiter basically talked about how they would be looking for roles which are a good fit for me and we would be in touch about them. When I asked about the specific job I had applied for, he said that role is through another office in another city and he would check with that office. The other thing was salary. I have admittedly limited experience in finance, but I have enough other experience and degrees where all the research I have done suggests that I should be able to make anywhere between 48k - 56k starting depending on where in the country I am. The specific role I applied to was entry level and well within that range. They talked about how people starting out in this area typically start at 30 - 35. I find that difficult to believe as this is a larger metro with high costs of living. 

To recap:

First, when I set up the interview it was clearly for the specific role I applied for and when I got there it was just ""we'll find you a job!"". Second, if the role I applied for was through a different Robert Half office, why did I interview with this one? Third, the entry level pay advertised was MUCH higher than what they told me in person to expect. I think they posted a good job to get candidates like me to apply..."
Is the recruiter trying to tell me something? Has the position been filled?,"I couple of weeks ago a recruiter contacted me about a job in another country.  I was told I would be brought in to support the legal team for six months or a year . I was excited because it honestly sounded like exactly what I have been looking for and asked that he put me forward for the role.  He calls me to discuss the salary before putting me forward and says he’d be I touch in about a week. Two weeks pass and I hear Nothing so I reach out to ask for an updated and I’m told that the initial review has been positive but we are just waiting for the hiring manager to return.  

Earlier in the week I call and I’m told there’s still no news but then all of the sudden a day later I’m told they want me for a shorter time to start with but are also evaluating an internal candidate.  The next day I call the recruiter to clarify what they mean and I’m told “ they don’t know what they want” .

Reaching Out to a Recruiter,Am I being too forward or desperate if I message a recruiter on LinkedIn after I see that they viewed my profile? Or would it help my chances of getting the position I applied for?
Unsolicited Job Offer?,I got an email and call today from Barrister Global Services. I don't remember applying. I have gotten a few other offers as well like this one. They look like phishing attacks from what I can gather. I'm wondering what others experiences are with this stuff.
Two recruiters in the same week miss my phone screen interview times? (auto reply stating recruiter on vacation?? 😐0.o),"This has to be the most ridiculous and stressful week. I have had 4 back to back interviews for different companies. Countless studying on tech things and interview prep. I seriously baffled that this has happened twice in one week. I schedule an interview just for it to be delayed and its all on the recruiters end and not mine.

Whats ironic about this whole thing is that if i were to miss my interview they would automatically let me go but they as recruiters can be unprofessional and not state a thing. I was also scheduled with another person and not the recruiter.

Here is the thing from what I gathered from this. The recruiter who contacted me didnt want to do the phone screening so the recruiter assigned someone else to do it which is why the recruiter avoided the day I stated to do it which was yesterday. I wondering if there is a conflict with this recruiter and the other person lol. Who does that?? So i guess the person who was assigned is  like f this im not doing it. I guess they are just losing a great candidate because i recently got an offer that was 10k higher than theirs lmfao

This is weird and really unprofessional. My big question is will they throw my application out because the whole position that i applied for and was selected for starts in a week they told me and the recruiter told me they arent available after thursday :/"
Recruiters: how impressive/doesn't make a difference when a candidate puts together a plan?,"Hi,

I read multiple places online that hiring managers are really impressed when you put together a plan powerpoint or information on what you would do/ideas to improve.  Also read online that they like 30-60-90 day plans.  I started thinking of some but don't want to be too forward showing all the changes that can be made.  

Also, my next interview is a phone interview and so I can't present anything in person.  Can I say something like I would love to meet you in person and show you a plan I put together?  But also I don't want to set up too high expectations for the plan and rather it be something surprising they see at the end.

Would really love to get this job and I passed the phone screen and have a phone interview with the hiring manager so I'm just trying to practice a lot and think of ways to stand out without being in person.

Thanks in advance!"
Is Rocs Grad Staffing Legit?," Hi all, I'm currently in NOVA, I just got a call from Rocs Grad Staffing, saying they help recent grads find jobs, I had a 5-10 min phone call with them, I looked on glassdoor later and found about 1/2 of the reviews call it a scam where they bait and switch the applicant. Any advice?"
How do you react when recruiters offer your a worse job than you applied for or submit you for a job you never signed up for?,I've had this happen more than once. I almost decided to say sure schedule me for an interview and purposely flake and never call them again. These are recruiters for companies and for staffing agencies doing this. They know no one wants these jobs and I don't like them trying to push them on me.
Question about Independent Recruiting,"I'm out of work right now and job hunting for the first time in a really long time.  I get a lot of contact from independent/third-party recruiters, i.e. headhunters.  They contact me with a position they're trying to fill.  In most cases, we have a good, or even great conversation.  Then comes the brick wall, i.e. ""let me talk to my account manager"".  After that, I do not hear back.  I've spoken to upwards of 100 of these headhunters over the last few months.  I'm wondering why the conversation goes so good with the headhunter but the account manager feels so differently?  Or is the recruiter just BS'ing me?  It might be worth mentioning that I have 27 years of experience but I've said I can come down into their salary ranges.  I'd love to know why I never hear back.  Perhaps someone knows how these independent recruiting companies work; I don't.  Thanks!"
"Multiple recruiting firms, same job?","Last week, I got contacted by a recruiter on LinkedIn, for the first time, out of the blue. I wasn't looking for a position, but the job sounds like a great opportunity. It's in the medical technology field, and I'm currently in academia. I'd been planning on going to graduate school (PhD) and likely continuing on the track to become a professor, just because it was a clear path in my field of research. However, with this job I would probably not need to get an advanced degree unless I decided to later. The lower end of the salary range is a 20k pay bump from what I'm making now, too, and there are a lot of opportunities for growth.

I noticed, however, that the same job was posted by another recruiting company... The company that contacted me does not have the job posted, and they're in a different country, but it looks legit from what I can tell. The company the job is for is based in a different country as well, but they have locations in the US. Is it common for a company to use two different recruiters for the same job? 

The recruiter I spoke with said he'd pass along my resume and that I should hear from the hiring manager next week."
"""The Recruiting Professionals"".. anyone heard of them?","Based in Virginia.. address is to an office space building right off a main access road. Domain hosted by GoDaddy and every time you call their main number I get a recording to leave a voicemail... no receptionist.  Email appears to be hosted by Yahoo.

Reason I'm asking? $150k work from home for an IT Generalist with overseas travel.

Sounds too good to be true.

So here I am hoping others here have heard of this place."
Should I ask to be reconsidered for a position I declined a few months ago?,"I am in a troubled situation...... and kinda want to beat myself for it.  I received two job offers in June and long story short, now I want the one I declined.  One job was a contract position with a non-profit and the other was with a large finance company as a full time employee.  I had been in the corporate world for such a long time that I wanted to try working at a non-profit and had been looking for that type of opportunity.  At the same time I started interviewing for that, I was put in contact with a friend of a friend at the finance company and we ended up meeting for lunch and then I was asked to interview in person with multiple people and after a background check I was made an offer.  Within hours I was also offered the nonprofit contract to hire job.

I thought about it over a weekend and felt that I should try the non-profit because I believed in the mission, etc. and at the end of the day I had the flexibility to move on fairly easily if I found I hated it immediately because it was contract to hire.  Fast forward 3 months and I was told they were immediately ending my contract due to finances and I left that morning.  Needless to say, I am now without a job with no warning after I was just getting back on my feet.  When I declined the other job I sent the hiring manager a nice email and explained that I really appreciated her time and I just wanted to try something different and it had absolutely nothing to do with the offer or the company.  Had the timing been different, even by a few days, I would have accepted that position.

I don't know if her specific position is still open but they do have the role open on their website.  I really made a mistake.  I guess if I want to look at the silver lining it would be that I at least tried something and learned it was not for me, but now I have no job.  The contract company will look for something too but they weren't expecting it either so there isn't anything lined up.

I want to reach back out to the finance company and ask to be reconsidered.  I just have no idea how to approach it.  I didn't decline on bad terms and did explain that it was an apples to oranges situation so I do think that is positive.  How do I approach this situation?  Should I reach back out to the recruiter or directly to the hiring manager?  Is it a bad idea in general?  I thought calling would be the most professional thing to do but I feel weird doing that knowing that everyone uses their cell phone and it is a bit of an awkward potential conversation.  I want to be able to explain myself which I know would come through much clearer in writing.  How do you even title an email like that?  What would I put in the subject line?  I am inclined to go back through the recruiter given I would still have to go through official channels regardless.  And I know there are similar roles open even if it isn't hers that maybe I could still be considered for which a recruiter would know more about.  I also know how busy email gets and if I reach directly out to her I feel like there is a chance she would miss it or not have time to respond immediately and I don't want to put her in that position given she is a friend of a friend.  I feel like if she is going to say no or that the position has been filled it would be much easier for her to not have to do it directly to me.  

But I could be overthinking it.  Does anyone have advice?  I am a bit panicked right now which doesn't help with the thinking clearly. 

Thanks in advance!!"
How do you respond when a recruiter asks you how much you make at your current position?,I'm in a situation currently where I am underpaid at my position- I'm paid embarassingly under the average (15-20%) and I know I won't get an appropriate raise from my company (already tried). Had a recruiter ask me my current salary and it made me realize it would probably work against me in trying to get better pay. How do you respond to that question?

Salary said in interview below company range,"Hi,

So I had an interview and when the recruiter asked for salary I said +- 55K, she said that currently the job has set 60K to 70K but that she will put me for 60K.  Is there a way I can increase my salary now that I know the range is higher than what I set?  i feel like I stuck myself in the lower end now, sigh.

Thanks in advance!"
"When getting responses to applications, recruiters are calling and not emailing - how can I get them to email?","Hi all,

This might sound trivial but I guess I am not used to it? So last time I appleid for jobs (August 2018) in my new city on the East Coast, recruiters would email me asking for a time to set up for a phone screening.

For personal reasons, I'll be back in my hometown for 3-4 months and am just looking for filler job until I get back to my new city. I haven't gotten a single email about setting up a time to talk, rather I am just getting calls from recruiters either wanting to set up a different time or wanting to do the screening right then.

I don't like this because I am not always available to answer the phone right away and emailing gives me the time to answer when I am available. I also like to have the record of emails, in case there is any confusion.

Is there anyway for me to basically just let recruiters know/allude to the fact that I would rather an email correspondence than over-the-phone?"
HELP: SmartRecruiter Email not correct? Kind of urgent,Got contacted by someone at a company I applied too and they use smart recruiter. The email address she had sent the email on was not her company one it was smart recruiter. I replied to that one yesterday afternoon and she has not responded yet. I was looking at the email and I noticed the email I sent it to looks like a mess that has a smart recruiter address. I’m suspecting she didn’t get it and I want to resend my reply but there’s also a possibility that she hasn’t checked it yet. Has anyone had experience with smart recruiter? Tried googling it but it wasn’t helpful.
Possible Job recruiter scam?,"Hey, I figured I'd ask for advice here since I'm still trying to figure out if my whole situation is too good to be true. 

Basically about 1-2 days ago I put my resume on a different job board hoping to find different jobs than the ones I was seeing on the one I was using. Then earlier today I got a call from a recruiter asking if I was interested in a job, the first job he offered had too much of a commute so I turned that one down but then the second job was like a great match for me. It's close by, the pay was a bit less than the 1st job but still decent and the work itself didn't seem to demanding. 

The recruiter didn't really ask about my skills or anything and just said he'd get back to me. Shortly after he calls me back saying that the company would want me and that I'd be starting Wednesday (2 days). It just seems so odd that I didn't even get an interview. The recruiter then asked if I could come into his office to fill out paperwork and forms tomorrow. He gave me a bit of info of the job and also asked if I'd want to set up direct deposit. I at first said yes and he said I would need to get a direct deposit form from my bank.

So after the call I calmed down from my excitement of finally get a chance at a job again, and felt like the whole situation felt really off. The recruiter emailed me and mentioned that I was going to need to bring my drivers licence, social security card and a direct deposit form from my bank with all my banking info on it. And ""  It all needs to be printed, it can’t be hand written or our corporate office won’t accept it.  "". I didn't think recruiters were the ones that are suppose to handle the HR related stuff of the company i'm being hired at so why does he need all that info. He later sent me another email asking for my Date of birth, Full name and SSN so he could "" get your background check running"". Again why is the recruiter the one handling that. 

I looked him up and his company (Synerfec \[Didn't get any results here\]) and while that info all seems legit and the business itself seems right, the whole situation feels off. I called the company he said he got me the job for and they confirmed that they got a call for me and wanted to hire me. So I'm going over tomorrow before meeting with the recruiter to just check out the business myself to make sure the job offer itself is real. 

So my main question is, is this how job recruiter handle things now a days? It just feels so off that they would ask for the information and do the stuff a company itself would be doing. Should I just ""blow off"" this recruiter even if he may have gotten me a legitimate job opportunity?  Or just go up and meet him in his office location and let him know I'm not comfortable giving him that sort of sensitive information and would rather the company do it."
Is it Bad Ettiquette to Contact Multiple Recruiters at the Same Recruiting Company?,"I am just trying to increase my chances, but just want to know if I am causing any inconvenience on their side."
Internal recruiter set up last minute phone interviews. Is that normal? Any tips?,"I applied to an internal posting about a month ago, and promptly forgot about it.

Today before the end of work day, I get 3 calendar invites from the internal recruiter titled ""Phone interview"" with the actual hiring manager and 2 others within the team. The calls are 2 days from now. Is that weird or is that how things work now? I haven't had a real interview in a few years so I may be out of touch and I need to prepare myself.

Previously, I've always spoken to the HR recruiter first about the position and times I'm available to speak further. I've never really had an interview just sprung on me like this, so part of me feels like its maybe just a formality before I get rejected. Luckily I'm available and will be able to take all 3 call appointments. 

Are there any tips for internal interviews? I've only done one before as a screening and I wasn't a fit for that role. I feel like I can be good for the new position, but hopefully I'll get more info speaking with the manager."
How to turn down an agent without ghosting and how to explain vacation next March?,"I have an agent who called me on Monday to introduce some positions. One of them requires 2+ years of retail operations experience in a supermarket, which I don't have so I declined it since my only experience is working as a cashier at Target for two years. 

The other position is similar, working as an assistant manager in a bookstore, but also requires 1+ year of similar experience in a bookstore. 

I already responded to an e-mail she sent in which she included the job descriptions for both positions and I turned her down due to lack of experience. However, she insisted that I at least try and submit my resume for both positions. 

In addition, I have already planned a vacation of 2 weeks to a month next March. Do you think that would be detrimental to getting these positions in the first place? The onboarding process should take about 3 months for both positions if that makes a difference. Would it be a good idea to just say I'm not looking for a new job for right now since I am planning on a vacation in the near future? 

The agent has been calling me for the past two days as well, but I haven't had a chance to answer since I've been working pretty long shifts both Monday and Tuesday. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or advice!!"
What to do when the same vacancy is advertised both by the company directly and by external recruiters?,"My initial thought was that the companies will prefer to hire directly, as that will cost them less.

"I think I just annoyed a job recruiter who was recruiting me for my dream position, need some insight if I broke protocol when dealing with the recruiter","Hey Guys, so I'm having a bit of anxiety and I just wanted some insight into how job recruiters think and function to either come to terms I ***forked*** up or to put my mind at ease.

So I got contacted last week by a job recruiter with a position at a MAJOR company with a job that looks like it was written for my skillset and experience. Even the recruiter mentioned this and told me at the time that he has high hopes that I'd get the position and that he'd most likely have an answer by Friday. He even said he loved my personality and thought I'd fit right into the company. 

Friday comes along and I hadn't heard anything from him so I sent an email to follow up. Problem is, I found out on Monday that my website/email hosting site has been having authentication issues where all emails lack a certificate and they get filtered as spam by most email clients, so my email didn't go through. 

So today I called to follow up and got the recruiting agency's front desk and asked to speak to the recruiter. He seemed pretty annoyed that I had called, confirmed that he didn't get my email, said that he had already submitted my resume and application and was still waiting to hear back, but kept acting annoyed as if I had broken some kind of protocol by calling him.

Here's a few questions I had about the process:

* Is this a reason for him to pull my resume and portfolio from this position?
* Is my potential job jeopardized because of this interaction?
* If so, then is there anything I can do to remedy this situation?

Thanks!

"Reaching out to recruiters for coffee on LinkedIn, is this a no-no?","Hey everyone,

  
 What are your thoughts on reaching out to tech recruiters on LinkedIn and asking them out for coffee as a way to learn more about their problems, what they look for in potential hires, and also as a way to network?

  
 My goal is to eventually land a role as an SDR at a tech start-up, but I don't want to come across like I’m begging for a job. I understand that I should provide value first and would do my research before reaching out.

  
 I'm just wondering if this is something you guys would recommend or if it's a big no-no? And of course, I know many will say no since they're undoubtedly busy, but I figured I would still like to try.

  
 Thank you!"
Response to Recruiter Email,"I got an email yesterday from a recruiter at a company I applied to at the end of August; the position is entry level and requires 3 years of experience in addition to a bachelor's degree. What should I say in the reply? I'm assuming that the email was sent in response to my application (albeit a few weeks after the fact) so it's likely they know I don't have the experience, but I'm not sure of what to say."
Can HR see me as being at fault for this?,"Me and this other coworker started out the same time and we were doing fine at first. Then one day when we worked on a project together two things happened.  I wanted the project to be accurate so I discussed that we should research more into it before finalizing it. The other was that I said her word doc file was a spreadsheet and not a formula(in a no ill intend way). The next day I would try to talk to her and she would ignore me. Now she doesnt talk to me unless we are in front of our managers. Today during a meeting with our director, our director wanted everyone to take a employee inclusion workplace training(training to make sure u make other employees feel welcomed). I felt like he said that as a indirect way towards me and the other coworker. But like I feel like I didnt do anything wrong bc i tried talking to her and she would ignore me. She ignored me for 2 weeks now. Do you think HR would see me being at fault for this?"
"Quit without notice yesterday, what do I tell recruiter i'm meeting with tomorrow?","Yesterday I quit my job without notice. It was an extremely nasty work environment that I'd been actively looking to leave for months with middling success (several interviews and even one opportunity that made it to salary negotiations before falling through), and I finally hit my limit. I didn't make a scene or say anything inflammatory, I sent a simple and formal email announcing my immediate resignation on my commute home. I immediately started sending out my resume, and I received a call today from a recruiting agency that works in my field, and we have a meeting tomorrow to discuss possible roles. 

How should I discuss quitting without notice, and the reasons for leaving my job? I know I shouldn't talk ill of my employer in regular interviews, but I have heard that being straightforward with recruiters is better than trying to cover up what could be seen by potential new employers as a red flag."
A Question about LinkedIn,"Hi Reddit,

I apologize for my non descriptive title, but it's a rather silly question, that I don't know how to phrase properly. Basically, I want to use LinkedIn, but I don't like the fact that anyone can look me up (I've had a landlord that I was in the middle of a legal dispute with, along with an individual who I do not want to know my whereabouts). However, not having anyone be able to access my LinkedIn seems to defeat the purpose of having a LinkedIn (making myself available for any job opportunities).

Is there any way around this, or is it basically a ""Choose One"" situation?"
Concerns about a Recruiter,"Yesterday I received a message on LinkedIn saying that I would be an ideal candidate for a position that I was very much interested in. The recruiter asked to set up a time to talk the same day, so I immediately responded and said when I would be available. We spoke for about 10 minutes and everything seemed to go great! Because the position was a contract to hire, he said he would email me the full job description as well as the benefits that his company would offer while I was under the contract period prior to moving to be a full time employee as soon as we hung up. He also explicitly stated to text or call him once I reviewed the information if I wanted to move forward as this was his personal number.

About two and a half hours go by with no email so I decide to text him saying:

""Hello,
This is [me], I am so sorry to bother you, I just haven't received any information via e-mail yet and wanted to check in with you. Thank you!""

About 30 minutes later he says:
""Sorry, I'll send that information over right now. My apologies!""

Another 30 minutes go by and I finally receive a message on LinkedIn with him apologizing for ""forgetting"" and including ONLY the job description and no benefits. Feeling frustrated, but not wanting to blow this opportunity, I respond by saying thank you for sending the information; attached my resume; and said that I am interested in moving forward and would also like to view the benefits if possible as I didn't seem to receive that attachment.

I have yet to hear anything back and I'm just feeling so confused! Did I do something wrong here?"
I passed my phone interview and she wants to interview virtually tomorrow. Isn’t this kind of too soon?,"I told her I’m no longer with my older company. 
I don’t want to start until sept 16.

I feel like I’m gonna get the job. I’m quite nervous. If this is a virtual interview shouldn’t there be a real in person interview atleast a meet and greet? 

So if she asks when I want to start do I say September 16? 
Anyone give me advice for virtual interviews"
How do I thank a recruiter that's been really good to me?,"I signed up with a temp agency a few months ago, and the woman who has worked with me since day one has been amazing. She finds roles that are exactly what I'm looking for, and has been a good advocate on my behalf. She's really stellar at her job, and I'm super impressed. 

I'm taking a full-time job that I found on my own, but I really want to thank her for her good work (and come back to her should I need her again). What's something I can do to show my appreciation?"
Recruiters Ghosting me after first response?,"Recruiters contacting me as a good fit. External and in house human resources. It is to setup a call or answer a few questions through email.

I get completely ghosted after that. Is this normal? They don't respond. It is frustrating because they leading you on and then ghost after first or second email."
"I was laid off two days ago, closure interview?","  My job closed down mid March with plans to reopen after the lockdown was over. I worked here for 5 years and during this time had my son and unfortunately became a single parent. 

 My (then, when my son came) bosses reassured me that they would accommodate my childcare schedule no problem. Year 4, new management came in (young with no children) and basically got fed up with accommodating my schedule restraints (9-5, daycare hours). 

  Lockdown came and I was told I would have a job no problem as soon as the county reopened. Well they called on Friday and told me that they could no longer work with my schedule and decided on separation. When I asked what the official reason for separation was, they replied “my inability to get childcare”. As if I could afford to have an on-call nanny, who is completely available 24/7. (My job has double shifts and puts out the schedule 3 days before the work week).


 Now they want me to come in on Tuesday for  a “closure” interview. I’m terrified they’re going to offer me the option to resign on good terms (no unemployment) or be fired (unemployment but bad on resume).

  I feel betrayed by a workplace who preaches family values and job security. 

What should I do?"
Responding to work emails post-layoff,"I was laid off last week. Today I got an email from an old coworker asking for help with something. She has taken over my project, while I was laid off. She wasn't involved in my project to begin with, so there's a lot of stuff she doesn't know.

Her question is simple enough, but I'm worried it's going to open a door to her constantly asking me questions. Then I'll be doing work for free. Her question also seems like she put no critical thought before coming to me.

I mostly feel like the company laid me off, they can deal with whatever consequences of that without me. If they feel like they need me, they can give me my job back.

Thoughts?

Edit: it was an email from someone at work to my personal email. And this person 100% knows I was laid off. Thanks for all the feedback.

At this point, I'm considering just saying ""I don't remember without looking at the project."" And if they ask me to do that, then I'll ask a consulting fee. The question really is simple, but because it's a question that could have been easily discovered if my coworker spent a minute looking at my work, it just feels like they're testing boundaries. There's literally a note on my project that would answer her question."
"My position was cut $7,000, what should I do?","Last week, my position was eliminated and a new position was created $7,000 lower. The company is not falling on hard times, as they opened a position at a higher pay than mine and even gave a few people raises.

I feel so devalued as someone with a degree in computer science. I knew $47,000 was a low pay, but $40,000 feels unacceptable to me and a slap in the face. I’ll still have to apply and interview for this lower position and I don’t know if I should. If I don’t apply, I’ll be unemployed as of June 1st."
Are my coworkers (and possibly me) about to be laid off?,"UPDATE: Both of the coordinators were fired for poor performance, not laid off/let go. At the 10 o’clock meeting, our supervisor let us know what happened and divvied up our new responsibilities. We were also politely threatened that we would be next if we can’t keep up with the new load of work, and reminded that we are being monitored 100% of the time. This is a state job, so the COVID hiring freeze could continue up to a year. There’s a whole load of toxic patterns in this position, so I plan on doing my best to secure another position and leave since I’m 110% sure I’m next to be fired. Thank you to everyone who responded, having some insight helped me tremendously!

——————-

This is my first job out of college so I’d appreciate some insight on this weird situation. I work on a team of 5 research coordinators as the only research assistant, and yesterday 2 of our team members received emails that they will have individual meetings with our supervisor, boss, and the department’s HR guy on Friday 5/15. 

Their meetings are scheduled at 9:00am and 9:30am. The remaining 3 of us have been sent a meeting for the same day at 10:00am, where all 3 of us will be in the meeting together. We’re apparently expected to give an overview of what we do each day and are responsible for, even though we all check in daily through email (because we’re teleworking).

I’ve already heard that studies have been taken from the 2 research coordinators who received emails and given to the others. Which makes me think they’ll be laid off at their meetings tomorrow. Does anyone know if that’s what this sounds like? And why the 3 of us will have to explain what we do on a regular basis, minutes after the other meetings end?

They can’t let us all go because our multiple studies would completely fall apart, so I imagine they’ll at least keep 2 coordinators. I’m only the assistant so I’m genuinely shocked I’m not currently set to have a mandatory individual meeting with the HR guy...

It’s felt like we’ve had to “sell” ourselves multiple times over the past few weeks and basically provide an argument on why we’re a necessary part of the team. I’m wondering when this will end and if I’ll always have to fight periodically just to keep this job. Any insight would be incredibly helpful, thanks for reading."
For anyone that has been laid off or fired. Are these some warning signs? Or am I being paranoid?,"
I work in billing and collections for a regional healthcare system in the Northeast. As a result of COVID19, we’ve been told by management that revenue is projected to drop by millions of dollars. 

My supervisor told the team yesterday that productivity is going to be tracked closely and now is the time to crank it up to avoid “outsourcing and layoffs.” Healthcare has been hit super hard in terms of layoffs across the country. 

Now with that being said, I like the organization because they like internal promoting. I’d like to get a position in HR as that is my career goal and am using my current position as a stepping stone.  However, they are not posted any vacancies in the organization’s HR department. 

However, I received an offer for the contact tracer job for the state of New York which pays $20,000 more than my current job. I don’t know what the benefits look like yet and may have that position until May 2021 or less, it depends on the spread of the virus. 

PS: I am not an expert in the line of work I do but I engage and actively seek opportunities to learn. However, I am the least experienced out of my 10 member team. 

With that being said, both options feel a bit risky. However, I went over through some work I did yesterday with my supervisor to improve my understanding of my new workflow. I’m being moved to a new position in the revenue cycle since we have a new hire. And the end of the zoom call..she asks if I sign a form saying that I have received additional education...I have a feeling layoffs/outsourcing or just being fired is coming for me and they’re gathering a paper trail. Am I being paranoid? How do I leave on a good note without ruining any opportunities of coming back in  the near future in an HR position?"
"Hello, I was told my entire department will be outsourced in August.","I'm new here so bear with me. I was just told a couple of hours ago that my entire department is getting outsourced. I've been with this company for five years and I will get severance. My question is, what are the best methods nowadays to look for a job? I've seen linked in and other apps. The situation with covid-19 isn't helping my anxiety either. I'm in New Jersey by the way."
Do companies have any expenses when their workers are furloughed? CA,"Stupid question

But I was wondering if a company in CA is furloughing, let's say, 30 employees. No insurance/benefits. No work, No salary. What are the expenses that may incur from this? 

My company just laid off most of us after 3 months of furlough. They are bringing some people back and they told me that they are still planning on bring everyone back (BS?) but unfortunately at this time they don't enough money due to lost work/clients (covid). Then why just not keep us ""furloughed"" on ""unpaid leave of absence"" indefinitely then?"
Just Got Fired For The First Time And Not Sure How To Move Forward,"I’ve worked in commercial insurance for the last five years, and was let go this morning on a technicality. I think the company is downsizing staff due to current events but they constantly brag about “never laying people off” so they’re letting people go for very minor mistakes. Annoying but not important.

I’ve been looking for another job for a couple weeks as-is, since I’ve started having doubts about the company so I’m almost relieved; I have industry qualifications and 5 years of professional experience (I’m 27). I’m just not sure what the best way to proceed is, if I want to stay in the industry or try branching off to something else. I have two 4 year degrees as well but in poli sci and history. 

How have you guys navigated this before? I have enough in savings and resources to be ok for a while but this is new for me and I’m definitely feeling like the rug has been pulled from under me.."
Employer not carrying on furlough from July 31st,"This post is not for me, it’s for my partner, and I know from previous posts in here there is a lot of knowledgable people in here.

Sooo my partner worked in the same cafe as I, I was a team leader he was a normal cafe staff. (He went above and beyond organising events for them for free can I add which brought them in thousands) anyways we both had this letter/email saying they can’t continue the furlough from the 31st July. I’m guessing this is because they don’t want to top it up 10 percent. And they won’t be many hours for him to be invited back to work but he hasn’t said he hasn’t got a job... which is confusing anyways. Are they allowed to do this?? And just looking for general advice to see if anyone else has had this done to them. 

I got the same letter but was planning on leaving anyways as I have a better paying job now."
Poor furlough management,"I was furloughed from my company mid-week through email. No phone call, just a very impersonal two sentence email. I have a meeting with my direct manager tomorrow who doesn’t seem to have had a say in the matter with management. Do I schedule a separate call with management to air my concerns about how I was furloughed? I am concerned that my concerns that I speak with my manager about won’t get up to managements ears. 

For context, I’ve been at the company a little over a year. I am the 2nd most senior person on my team. I don’t get paid extraordinarily more than others on my team, and have been rewarded for my hard work in the past. 

I wasn’t given a reason for why I was furloughed and have been working from home the past several months due to the pandemic. The company chose to keep assistants but furlough roles with more responsibilities."
Been laid off and covid 19 is making it hard to get employed.,"I’ve been laid off since June 1. At first I was enjoying the break but now I am worried because i don’t know when I will be employed again. ESPECIALLY Since this pandemic has basically ... ruined the economy. 

I just want to know if anyone feels my pain.... I’m currently dealing with unemployment and now trying to find a job is painful. It seems like there’s less out there I want to apply too...."
Anybody have any luck sharing info on the layoff.com site?,I don't know who moderates the boards on the layoff.com but I have had no posts get posted onto that site lately. My content stays within the guidelines of what is allowed. It is the only place I can communicate with co-workers anonymously.
Employer gave me a letter at the start of the week saying I'll likely be made redundant at the end of the week.,"So my Employer gave me a letter basically stating that due to the business, specifically my branch, running at a loss and that I have been chosen as a likely way to cut back costs. they've given me a week notice and in the letter they specifically state that it's very likely. Now I thought that this was very strange, I would have thought that if a business is writing a letter like this they've already made a prior decision.  Any ideas what the purpose behind a letter like this might be?

Someone pointed out to me that this might be some sort of scare tactic to try and get me to leave without paying me out, is that a possibility?

Lastly, are there any downsides to being made redundant that I am too naive to see right now? Because this in my eyes is actually a good thing as I'd been looking for another job already and now I'll be getting a payout along with finally being able to move on."
I’m pretty sure a new employee at my company got me fired. I have no idea how or what he said.,"Hi, all. I’m in a tough spot that I’m having a hard time moving on from. 

For a year I have been the marketing director of a medical manufacturing company. I had a killer year with lots of little victories. I felt, for the first time, that I was really part of a team at work. I never received negative feedback, even when explicitly asking for it. I was well-liked around the office and people respected my work. I put in long hours and dedicated a lot to my job. Things were going great. 

COVID came around and I was temporarily furloughed, along with most of the company. No problem. I spoke with my boss (VP) over the phone during this period and she ensured me I’d be back soon. Then communication stopped, abruptly. 

A week later, an HR person who I did not know called to tell me my position was being eliminated. I was gutted. Still no word from either of my bosses, which seemed bizarre to me. Others in the company had no idea I was being terminated and the ones who did were just as confused as me. I asked the HR director repeatedly why I was being laid off, as it simply didn’t sit right with me. He insisted every time that it was COVID related and not due to performance whatsoever. 

Now, weeks later, my position is being posted again. Same responsibilities. Same pay. It is clear that I was lied to about why I was let go. 

I have a gut feeling that a new employee who was taking over the PR department has something to do with it. He was compulsively obsessed with the President of our company and would do literally anything to please him. He was constantly listening in on everyone’s conversations and reporting it back to people. He would talk to me all the time and even called me while I was on furlough to catch-up. I honestly believe he told the President things I said in private, or lied about things I said. 

I know I should let it go, but I am torn up and want closure. Would it be appropriate to ask a friend still at the company why I was actually fired?"
How likely is it that I am going to be fired?,"So not only has my boss and other manger mentioned that I haven’t been performing well, but one of them also asked “do you want to be here?” To which, I pretty much said “no.” They also mentioned I wasn’t making a very good case for myself (obviously to keep me around). I’ve pretty much sealed the deal that I’m going to get fired right?"
I am a 16 year old from Colorado and I’m struggling to get a job,"
I had a seasonal job at a garden Center and got laid off because there were barely any customers. I’ve applied for dozens of jobs and have gotten no responses and I don’t know what to do, I really want to work and need the money. Does anyone have any suggestions of what I should do or where I should apply?"
I was told today my job doesn’t exist anymore. I had no indication that this would happen to anyone let alone me and I dont know what to do.,"Was told at 9am that today was my last day. Found out later some real trash stuff on when my supervisor found out/how long they waited to tell me/how they told me. Just some bad juju in there. So I’m still salty and mourning and coping and it’s not going well so I need to focus on what’s next. 

I’ve filed for unemployment, but with COVID-19 I really just don’t think I’ll find a job for months. At least. Unemployment is half of what I have been making and living okay with. Not spending a ton, but spending 3/4 of my income each month on living. I’m scared that I won’t be able to cover my cost of living if I don’t get a job in the next month or so. 

I’m trying to look at this as a sign to make a move like I have been wanting to do and trying to rationalize doing; but will unemployment transfer states? It doesn’t feel financially smart to move states when I don’t have a job and the world is sick. But if I don’t move now, I’ll start a new job and then really not be able to move for years.

Any advise? What are you all doing to stay sane, or positive. I just want to wallow. I’m a pessimist and this is not going to go well from what I can see. What are y’all doing to stay busy? How can I find a job in this climate? Any experience with moving states like this? Anything would be really great. 

TL DR: lost my job and I’m salty, pessimistic, and lost. Help? Suggestions?"
Laid off then rescinded without any discussion with HR or manager - what should i do?,"May 26th - I was notified through my manager that I am being laid off from the company that I work at (large tech fortune 500 company) due to covid. They gave me one month notice and the final day of work was supposed to be June 24th. Severance package was going to be couple of months worth of salary.

June 12th - This is 2 weeks before my final day. I got an email saying that my separation from the company had been rescinded. Meaning, they were no longer laying me off. I had no prior conversation with my manager or HR regarding this happening. They just notified me without even speaking to me or any discussions.

Now, I have no severance package, but still have my job. I guess most people will look at this as a good thing but I was never really happy working at this company and had accepted the layoff and was moving on looking for new opportunities in this tough market.

I'm pretty upset that they are toying with my emotions and laying me off/bringing me back as they feel. I was happy about dropping all the BS work/stressload I had at the company. And then now I have to go back.

Is it just me, or is it messed up for the company to do that? What if I had gotten an offer from another company, and all I had was the choice was to move on without a severance. That's such BS.

What would you guys do, stay at the company or fight to get the severance package and be laid off?"
How okay is it to tell your friends outside of work that your company is about to lay people off?,"My job just announced that they are cutting employee costs to be more aligned with “competitors” and that we have like two weeks to sign up for a severance agreement...or else.

Seems like maybe it might be good to talk to some people outside of work, since everyone at work is on pins and needles and scared out of their minds and of course management is tight-lipped."
I just got confirmation that I will be fired in the upcoming weeks. How do I overcome the shame and the dreadful anxiety of this unstable future?,"I love my job. It's my first job, I've been there for a year and a half, and I work in healthcare marketing. However it's a demanding position and my managers wanted someone more senior than me but didn't have the resources. They have been chronically unsatisfied with my work (although there are some aspects that I master) and think I'm just incompetent and will never be able to negotiate the learning curve.

So today I got the confirmation that they are having talks about laying me off and starting a new team from scratch, without me. I'm very grateful that I got a heads up and I started applying elsewhere but how do you get over the shame of being fired? of not being good at a job that I love?

I keep seeing my coworkers evolve, achieve milestones and get promotions and being good at what they do and I just feel so ashamed. I can't deal with this reality. I'm overwhelmed with the anxiety of not knowing what awaits me in the future.

Help me, give me some perspective because I feel so hopeless and bleak."
Would it be unreasonable/too much for me to ask for a change of a title upon my lay off?,"Backstory (details you can check my history in personalfinance sub)

I was furloughed for 3 months. Before the furlough, I worked on a project and was successful in getting the approval needed from the vendor (bring new clients/works/businesses). I even designed internal workflows for the company. The project was originally assigned to someone else but because I had background in this specific project from my previous jobs, I took it over. I was told I'd come back but alas they laid me off.

Now, my boss offered me time to talk to him when he delivered the news (lay off) to me. He's also willing to write me a recommendation and he said that I'm on the top of his list for a call back should things get back to normal.

I know I'm not getting my job back but at the very least I'd like to be recognized for my work esp since that project was outside of my daily duties.

I can't give you the details of my industry, job or the project because of confidential reasons.

So let me make things up for the sake of simplicity

Example:

My company works in chicken meat business. I was hired as a delivery guy for grocery stores. The company is trying to expand the business by delivering the meat to a famous fast food restaurant. Since, I have backgrounds doing this in my previous job. I'm familiar with this specific chain's standards, meat requirements and procedure. I was able to get my company approved in delivering their meat to this fastfood chain. 

My title when I was hired something like ""Delivery/Driver"". I'd like to ask my boss that my last title at this company to be something like ""Senior Fast Food Delivery"" guy.


Would this be unreasonable? It wouldn't cost them money? It would look good on my resume and a way of keeping things good between us?"
I just recently got laid off due to COVID cut backs and I'm nervous that I will have to uproot my family and move to another state/country. Any words of comfort or advice from anyone who has had to move for a job?,"The reason I might have to move is that I haven't been able to find very many jobs that I qualify for in my area.  I am a mechanical design engineer and all the jobs within driving distance that are hiring right now are medical device companies that require experience in medical device design, which I don't have.  I have been applying anyways, but I keep getting automated response saying that I don't have the right qualifications for the job.

I grew up in southern California and my and my wife's whole family live here so it would be hard to leave them all. Also, our kids are young and just started making their own friends and I know it will be really hard for them to leave their friends and have to try and make new ones since it took them quite some time to build the friendships they have here.

I'm also nervous for myself since I have never lived anywhere else. I know where to go and where not to go, where to eat and where not to eat. It has taken a lifetime to learn all that I know about where I live and I still keep learning and it stress me out a little thinking about having to start over."
My director asked me for a list of my tasks. Am I getting laid off?,"I work in FP&A for a public service company. 

On Thursday I got an email from my director asking me to create a list of the tasks I was working on and how much time I spent per month on each by Friday EOD. In the email he said the company was going through a little reorg and he wanted to figure out workloads. He wanted to see granularity in what I was doing. The email was only sent to me and not the rest of my department. 

Does this sound like the beginning of a layoff? Considering he said company reorg and the fact he asked me for a list of what I was working on really sounds suspicious. I've only been with the company since October 2019 and so I'm the most junior in the department and youngest. 

Obviously I don't want to lose my job because of financial reasons but what I'm also really worried about is my career growth. Before this job I worked for a year in Accounts Payable. With only seven months of FP&A experience I'm not sure if I'll be able to find another similar role, especially during this time. I was supposed to be begin training on how to forecast but that had to be delayed. 

When the pandemic started, the company had us going remote and it was business as usual. I still had my daily tasks to do and several times my director would even delegate some work on me. We have Microsoft teams meetings and none of my coworkers were giving me the could shoulder or anything. I've made some mistakes but I fixed them quickly and wasn't reprimanded or anything. So I think at best I know I'm not getting fired. 

I don't know. I guess I'm just a little more on edge just because of whats been going on. Does anyone have any experience with reorgs? Any insights? Advice? This is in San Diego."
Can severance be negotiated? (CA),"I was laid off recently due to company restructuring, and I am dissatisfied with the severance package that is currently on the table.  I don't want to sound greedy, but the total payout is less than one month's salary, which is lower than what I was hoping for.  And with the pandemic going on, I feel that it's not unreasonable to expect a larger payout during this time if they are looking for a clean closure.  I understand they are under no legal obligation to provide severance pay.

I would describe this company as one of the big players in the consumer electronics category, and I have been here for a few years now.

Are there any general rules of thumbs on what can usually be negotiated and what I shouldn't touch, and how to approach this conversation with HR?

Would I be laughed at if I suggested to quadruple the payout to make it 1month of pay per every year worked, and extended health benefits until the end of the year?  I have never been in this situation and definitely am out of touch with where to set my expectations."
As a temp working for the state until the Covid-19 layoffs. I may get my position back right away. Do you have to re-apply for your old job or will you just get hired back?,I'm researching the stock market and may decide to sell or buy shares depending on how fast the unemployment rate shrinks. The very positive jobs report that came out today suggests people might be able to go straight back to work soon. But I'm guessing. Any thoughts?
I’m a laid-off Recreation Manager at a high end beach resort with an open mind about my next step. Looking for suggestions.,"The title explains my situation. I graduated with a bachelors degree in Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management in 2016. I’ve been working in hotels for the past four years, but the recreation side of hotels may be a tough place to find work for a little while. I’ve been open to starting a new career path since pre-Covid times, but now seems like the time to actually make that happen. I have no idea what I’d like to do though. 

What are some industries that are possible to break into during these times without previous experience, and what are the steps to become successful in those fields? I am open to all suggestions!"
Should I be looking for a new job now?,"3 of my companies branches(child care centers) have closed within the last year. Two were due to low enrollment alone, then the third one was that mixed with Covid. My location is the highest earner in the area much less within the company, so I've never been worried until now. We were also were all sold to new higher-ups about 6 months ago, which I didn't think anything of at the time but now I feel like it means something. Should I be looking, are these warning signs or is it normal buisness, not everyone can make it?"
Getting laid off next week. How should I go about it?,"So I'm getting laid off from an e-commerce company. My predecessor didn't leave me anything to work with when I first got the job, and now my manager wants me to stay 2 extra weeks to teach another person to run my code and help him understand how it works. I don't have a problem leaving them the code, but do feel very unmotivated to teach the other guy (no one taught me how to do my job). Added to this my severance they're giving me amounts to half a month of pay. How should I go about this? Has anyone been a similar situation?"
"I got fired for the first time, and I feel terrible","I expect similar stories/experiences about this story, how you felt about it, and how you embraced yourself for the future.

I have not been working for this company for long. I personally got along with my supervisors and I had the skills to do the job. The clients whom I worked with were happy and the target was met. With that being said, the reason I was fired was due to my working method that does not conform to the working method the company enforces. I was fixated on my previous method and tried changing to the method the company enforces. However, the final decision (my getting fired) proved that the change wasn't enough.

I guess that I was uncomfortable with the different method that is enforced by the company. Logically, I know that this is supposed to be just an experience from which I can learn: that companies may have different methods which may not suit you. I know that I have the skills and time, but I just can't shake off this feeling of.... Rejection, I guess? It's like you're focusing on the bad things that have been going on and forgetting about the good things. I guess this partially has to do with the fact that I usually don't fail at the things I don't expect to fail, and it seems like this one just isn't one of them. In the end, I think that it was the best decision for us.

There are some clients whom I was working with. Although I am sure that the company has informed them about this, would it be a good practice to personally inform them about my discontinuation to further work with them? Should I ask for a letter of reference and/or a letter describing why I was fired? Should I send a final thank you email for the employment opportunity?"
"They wanted to lay me off, now they want me to change teams. Does this mean I am safe?","Hi everyone. I started my current (and first) job two years ago. I work in a small department highly specialized. I’m a junior and there are two account directors, let’s call them Frank and Grace. 
According to my manager (one of my directors, Frank), there are things I did very well but one specific task that was impossible for me to success at. Over the years, my inability to perform this task became a major weak points in my evaluations.
Then my manager Frank quit, which made the other director Grace the sole decision-maker in our small team. Now at the head of our department (again, just the two of us), she decided she wanted a change because I was unable to perform that specific task, making her job difficult. So we started talking about lay offs, how they wanted to part from me and recruit someone else.

Then covid happened. We were all working from home and the HR director told me that they decided against laying me off considering the climate (which is incredible). She told me we’d talk about the lay off once everyone was back at the office with the covid under control.

Then last week, Grace, now my manager, told me they had discussions about me with the higher ups and they thought it would be a good move for to change teams and do other tasks. She told me I would remain working with her but I would also work on some other stuff that she thinks I’m good at. 
In order to make it even more official, they changed my manager. I’m still working for Grace but my manager will be someone else.

When I asked Grace why they would move me to another team if I was going to leave in a few months, she said ‘think of it as trying to find a better fit for you’

Does this mean they’re not going through with the lay off and I’m safe?"
I was laid off but the company received a government bailout and layoffs were rescinded. What are my obligations?,"As outlined in the titled, I received a written letter issuing my layoff on March 30th. My boss texted me that they're paying us regardless of available work.

However my issue with this all is that I am due for a raise, it's been two years and I've seen <50 cent (CAD) pay increase across that whole time (and I'm already underpaid as it is). My question is am I obligated to accept the recall of layoffs? I'm ready to walk away. I have two job offers on the table and a third in the works. 

Can I essentially treat this as a job offer and negotiate for a higher pay? I expected to get a new official offer essentially rather than ""hey jk about the layoffs come to work monday"""
Am i being targeted to get laid off?,"I work as a dietary aide and my supervisor pulled me in to talk about my performance review. He said that it looked bad but he thought what the review said was completely wrong about me. 

I didn’t understand why this particular supervisor thought of me so badly, especially since i thought he knew me well. What was even more funny was that this particular supervisor gave a good review of a close coworker of mine who is honestly the slowest worker in our department lol.

Is it usual for yearly reviews to have to be a talk with a supervisor? If so what could it mean?"
"Laid Off, Not Sure I Can Work 2 More Weeks","Almost every employee was laid off in March when we had to shut down due to stay at home orders. I've been working at home on a W-9 as a contractor for the past month, very limited hours. They decided on Friday to re-structure the corporate office to eliminate three positions to save money, including mine.

They want me to continue working for two more weeks, and have said that I can use office resource to job hunt during that time. At the end, I'll get my accrued vacation time paid out. However, I don't know if I can do it. I worked a little bit today, but they basically gave all of my responsibilities to another person with zero experience so they could lay me off. I'm just so hurt, frustrated, and angry. For my mental health's sake, I don't know how I'm supposed to work with these people for two more weeks after being cast aside.

What happens if I tell them that I can't work any more? I understand I'd end up forfeiting the vacation pay. Is there legal recourse they could take against me? What would they be allowed to tell potential employers who call while I'm job searching? Would this affect unemployment, since I technically filed and was approved when I was initially laid off a month ago?"
Is my job being dissolved,"10 of my coworkers and I were laid off due to COVID 19. Since then my boss has brought back everyone but 2 of us (myself included). I’ve heard through the grape vine my job responsibilities have been given to my Co workers who were brought back when I wasn’t hired back. My boss isn’t giving any straight answers about why me and my co worker were not rehires when they received their loan, basically I think my position may be dissolved. How can I get a straight answer on this. Any tips? I’ve never been through something like this..... also my boss referred to my co worker as her job title/ my job title (I work for a small company so she wouldn’t be in the department I think she literally is being given my title) the other day in an email- really makes me want to confront him about his plans for my return to work."
Teammate was fired without cause. Should we all be jumping ship?,"Hi Reddit. For reference, I'm in California.

I work on a small team within a larger international organization of about 200 employees. We've been fully remote since the state's shelter-in-place order was announced. Today a member of my team, who I often work closely with, was fired without known cause. Our manager asked to meet with him in person at the office this morning, and he was instructed to bring his computer.

He had been there for about two years and never received any kind of disciplinary action or even casual talk about his performance. Arguably, he is the most talented member of our team. He was enjoyable to work with and conducted himself professionally.

He called me after the termination to tell me he wasn't given a reason by either our manager or the HR director, both of whom were in the meeting. He explicitly asked why and they refused to answer him. I am stumped and also very freaked out.

Our company has been in the middle of negotiations with a venture capitalist firm, although as far as I know nothing has been signed or made official. However, my coworker told me this was not framed to him as a layoff--it was unambiguously a termination.

I guess I have two questions. How freaked out should I be? My manager called me later in the morning to notify me and tell me my job is safe, but that doesn't feel very comforting right now. Given the state of the world, looking for another job isn't likely to be very fruitful for at least the foreseeable future.

When I was hired (less than a year ago), I requested an employee handbook but was told that none exists. On the phone with my manager today, I asked if we have any kind of formal disciplinary system (to address performance issues before termination) and she said no. Both of these factors seem to open the company up to a lot of liability. Is it worth reaching out to an employment lawyer just to understand my rights?

"Just laid off, needs some advice.","Ok, due to all the stuff going on, I just got laid off. Well before I got laid off I was in the progress of moving in about 3 to 4 months. Obviously getting laid off put a halt to that. My question is, should I get a job where I currently reside now and only work up until the date I move or take a 3-4 month employment gap and just start applying for jobs now in the city I’m moving to. 

I live in a small city so with all this going on, jobs are few and far between. Is a 3-4 month employment gap look bad on a resume if you have a legitimate excuse? Also I know 3-4 months isn’t a solid number and it could be longer since I’m not guaranteed a job within that timeframe."
"Scored a full-time position with a mortgage company, but I'm worried about job security.","Hi all!,

So I just graduated graduate school but my major (film production) is getting hit hard by COVID-19 so I  applied for a lot of other jobs, and got a full-time remote job with a big name mortgage company. I took it because of the lack of options and to avoid unemployment but looking at Glassdoor etc., a lot of people mention lay offs after the house buying season ends towards the end of summer. I was wondering if there is anyone here who was in a similar position at a mortgage company and if you got laid off ever or if you were able to stay on throughout the year (for reference my position is entry-level disclosure analyst). All help and replies are appreciated. Stay safe y'all!"
"Seeking Advice: My company is based in travel, just slashed my salary by 25% for 4 months, and has laid off people in other departments. Is it time to start looking?","It can be hard to motivate yourself to seek change.  I'm an accountant and a Financial Analyst.  

My company now isn't the best in terms of culture, but I've learned what I do and I'm just chilling there. The pay isn't great, but it isn't bad either.

I'm working by Wall Street in NYC.

Do I now look out? Or am I being delusional by praying that this Covid19 nonsense will end in a month and my company can be saved?

It's really complacency and fear at this point for me, I've only been at this new job 4-5 months! But its going to fail if people don't travel!"
Only a high school diploma but 8 years of experience. How hard is this going to be for me?,"Hi all. I was with my company for 8 years. Started in the call center and worked my way up to an operations management position. The company was in the buisness of travel and unfortunately my position was eliminated. I am devastated. 

I filed for unemployment today but am starting to look for jobs. I feel without a degree under my belt, I am essentially screwed. I’m 29 and unfortunately had to work instead of go to school to help support my family. 

I know it’s going to be hard to find a Job due to COVID but I’m worried that it’s going to be even harder to find something due to have no college degree. Especially one that paid as well as my last employer. 

Any recommendations? Is this going to be damn near impossible for me? I still feel like this is a nightmare I’m going to wake up from, still can’t believe it."
Writing a letter to employer to re-hire an employee?,My manager got laid off recently and there will be some reorganization in the company. Would sending a letter to the higher-ups with positive comments about my manager influence their rehiring decision later on? Would really like to see my manager back to work.
am i getting laid off?,"last saturday i had an accident, and fell. it was a hard fall and i bruised my body up pretty good (busted lip, swollen nose, etc). so they gave me two weeks from work. last sunday i let my work know and sent them the doctors note which has a return date on it.

i got a text message from my boss today asking if I was available for a call later, she also included the HR guy in the text. i gave them all the info they needed, so i have a feeling this call is going to lay me off. before i went on leave i saw a ""private meeting"" on the calendar. because of covid i've had to setup other meetings regarding different employees' roles. i've seen the unemployment letters stack up, and  i've seen the number of paychecks get smaller and smaller every two weeks.

should i be concerned that i may be laid off (or furloughed)? i feel like since i haven't been in for the last week they've had time to assess whether or not my role is needed. the last time that someone was sick and had to take time off did get laid off."
On standby and just found job listing for my position,"I've been on standby since the start of March. I don't mind it, I'm actually making more on unemployment then I usually earn (thanks to behind grossly underpaid for my field). But that's okay, I like my job!

I checked in with my employer yesterday to see if I can return to work, part time, later this month. I was told it's uncertain, things are slow. I told them not to worry, I'm doing fine, I hope things look up! I have been promised several times that I will have a job when this is over, ""no matter what."" 

Today I found a job listing from my company for my position. They are trying to hire someone to do my job, with a year experience mind you, for $12.25/hr... I guess no one told them minimum wage in my state is $13.50. I make 14 bucks an hour. 

I feel like sending a friendly text that says "" FYI, minimum wage is $13.50! :-)"" but really I'm offended and hurt. I could have found a better paying job a year ago, but I *liked* working here. I chose familiarity and what I perceived to be appreciation, over money. But I guess they decided I was too expensive. 

Not sure how to approach them about this, or if I should act like I never saw it and just aggressively jump into a search for a new job. It's a very small company (less than 5 people) so this really hurts me on a personal level. I felt like these guys were my friends. 

 Advice?"
My job laid me off with severence but is changing their minds and asking me to work for one more week to earn my severance pay. what do I do?,"I was laid off from my job yesterday and was told I'd be paid through march 31st. was also told mynlast day was yesterday the 23rd. 

half way through the day, they assigned me a project and told me I had to work the rest of the day and the  I was done. and theyd still pay me. 

at the end of the day they changed their minds and said in order to get my last weeks pay, I needed to do a project for them for the next week and they moved my lay off day to the 31st. 

how would you suggest handling this? I'm so mad about it and I'm not sure what's the best way for me to get my check and not work for the week as agreed upon in the layoff conversation."
"Laid off and denied unemployment, where to look?","As the title says I found out that since I was only at my last job 2 weeks they can’t use that job for unemployment and since I left the previous job voluntarily I get nothing. I’m 3 weeks away from finishing my bachelors, I’m 30 with 3 kids and a good amount of restaurant and sales experience and am starting an MBA program in the Fall. And what  do you know, those are the two business getting hit the hardest and not hiring... I managed to secure a job as an agency recruiter but that’s where I got laid off from, and haven’t heard anything about them hiring me back. 

I spent most of my life savings being off work for 8 months prior to taking the agency job mostly cause one of my kids was sick and I couldn’t find the right job to start working again. Where am I suppose to look so that I don’t get corona and can make a decent wage? Seems like we’re just going to suffer as we ride this out."
Can I ask for pay stubs after I have been let go?,"So I was temporarily laid off in March and now permanently laid off from my job due to low business relating to covid restriction. Till Dec 31st 2019 my former workplace was issuing paper and online pay stubs which showed how much I made in a 2 week period. From Jan 2020 they moved to an app to record clock in and clock out and all the pay information was on the app. When I was temporarily laid off in March, I was denied access to the app so I couldn't access pay information. Can I ask for the pay stubs which I am missing? Location:- BC, Canada"
In a temporary lay off situation is it advisable to update my LinkedIN to state I am Open to New Opportunities?,"I’ve been “temporarily laid off” by the company I worked for. Both my manager and the HR person kept reiterating to me to keep in mind that this lay off is considered temporary, they want to bring me back and don’t want to see me move on. Every time I kept saying things like well that’s too bad I loved working with this company, the assured me that they want to bring me back. 

However there is no definite date of rehire which in my mind translates to no guarantee whatsoever. For example, what if the company struggles so bad it goes under or what if they can no longer sell the types of projects I worked on to our clients? 

I’d love to wait and get rehired HOWEVER the other part of me would love to be employed and working. 

If I updated my LinkedIN status to “Seeking New Opportunities.” They will see if, Will this make them not hire me back or make them have a negative opinion of me? 

I’ve never been “temporarily laid off” off before."
Has anyone had the good fortune of getting a job that put you in charge of the person that fired or laid you off?,"ngl, it's a fantasy of mine! 

The only person I know that's done it is Jack Dorsey at Twitter -- but I was hoping to hear of more low-profile instances: either you joined another company and then your old manager applied, or you rejoined the company at a level above your old boss."
"during one of my summers at university I was fired from a job for a very unfair reason, I am now a graduate looking for full time work and I really do not want this affecting me, can employers find out that I had been previously fired without a reference call?","So I do have this job in my resume for the month time frame I was there because I really worked hard at this job and was let go to open up a position for the supervisors friend, anyways now that I am looking for full time work I was just wondering if employers can find out I had been fired without me giving them a reference from that job"
How do I know I’ve been temporarily laid off or actually fired? Haven’t gotten any word...,"(Reposting with a better title)

I’m (21F) digital press operator who has been working on and off full time and part time due to college. I’ve been at the company for a little close to 3 years.

A few weeks ago in March I was called by an employee I’m close to and was told “not to come in until you hear otherwise”. My coworker who I worked with is still working (she’s full time) and we had someone new to basically cover for me when I wasn’t around due to class (she is also considered full time). I’m currently in school still and have been doing my class work from home.

My question is how can I know I haven’t been fired? I plan on quitting after college in June but I just want to know if I still have my position at the company for the time being when things clear up.

I haven’t filed for unemployment in PA yet since my schedule has been me bending backwards for school but it is on my list of things to accomplish. I did receive an email from my boss (one sent to every employee in response to the virus)."
Paycuts and new jobs,"Just informed we've been made to take paycuts and that certain jobs were removed at my current role. I think I'm going to start applying to new roles, but can I just be honest in explaining to new employers? Saying I would like to come here as a security blanket doesn't seem like that great of a sell. 

I work in marketing/advertising."
I was laid off this morning. The company has encouraged me to reach out with any questions I might have when I’m ready. What should I ask?,"I was laid off a few hours ago because my company says they can’t find enough work given the difficult financial times. I worked for a boutique management consulting firm in a big city in Canada, in a small team of five. I had only been with them for 6 months, straight out of grad school, so I understand why it was me. This hasn’t happened to me before, so I’m pretty shaken up and finding it challenging to convince myself it wasn’t something I did. To add to my stress, my husband recently moved to Canada and has had trouble finding work himself. So now we’re both home without work, living off savings until either of us can find a job. 

I’m much more stressed out than my husband is right now and feeling very emotional. The company says they would offer a great reference and would like to help me in my job search. They’re also paying 4 weeks severance. 

When I’m ready to speak to them again, what should I ask? In the meeting, I sat blankly staring at the two owners and couldn’t really speak at all, so I haven’t said much to them. I think I want to take the weekend to collect my thoughts and then approach them with a few questions. Any suggestions of what I should ask and how I get over this feeling of embarrassment?"
Pending Layoff - Suggestions?,"My job has informed me that my position if being moved to a different business unit ""soon,"" and that I should begin seeking alternative employment. There was no malintent, it was said matter of factly and as soon as my manager learned of this, I was informed - Which was before there were really any real details known about the situation other than the current business unit will no longer support that position. 

* It's possible I'll change units to go with the work, but it's my impression that is unlikely.
* I'm searching internally, but I have a very specific set of (limited) skills that are a little out of place in the company at large (Technical Writer in a financial company). That fact plus the whole ""world in flames"" part of the situation means there aren't a ton of applicable options. I'm applying and stretching my skills, but I'm not holding my breath.
* I've prepared my updated resume and applied to a few specific listings externally, but my main concern (below)\* pertains to this.

I was told this in a relatively unofficial capacity as far as I understand, not in a formal ""this is your 2-week notice"" function. I assume that is coming, but I think my employer is hoping I'll find a job of my own accord without them having to dedicate any resources to me, either in the form of an assisted job search or severance. This last point is my biggest question mark:

* I've been with this company (which is large and worldwide) for 9 years and technically hold a manager title. I believe I am due some severance, should that be the result, but I don't know what to expect. Can anyone fill me in?
* Specific questions include:
   * What kind of compensation should I expect to be included?
   * Insurance?
   * What recompense is there for unused vacation days?
      * If there is none, should I begin burning through my days now? Is that most certainly to anger the powers that be?
   * I know there is supposedly an option to negotiate your severance package. Can anyone divulge to what extent?

\*I've basically been told that if I can find a job internally, take it, and if not, wait until I'm officially laid off before accepting something outside of the company, lest I voluntarily forego my potential for severance. That makes sense, but in the meanwhile, it's kept my external job search on a bit of a backburner (plus still performing my current job duties and OH YEAH WORLD FALLING APART, KIDS HOME, NO DAYCARE, etc.

I've loved my job and the company. It's only now, a week and a half after being told, that I'm starting to consider some of these harder questions.

Thanks all."
Laid off after four months,I got laid off today due to my position being eliminated post an acquisition.   It was a high level management position.   Should I update my resume to include this?  Will it be a red flag?   What should my next few steps be?  I already reached out to recruiters I know.   How do I get over this embarrassment?   Thanks.
"Just got laid off, did not see it coming, what is the next step?","I have another meeting in a half an hour with my boss to go over severance and potential internal positions I can apply to. I have been an amazing employee (promoted last year, rave reviews from everyone). Lay off isn’t performance related....

Any advice on how to go forward and how to act in the meeting?"
Starting to feel I will be fired soon,"Hey everyone,

Recently I spoke up about a certain topic and this week my workload has been given to others.  Trying to mentally prepare on what to do next and prepare my finances.  I have seen others eventually be told to not come to work because there is nothing for them to do.  The thing is I am a full time employee and I don’t want to quit until I have secured another full time job.

Has anyone else experienced this? How did you deal? What if I can’t find a full time job quick enough."
I lost my job yesterday,"This is the first time in my life that I’ve ever experienced this. I didn’t pass my probation after ten weeks in a job.

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with all of this? I’ve started looking for a new job but my confidence has taken a knock after being let go as they put it down to performance. Does anyone who’s been through this have any tips to get through? I’m feeling a bit lost."
Is it smart for the boss to fire someone simply because they believe someone isn’t happy?,"What would your boss think if they’re told you’re not happy with your salary and will be gone within a year? (They are unable to give you more because of the economic decline during the coronavirus)

Would they...:
1. Fire you the first chance they get
2. Resent you but not do anything 
3. Nothing will happen- they don’t care how you feel
4. Give you more money to try to keep you
5. Push you out
6. Not believe what they hear 100%"
How to change my career?,"Hey everyone. Hope you are all safe and healthy. I always been working in the restaurant business since I was 16yo and I am 33 now. I’ve been lay off work 3 weeks ago because of the vivid situation and it looks like even when all of this is over the restaurant business will not be the best choice. I have a master in hotel and management school but I was thinking about changing my all career. What do you think will be the easiest and most successful way to do it?

Company went through layoffs. Now the people that are left are ‘working through their severance period’,"As the title states, the company that I am with laid off a good portion of staff. The people that were just laid off got 60 days severance pay, and their PTO converted to hourly pay. 

I am one of the people that was retained. We were given WARN letters that basically said that we are closing May 13th. The company stated that we are essentially working through our severance period, and nothing further is promised after that. We are being told that there is a chance we will turn it around and the WARN letter will be amended. Privately, no one still here believes we will pull through, including several in or right beneath C-suite. I am under the assumption that I was retained to help liquidate assets. I feel I am being told that we might pull through this in order to keep me motivated to dump as much product as possible in this period.

Regardless, I can’t help but feel like the people that were simply laid off actually got the much better deal. I am now stuck here, filling multiple roles and have less time to look for a new job that I know I will soon need. Also, when I do get interviews, I will need to burn my PTO and will not get that paid out to me after we close. Do I have any recourse? I feel like I am being held hostage on a sinking ship. I am also hoping to use my boss and COO as references, so I can’t just walk out or get let go with cause. I don’t have the savings to do that either. 

Meanwhile, the people that were let go get paid severance, paid for their PTO and have two months completely free to look for a new job. Is there anything I can do?"
My job layed off everyone only to hire us in a different temporary position!,"I’ve only worked at my position since January. I really liked the role (marketing/sales), but the management was always shady to me.

Today we had an emergency meeting where the director of our department announced that all but 10% of our department would lose our jobs and be re-trained in a data entry. While I am thankful to have any job, I am just really confused. This temporary job could last 3 weeks to 7 months depending on consumer need, which then our boss would re-hire and retrain whoever she wanted of us.

There was no choice about this and the 10% was based on seniority/ our boss’ favorites.

Our salary/bonus structure was not really discussed for this new job. I have a day off for weekend getaway planned for Friday and I was told that weather I have that day off is to the discretion of my new boss, who I’ve never met before. 

I am really at a loss of what to do and what are my rights in this scenario? Is it time to jump ship and how do I spin this three months of marketing?"
Help Please. What can I do to encourage a person not to give up when it comes to finding a job?,"Help please. 

I'm trying to calm down a person in my family who was just recently let go from a job after a month. The reason why she was let go because of the coronavirus status. Which I don't think it was about the coronavirus. I think this issue was another employee who was jealous of the person in my family. I've been encouraging her not to give up to find a job. The person in my family put out so many resumes for a job. But, not a lot of people are calling back. I worry because the person in my family starts to get antsy. What can I do to encourage a person not to give up when it comes to finding a job?"
Going to be put on a second PIP - advice on next steps!,"I've worked at my company for about a year, but my boss recently had a formal conversation about my subpar performance. They laid out what needs improvement and performance review is in 2 months. It honestly sounds like I'm on the path to being put on a PIP. I'm pretty sure they've started documenting my mistakes, which is making me extremely nervous. I have taken steps to show some signs of improvement, but I don't know if it's enough.

I was put on a PIP at my last company with some overlapping areas of concern. It was not a good experience, and I certainly do not want to go through the same thing at this company.

While I genuinely believe my current boss is trying to help me improve, it's hard to not feel incompetent knowing this is the second time. My previous and current job required a similar skill set but are not the same. Should I start looking for another job or seek other types of jobs? Am I not cut out for my job?"
My company is downsizing and I am being retained. What questions do I need to ask my employers?,"I work for a small non-profit. We recently discovered that a portion of what we do will be getting outsourced. The company is still in negotiations, so there are still many things that my employer cannot disclose to me.

I have been told that my job is safe and will likely evolve, maybe into a leadership position. I am not sure about my direct reports yet. Both my boss and the CFO have assured me that I am essential and absolutely needed for the transition and beyond. While I believe they are straight-shooters, I also understand that they will also have the company’s best interests in heart.

This is my first real job and not really sure what people do in situations like these. What questions should I be asking my employers? Do I need to get other guarantees in place before agreeing to stay? I was hired as an “at will” employee so my job.

Thank you."
Need Advice emailing the CEO!,"Hello all, the description says it all but here are a few details:

So I was an intern for a big bank for a year and I was gonna return as FTE upon my graduation this summer.

But it happens that the CEO announced layoffs and cost-cutting strategies which ultimately lead to the hiring freeze within the institution. Now after knowing that I went to my manager to talk more about this and as a conclusion, it turns out that he couldn't do much and cannot certainly hire me back due to the hiring restrictions throughout.

I invested my time there expecting to return upon my graduation but now I can't just because of cost-cutting strategies. I have to look elsewhere finding a job and not going back to where I loved to work/ belonged to.

Now, I was thinking to email the CEO stating my situation about this matter and see if anything can be done. Is this a good idea to take this concern up to the CEO? If yes, what details should I include in the email? I read some articles on how to email the CEO, the first-line, subject line, and other things but your inputs would be valuable and helpful.

Thanks!"
Lost my first full-time office job yesterday and want some help,"Thankfully it was through no fault of my own (I hope?), they just couldn't afford to have me. The company was a startup in a way and while I knew that startups are notorious for not being able to continue the way they anticipate and that the position could be unstable, I didn't think it was going to be that soon. It's a bit of a bummer because I loved everything about this work and the people around me. I told everyone how much I loved everything about the company.

After being told this news, I went home and felt sorry for myself (only a few tears were shed!) and had dinner with my family as a consolation. But today I've filed for unemployment, made an outline of things to do while I have so much time on my hands (which includes a lot of time for applying for jobs) because I can't stand not having structure, and will be working on updating my resume.

Since I haven't been unemployed for the past 7 years, I'm almost at a loss of what to do. I'm a bit discouraged because I graduated from college 2 years ago with a BA in Social Science and stayed working at the daycare program while I've been searching for work up until September 2019. Before the daycare, I worked in retail for 4 years, the last year being a supervisor. Now I have a 2-month position for my only office job in marketing, a career that I want to pursue after having no direction to work towards. Just a few questions:

&#x200B;

1. How do I list the 2-month job on my resume? Should I even list it because it was such a short term position? If I do list it, how can I talk about it when it was a short amount of time?
2. Is there anything I should know about being unemployed? I know I need to keep busy, so I'm making sure that I'm continuing to take the online courses for marketing as I have been for the past several months so I can show that I serious about this, and the fact that I didn't go to school for this industry. And exercise for stress relief.
3. Should I just get another job as soon as I can, no matter what it is? I'm not talking about going back to part-time work, but another entry-level office job? I'm aware that I have bills/loans to pay, so that does add weight. I live at home now though.
4. I will also have no health insurance. I turn 26 next week. Happy birthday to me? What do I do about that?
5. If you don't have any answers to those questions, I'd still love to hear about anyone's past/current experience in any similar position!

Might be getting fired..in a month or sooner. How I do deal with the issue in the present and prepare for the future..,"So, my job has been going decently as far as my performance. Expect I made one small mistake that has potentially escalated into a bad chain of events. Like it was because I was clumsy..and was rushing to fix said issue which didn’t help fix it.

Won’t go into further details on here. So my manager sat me down and was like so explain your mistake. Which I had multiple times at this point..and retold my story. This leads up to higher ups apparently scrutinizing things ‘better’ now..and how said mistake was being looked into.

Which leads up to, my job isn’t in danger right now but if said issue escalates it could be grounds for termination. I have worked at this place for a year, haven’t had any serious violations, get along with my coworkers, don’t slack etc..

But now this is dropped in my lap and it sucks

So any advice on how to NOT walk on eggshells like I am not going to be ( possibly) gainfully unemployed  within a month. Any rock bottom to recovery stories.

How do I not panic about this..help."
How does being fired from a job affect one's future job possibilities?,"Like the title says. I'm not overly worried or anything, I just have that nagging question in the back of my head. I'm currently in the process of searching for my first job (highschooler here) and the prospect of being fired for a mistake I make has always been a slight issue of my overall mindset while looking for a job. Stuff like ""Will future employers look down on me being fired"", ""What kind of mistake would it take for me to be fired"", etc.. It's just something I've always wondered.

Thanks for any replies!"
I was laid off for the first time (context: I’m 20 years old),"My boss laid me off on 6:00pm on New Year’s Eve. This was my first time ever ‘losing’ a job; however, I am not the only one he has done this to. He’s done it to many employees on the same day, because there is no business. However, he said he would contact me in February, when it starts to get busy again. I work at a liquor store, in westchester NY (I miss the job mainly bc the pay was good and the coworkers were awesome) 

should I take this with a grain of salt? Or start looking for another job? 

I’m really lost as of what to do. It’s making me really anxious about not having a income as a part time student, even though I am blessed to have parents that will help me out. 

Sorry if this seems all over the place, I don’t know what else to do."
Girlfriends job is asking her to resign while she's on medical leave.,"My gf is a CNA and while she was at work a lot of her foot went numb and has been numb since. Her doctor told her not to return to work and gave her a medical note to give to her HR. Fast forward to this morning, HR calls back and straight up asks if ""she can resign."" My question is: Can they legally do this to her? And is there any legal recourse we can take against this? She would rather not lose her job since she needs it for income and depends on her employers day-care service. Any advice is appreciated."
Ghosted by my boss,"I recently got a job working at a restaurant. I was hired after booking tickets out of town to see family for Thanksgiving. I told my employer this as soon as I was hired. She said it was fine. In the two weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, I was put on the schedule sparingly and then my boss told me that she wanted to hold off on training until I returned from Thanksgiving. I asked her if she would definitely be able to give me hours once I returned. She said yes, she definitely would be able to give me about 20 hours a week. Then I got the schedule for the week I returned to town. I wasn't on the schedule. I texted her asking if what we had discussed previously with regards to my hours still stood. She never texted me back. So, I am off the schedule and not being texted back by my employer. I've been ghosted. I have a small check to pick up, but it will be so uncomfortable to do so I am putting it off. Advice?

&#x200B;

TLDR: I was ghosted by my employer."
Question about lay-off,"So I am a 20 year old college student. I have been working at this place since September, but they laid me, and many others, off on New Years Eve. He explained that if I email him my schedule for February he will put me in. 

For this, I obliged, I sent in my schedule, via email. After about 20 or so days, I send him a text, asking if I still had a position there because school was starting soon.  

I then sent him it again via text and he said: “let me see what I can do”

After this, I waited a while, 5 days to be exact, but I ask him again, if he was able to put me in. But no response. 

Is this normal? Am I overreacting? Should I believe him if he said I would be hired back February? Sorry for all the questions, I’m new to the job scene, and I’m just confused :/"
Update: my boss told me today that I oversold myself in the interview: I got fired yesterday.,"Well the title pretty much says it all. For background please check out my original post 2 weeks ago (link below) . What I wanted to say is that it's really starting to look like my boss set me up to get fired. I don't think they wanted me there in the first place but as I said it was a family owned company and I feel like their oldest brother who owns the company and hired me was the only one who liked me so the rest of them all had to kind of work with me. My boss (their sister) would literally not give me any work and then complain about me not working. She would not give me any guidance and then accuse me of not taking initiative, how am I supposed to take initiatives on things I don't know about. And then they told me in the firing meeting that they thought I would just come in and take over the responsibilities on my own. Seriously how? They literally told me nothing about what I'm supposed to do except help their sister. Thats the only job description I got. Besides, we didn't have much projects over the summer, and I perfectly worked them last one and another one I was working on. When they hired me they didn't look at my transcripts or anything although I offered. Geez people are weird man. I'm honestly glad I got fired. It's like a burden being lifted. Seriously feeling so much better. Because this whole time I really thought I was the one to blame. My confidence is back. 
Sidenote: people who spend that much time with their family seem weird to me.

"Should I tell people I was ""laid off"" or that I ""transitioned out?""","Based in the US.

Question (background to follow):

Should I talk openly with people about being laid off, or should I use the phrase ""transitioned out?""

I want to protect myself from being seen as either incompetent or bitter.  I wasn't fired, but I understand that some people hear ""laid off"" as ""fired.""  I want people to know that I am good at my job but didn't leave on my own accord (I'm still working through my emotions concerning the lay off).  I also don't want to come off as petty by wanting people to know that it wasn't my decision to be ""transitioned out.""  

I'm thinking of using the phrase ""transitioned out"" with everyone, and when asked 'why' responding with ""I was laid off because the company didn't have the capacity to keep me on staff. However, I continued to work with them as an independent contractor for a few months during the transition.""  I feel like that paints me in a good light while being honest, but would love to hear people's thoughts.

&#x200B;

Background:

At the end of 2018, I was given a different position, had my hours cut by about 85%, and moved from W2 to 1099.  None of this was a surprise as I knew there was a transition coming months previous.

Early this year I told my boss that I wasn't interested in the current position and would like to stay on with the company (we'll call them Company 1) if I could be doing something similar to the position I had previously.  I was told they ""didn't have the capacity to keep me on"" in that role and that they had given it to someone else (fresh out of college; I'm middle age). I told them I'd give them a month to find someone to replace my current role because it wasn't what I was hired for, didn't feel particularly good at it, and didn't enjoy it.  Boss told me he was sorry to see me go. I've since done some work with them as an independent contractor, as well as donated my time answering a couple of questions concerning my past role via phone calls and emails from people both in and out of Company 1.

My old employer used the term ""transitioned out"" in company emails to describe my leaving and wrote it in a way that made it sound like I had left for a position in another company (we'll call them Company B).  This bothered me as I had been working part-time for both companies for a few years and my work load at Company B didn't change at all after being laid off from Company 1.  Completely independent part-time jobs.

I went to Unemployment to see if I would qualify for anything.  I told them what happened and they said, ""OK, so you were laid off from Company 1."" Honestly, that's the first time I had thought of it that way.  I thought I had simply left, but I realized that I would still be working for Company 1 if it had been my choice. My old boss hadn't thought of it that way either, but did confirm with Unemployment that I had been laid off (which qualified me for a year of unemployment that I haven't had to use because I've been busy independently). I've since been telling myself and close friends that I was laid off from Company 1, but I don't know how to talk about it informally to other people, or professionally to others in the industry.

Terminated from job after 4 weeks because of “lack of fit”,"Hi guys, I was working at a new social work job in NYC starting from sept to end of oct. I haven’t posted about the termination too much because, out of coincidence, I ended up in the hospital the day after (unrelated) and had a fairly invasive surgery.

Anyways, the job, without providing much detail, as in a jail setting with male inmates. I am a early/mid 20s female. The day prior to my termination, I received an email from my supervisor to report to HR day after. No explanation. I get there and they hand me the paper stating I was terminated. I was told to return my ID then and that was my last day.

I asked them for a reason and they said “lack of it,” and they refused to provide further details, stating that they were “unaware” of the specific issues since HR is a “different department.” The paperwork says I was supposed to receive an “exit package,” but I have only received my paycheck, to which the pay ends the day i was terminated. My health insurance was cut off the day after (fair), but they took out money for the pretax subway card which I did not receive.

I have had friends who believe that there were discriminatory concerns, as I am the youngest female in that particular department, and had staff comment on my appearance, moreso than other staff members when wearing the same attire. I personally believe that there is no discrimination, and perhaps they didn’t feel I was mature enough for the job. However, I didn’t get any warnings of my performance with my supervisor, so I did feel a bit blindsided. 

I just want a neutral POV of what might have been the concerns they saw, and how can I avoid them in the future. But also to know if this is a fairly standard type of termination when fit is the issue. Looking back, I’m not too upset about the job loss, as the commute was 3+ hours and extremely unreliable. Thank you!

TL;DR: was terminated for lack of fit, there was no warning, I want to know if this is a normal termination process."

I'm a tradesman, and I just came back from trade school. On my first day back, on my way to a site, my boss told me that winter will be slow and he cant really bring me back full time, I'd have to remain on EI from trade school and work one shift a week to top up. When it gets busier in spring, he'd bring me back.

I didn't really know what to think of this. I thought he was straight up laying me off at first but I couldn't imagine why, I'm a pretty decent employee and we've had no issues so I don't know why he's lay me off for real. My second assumption is that, and this is true, we really are slow this time and he can't afford me at the moment but he doesn't want to lose me. He thinks this is a totally acceptable offer and that I'm just supposed to hang around all winter until it picks up? I told him I'd have to look elsewhere likely and he said that if I had to, then I have to and he's understand. He said if I came back in spring I'd have a raise and guaranteed hours.



What does this sound like to you guys? ANy clarification ask me, I'm around all day."
Are you always at a risk of losing your job in any job?,"I had a pretty bad experience in my previous company where I was terminated during my probation but from the very beginning of my time I was always reminded that I maybe fired if I don’t meet expectations. So everyday I used to wake up in fear of doing something wrong and not being able to fully concentrate on the tasks in hand.

Is this common for every workplace though? Or is it only me who had a pretty bad couple of months?"
My new current job was just posted again on LinkedIn. Should I be worried?,I just started a new job (2 weeks ago) and I noticed that yesterday it was reposted on LinkedIn. No one has told me if they have any issues with me so I’m confused. Has this happened to anyone else and it ended up being nothing?
My boss didn’t tell me that my position was being eliminated on the weekdays and only work weekends. What should I do?,"Location: Missouri, USA (small town) 

I’m a data entry specialist/on air personality/office specialist, basically a jack of all trades in the station. Typically work overnights but work early mornings quite often to help out. 

My boss has it in his head that the national wage is going up to $15/hour and so it has caused him to make snap decisions. He fired two of the girls in the office (who are single moms), a lot of people quit, and he eliminated my position to where I’m only working on weekends now starting January 9th according to the schedule.

He’s anti confrontational and never told me of any of these changes. We’ve heard rumors, but nothing set in stone. I only just found out because a coworker of mine was accidentally looped in with the manager’s email chain talking about the changes. 

Imo, I think the business is going under. He made a very idiotic decision for our sales team to offer 1 ad for 50% off and get another one free, essentially losing ad revenue with doing this deal. He figured this will draw business in but once that deal ended, we lost over half of the businesses that signed up for the deals. (Shocker right)?

What should I do? Should I hold on to this weekend position until I find another job?"
"Moved across the country for dream job, 30 days in and there are layoffs.","So let me start by apologizing, but I am typing this on mobile and there may be grammatical errors.

I really need some outside perspective on this, because I am currently in a situation that I can safely say I’ve never been in before.

Little background: I’m a college graduate with about 9 years of work experience under my belt; including publications with the government. But the field I’ve found myself in for my “career for life” is one in which I specialize in a very niche production/manufacturing method and oversee the regulations surrounding this particular process. 

Niche as in there’s right around 11 facilities in the US that even do this process, whereas it’s super popular in Europe. 

I spent a little over 4 years at one of these facilities (smallest one in the US and a startup), expanding my knowledge, learning everything I could, getting certified in all the right things, etc. Eventually I maxed out my potential (and hit a salary ceiling) with this company and felt it was the right time to spread my wings and get my foot in the door with a more established facility.

Enter my current place of business. 

Thankfully I am single and have no kids, so after I landed a job at the new company I simply packed up my car and moved. I love the state and I really enjoy the company.

The upper management was very black and white about the reason they were hiring new blood in this department: the company had been purchased by a huge multinational organization who was revamping what was and is currently a dysfunctional facility. They needed “fixers”, people knowledgable in this field who weren’t afraid to come in and wrestle my particular department (among others) back under control.

I can say after a month that I wasn’t far off in my expectations when I accepted the job. 

Here’s the issue: 

The company is now running more efficiently and corporate has determined they have more staff than necessary to run at the forecasted capacity for this year. Obviously marketing is busting their balls to bring in bigger contracts but it hasn’t happened yet. So management has decided layoffs will be necessary and has announced this to the staff. 

I’ve been told privately by my boss (manager over my department) that my position is protected but my coworker (we are both supervisors in the same department), who was hired 3 months before me, is constantly whispering and fear mongering to me about his concerns that regardless of what management says - we are on the block and the company is failing. He says he knows this cause he has seen it happen with other facilities he has worked at before.

The rational side of me says there is no way a plant that has been purchased by this massive company and just finished a million dollar investment project/remodel is going under and that my experience is valuable enough to spare me from the layoffs. Plus they would lose their 10k sign on bonus they just paid me. 

The paranoid side of me is of course convinced that I’m about to be jobless in a new city miles away from “home”. 

Extra random info: 

-I do have a bit of a cushion fund that would help me get home, my house is being rented back in my home state but I could crash with family for free while looking for work.

-My boss gave me a very positive 30 day review, and has made a point to have me sit down with his boss (director from corporate) and show him my current projects (he was happy with my progress) and my boss even introduced me to his boss’ boss, who was excited to have someone on board with my experience since it is so niche.

TLDR: relocated 12 hours away to a new city to work at a cool company with the explicit intent to help them overhaul a struggling department. 30 days in layoffs have been announced and now my coworker is convinced he and I are going to be caught up in the layoffs and/or the whole company is about to close down. I’ve never been fired or laid off before and am mildly paranoid about this possibility.

Am I just overthinking my coworkers fear mongering?"
"Made redundant after 2 weeks! The reason behind it it's so weird, is it just because I am that bad?!?","So, I got this job in an apparently nice company with a lot of e-commerce shops (they produce little things for kitchen/home essentials). They're stuff is doing very good on Amazon/Ebay. I applied for two position, specified that I do have skills and desire to be interview for a specific one (with much my previous job title) and I got the job after two interviews. I was really happy and started the next day. My manager was absolutely nice and started to show me my jobs, tasks etc. I never lied to them about my abilities or knowledge and I told them that I am a very quite person, but if I do not understand I ask for help/info. Few days later, the main manager goes to holiday. He booked a long time ago and left me with a lot of tasks to complete and a schedule to follow every day. As soon as I got there:

\-My desk was empty. Main pc was taken by someone else, I asked for clarification, still waiting an answer. Other manager ask me to get my personal laptop next day.

\-All my schedule is being changed by the other managers as they like and I am being tucked away to a department to help them due to absences and holidays booked by people. I do understand that I am the new person, so I just joined this department and helped them as the other managers kept asking me.

\-This department is a mess, people rely to their impression, they do not have any spreadsheets/formula/process. So, I was constantly confused by their own confusion. I started to take care of the most important things, get the warehouse to pack the orders in time. 

\-That led to the warehouse team deciding that I am their direct manager and complaining about everything, from the roof leaking and to the HR issues as holidays.

Finally, after 7 days, my direct manager come back and it's announcing that he is leaving soon. That leads to the HR people telling me that I am not good enough for them, I can't do his job (which is obviously , I did not apply for the managing position, but the assistant one!) so they need some person with a lot of experience behind and my role is going to be cut. When I asked if I did something so wrong to let me down that quickly, they replied that I am slow and I should known everybody jobs and process by now. I replied that I did not have any real guidance expect for the first few days, and I did repeatedly ask for more training from seniors and I did asked them that in this way I would do more harm than good. Well, HR started to say that I was not polite, that I did ask too many questions and to get the checks for the 2 weeks and leave.

I tried to not be upset, because I had a feeling last weekend that some sh\*tshow was going to hit me, but I tried to talk with the nice manager and he apologize for leaving me to the wolf and that he did not care about my situation because he is leaving. Which made him not that nice in the end.

So, Do I have to take this as sign that maybe I should not aspire to have technical job and settle for the normal admin stuff that I did for the last 4 years. I wanted this job to get the chance to improve my skills and maybe start a career in e-commerce. But maybe they are right, I am just dumb."
"Laid off with unused PTO, will I be paid for it?","Not sure if this is a r/finance question, or a r/jobs question...

Been with this company for 4 years. 3.5 years working in PA (main office) and the last half year in FL (same position). I was laid off a month ago for business reasons which I understand. I received my last paycheck which was for the normal amount I would have earned, but have about 126 hours of unused PTO. Should I have been paid for the unused PTO? It seems unfair that I was saving it for a planned vacation, which my boss knew about, and not get compensated. I know different states have rules regarding PTO, but which state would I fall under? Technically speaking, I earned the PTO in PA before I moved to FL. PA has to pay for PTO, but FL doesn't. Is this something I should push on, or am I SOL?

tl;dr 

1. Should I have been paid for the unused PTO?

2.  Which state laws would I fall under, PA or FL?"
My girlfriend was just fired over the phone from her job of store manager. She says she’s sure it was a mistake and her boss only gave a brief reason and referred her to HR.

Is there anything she can do? She had only worked there for 3 weeks but says she was getting feedback that was was doing exceptionally well. They had taken the time to fly her across the country for a week of training, she had hired several new employees etc. It was literally her dream job and she legit put in 110%. She was completely blindsided by this. She received no warning and the explanation given to her by her manager was extremely brief and she doesn’t understand. She *thinks what happened is that an employee edited THEIR OWN time stamps and that my gf unknowingly approved it. She’s not even sure if she had the *ability* to see employee edits. I asked around and managers where I work said they’re not sure how they would see such a thing and don’t thoroughly interrogate their employees on the days they aren’t in the store to see if they worked hours they said they would. She’s so confident that she did nothing wrong that she feels like she was “set up” or something even though she thinks her boss thought she was great. 

Is there anything she can/should do? Maybe at least get a fuller explanation so she can better understand what happened?"
How to discuss recent redundancy in job interviews and with Recruiters?,"27 year old male, working in sales in the SaaS industry.   Unfortunately my company just made me redundant before Christmas and my contract is due to end on the 15th January.  The reason for the redundancy is that the bigger organisation we are part of were not happy with how our entity was performing - therefore some people were let go, with the Sales department being the main target. 

In terms of job applications, I know the drill and just to focus on my strengths in my CV and Cover Letter - no need to mention the redundancy.   When it comes to the interviews however, and conversations with Recruiters, I could do with some casual guidance.

My plan is to just be like ''Yeah there was some restructuring going on due to the recent acquisition by the bigger organisation, and this restructuring included some job losses''....... and then to turn the conversation back into the new job which I'm applying for, how it excites me, and what I can bring to the table.

I would however appreciate some further pointers and advice from people who have been in this situation before, or who may have some good ideas."
Got notice that our team is getting laid off... My first time.. Need a little guidance.,"Found out our whole team is getting laid off starting Nov. Sales did not go as planned and they have to make the tough decisions. No hard feelings here. I get it. I am not in the ""Sales"" part of the team and was told I will be staying a little longer. I have a meeting sometime today to speak about my severance. 

The President of the company pulled me aside (away from HR) and told me ""You're good, not going anywhere""... Should I take his word for it? 

I am so confused. Also very certain this may have happened to someone else and was probably lied to. Should I play my cards and ask for more severance than they are offering? Ultimately, I will eventually get let go. It is just a matter of when."
I think my boss might fire me unfairly,"I’m a supervisor in a shop for context 

My manager called me in for a ‘little chat’ on Saturday and shouted at me for not living up to expectations (targets etc), and essentially said that I haven’t progressed to the standard which she would have expected by now and I don’t understand it. She hinted that she would be letting my go and I’m panicking. I always meet my targets, have never had any issues with customers or other staff members, etc. I leave the store tidy and the tills are always balanced. I don’t understand where this came from. I’m not sure if I should start looking for a new job. Any advice is welcome thanks."
My friend/coworker warned me that I might get fired and there was a complaint filed against me.,"I have been working at this company for almost 4 years now. We recently hired a COO and ever since he began, there has been a lot of company restructuring. Just yesterday a senior manager was fired out of the blue, as well as one of the IT guys.

My coworker and friend is an HR assistant for the company and told me today to be careful, as apparently there was a complaint filed against me. The odd thing is that this coworker who complained doesn't even work in my department - I've only ever dealt with her once. Apparently she went to the CEO of the company and told them that I am incompetent, I am unproductive and I provide no value to the company. My HR coworker told me she wanted me to be aware of this so that I am not left with any surprises. 

As far as I know, I get everything completed and do my job properly. There are some times when I have a lot on my plate and don't fulfill minor requests immediately and may take a few days or require a reminder, but this doesn't happen often. Other than that I have never made any major mistakes or have felt incompetent. I was told by my boss literally last month that if she felt I was not doing a good job, she would let me know. 

I'm just not sure if I should be doing anything about this information I have been provided? I've been going to work with the worry that tomorrow will be my last day. I'm not sure if I should bring up this knowledge to my boss, or just do nothing as I don't want to possibly throw my coworker under the bus? Should I just sit around and await my pending fate?"
Working for a company that started layoffs. Should I start looking?,"I [25 F] am working in IT for a pharmaceutical company.

I got fired for the first time in my life today 3 weeks into the position,"This was my first real job out of college. I graduated last summer and worked for my mom while applying to full-time jobs. I wasn’t having any luck until “Company X” hired me on the spot three weeks ago. I was so excited to finally be able to work a real job in my field of study. I interviewed with the President of the company and they made the job seem too good to be true (because it was) but I was sold, as I was desperate to start working. I quickly learned that the position was NOTHING like what I was told it would be. I was pretty much doing customer service for up to 10 hours a day. My coworkers barely spoke to me unless I made a mistake or they needed me to run errands for them outside the office like grab coffees. No matter how nice or accommodating I tried to be, all the managers treated and spoke to me like an outcast. No one even bothered to introduce themselves or ask who I was upon meeting. I was expected to know how to do everything right off the bat without any formal training and was practically scolded by my managers on a daily basis for making honest mistakes. Going to work everyday made me physically uncomfortable but I didn’t want to quit without having anything lined up and I also thought that maybe if i stuck it out a little longer, I could establish myself as a valuable member in the company. Wrong. One of the managers (not even my boss) called me this morning to inform me that “the team had a discussion and felt that  I was not a right fit.” Part of me is relieved that I don’t have to go back to such a toxic work environment but the other part of me feels completely helpless. It took me so long to find this position and now I wonder how long it will take to find the next. My goal was to be employed by the summertime and we’re approaching the end of April. For those who have been laid off, how did you cope? I know three weeks isn’t a long enough time to be invested in a company, but it still feels like a huge slap to the face. Also, how long did it take to get another job? Feeling discouraged :("
Just got laid off. Negotiating severance & job market at end of year,"I just got laid off, and the only silver lining is that they're willing to offer more than their standard severance, to 6 weeks (when the standard, according to them and the amount of time I was there, is 2 weeks).

&#x200B;

I'm still concerned, though, because this is the end of the year and I understand the job market is usually softer around this time (I've been in CPG digital marketing for a decade). The severance would only take me into mid December. (I have money saved up, but still)

&#x200B;

In this case, #1 what's a good way to go about negotiating severance? My performance record was good, and in all fairness politics is the biggest reason I got laid off.

&#x200B;

\#2 Is the job market really that much softer at the end of the year? I haven't applied for jobs at this time of year before.

Thanks!"
My coworker just got fired,"It was known that he was underperforming but, overall, he’s a pretty good guy. He also has kids to support. I was talking to him this morning. A couple hours later another coworker pings me to tell me he’s gone. I went to check his cube and there’s still a sandwich on his desk with papers everywhere...

We’re not friends outside of work or anything but he connected with me on LinkedIn pretty much immediately after he got fired. What do you say to someone after something like that? I’d like to send him a message on LinkedIn but I don’t exactly want to refer him for another job either. I guess I’m just a little creeped out by how quickly you can get blindsided by something like a layoff (on a Tuesday morning of all times) and I feel bad for him. "
Voluntary Termination,"Long story short, my corporate company has requested voluntary terminations twice this year and has had two hiring freezes.

The second one came today and I am worried if this might mean layoffs for my department which is Analytics. 

Wondering if I should read the writing on the wall and start applying for new employment...
Anyone have any experience with these? Offer some comforting words/advice?"
Saw my job posted on company’s career page. How should I proceed?,"Background: I’ve been employed in the company for a bit over 3 months.  I was previously laid off from my last job due to budget cuts, so the last thing I need is another one. 

Today, while browsing through my company’s career page, I noticed that my job was posted (I’m pretty sure it’s mine because I am solely responsible for one aspect of the job, which is included in the posting). The only difference is this one is a mid level while mine is entry. Also, my department is small and we have a small contract, so I doubt they will hire someone else; I am unaware of any of the staff leaving. 

It did take me a while to get use to the job, as I changed industries. I’m just starting to get the hang of it, but am still trying to figure things out, which, according to other colleagues, is fine. 

Also, I have not been given a formal warning about my performance. I haven’t even had my 90 day review. Should I worry? 

TLDR: found my job listed on company career page; worried I may be fired. Employed at company for a bit over 90 days."
"Company has had 2 rounds of layoffs in 3 months, company president has said no guarantees of more layoffs come 2020, am I reacting too soon in looking for a new job?","I’ve been with my current employer as an Implementation project manager since April 2019 and frankly, I love my job and my team that I work with. It’s the first job in over 3 years that I truly enjoy and have a great work/life balance. 

But we’ve recently started merging with our partner company (we’re under the same parent company and work with them pretty consistently) and we’ve seen a handful of execs leave for other job opportunities in the last 2 months.  I thought- good for them.

But recently the company has laid off about 30-35 people in the span of 3 months and our company is less than 2,000 employees so it worries a lot of us. 

Some of the folks they laid off have been senior/long-time employees, SMEs etc. so we were shocked to hear about some of the more senior folks being let go. 

I haven’t been here for a long time but I know my role in my department is vital (primarily customer-facing) so I know I am safe for the rest of 2019. 

During an all-company meeting, the president of our department did state that he has no guarantees about more “downsizing” come the new year. Which had a lot of my coworkers’ ears perked up and worrying even more. 

I’ve polished my resume & started looking at jobs on LinkedIn & Glassdoor. Am I wrong to be looking so early for a new role? If I do get contacted by a potential new employer, how do I explain why reason for wanting to leave my current employer?"

Job redundancy in Australia,"Hi everyone, I'm a new manager at my workplace and I've been working here for some time now. One of the many things I handle is managing the staff. Unfortunately, we're making some heavy losses at the moment and need to cut back on staff. One option we're looking at is making some lower paying jobs redundant. I've personally never done this before, and Google wasn't of much help. Can someone help explain to me how does one make a job redundant?"
Got let go from my “Temporary” job before going off to college. Didn’t know about it until I can back from a two-week vacation. They’ve lost my check and am unsure of how to respond since I won’t be here to collect it.,"I left out a lot of details that were not as important and this is still pretty long sorry about that but I just really want some good advice on handling this.

I got hired to work in an office as the two owners really needed help because they were understaffed. I told them that I would be willing to work until mid-August since I would be leaving to go to school, this was back in April. I made sure to mention early on that I wanted to take a two-week vacation in July, which was approved and worked up until the start of my vacation everything was fine.

Fast-forward to the end of my two-week vacation, I text my boss, owner 1, and say that I made it back okay and that I’m ready to continue working. 

He responds to me a day later stating,
”Hey man, hope your vacation went well. So here's an update on things we have hired two more employees, so we are covered with regular staff. Your last check is here which you can pick up during normal office hours. Also, we may need help here in the office on the weekends (busiest time of the week) and if that is the case we will reach out to you and check your availability.”

The thing about maybe needing extra help was basically fluff to make them seem like they weren’t putting me in rough spot by letting me go a month earlier than we had agreed on, but such is life, right?

I didn’t respond to this text because I was equal parts embarrassed and upset at the reality of my being let go. I was never given any indication that they didn't want me or that I was messing something up for them and the office. Also something about getting let go through text made me really upset and I find it somewhat demeaning. 

As well as not responding, I never went to pick up my check until yesterday. When I got there, the only person in the office was one of the new employees and despite his best efforts, had no luck finding my check. He texted the owner 2 and he told the new employee to tell me to come back tomorrow in the afternoon to pick up my check.

Which bring me to today. As I was about to leave my house to go to the office again I got a text from the owner 2 saying,
”I looked for your check in the office but owner 1 placed it somewhere and I couldn't find it. He's on vacation until next week but I'll try to get ahold of him again to double-check on where it is. Thanks and sorry about that.”

Honestly, along with being taken aback by the what happened with my previous employer, I'm left not knowing how to respond to any of this as it's the first time I have been fired/let go/laid off (whichever is most appropriate) and I have has other jobs before this one. 

I would really appreciate any and all advice on how to deal with this. 

Thanks again."
I know I’m being laid off. I don’t know when.,"This is a little complicated, but I’m very new to the workforce and run the development department for a mid-size nonprofit. I have 9 months of experience in this space with the rest of my resume filled with internships. I also don’t have a bachelors degree. 

Last week it was decided that our organization would merge with a larger nonprofit in the city for financial reasons. This nonprofit is backed by a bank, so they have no need for a fundraising arm. My job is the only one being eliminated and I’ve been ordered to stop working entirely. 

It’s going to take me a while to find something. I have less than a year of experience, but it’s all leadership so I keep getting bounced from entry level and also bounced from mid-level leadership roles.

I am supposedly going to get two months severance, but I don’t know when it will start. Which means i can’t apply for jobs and I know I won’t find something quickly. I only know my last day will be sometime between next week and February. 

Any advice for how I can proceed in this situation? They’ve got me twisting in the wind and I don’t know how to move forward."
Any advice for my father (60M) that recently got laid off from his factory job after 25 years?,"My dad just recently lost his job that he’s been working at for the past 25 years. He did metal working in a steel plant that has now gone bankrupt. 

He’s asking for advice on what he should do next. He doesn’t have skills really. Has poor computer literacy. No degree or education past high school. He feels like he’s too old to go to school for it to be worth anything. 

He ultimately doesn’t think that he would completely retire, he has too much energy to sit around the house. 

I’m not sure what to tell him or what advice to give."
Should I call out my managers during a group meeting?,"So I'm back at my old job that I had for 2 years and came back after 2 years. I'm only here until I hear back from my uncle which will take a couple or months. I've been here for about a month now and they laid off/ fired 5 of them since I came back. It's a retail (non profit) job and we only have 10 people working the store (as of now)  All my coworkers are freaking out that they will be the next to go. 

I'm thinking calling them out in the group meeting next week. I might say this ""I don't feel comfortable working here if you're going to let someone go everyweek...etc""
This place is a shithole and people are afraid to speak out. I'm not  trying to vent I just need a 3rd party on this.

"I been working at a fast food restaurant for 7 months and we recently got a new manager and I feel like my job is in jeopardy, what should I do?","I been working at a fast food restaurant for 7 months or so and my previous general manager resigned and she was my favorite manager I ever had, she offered my an assistant manager position after only working there for a couple months. I declined because I didn’t want the responsibility. 

I always felt that my job was secured because of her, we had such a great relationship, when she resigned we got a new manager and after he started working there 2 of my coworkers quit and 2 assistant managers left.

He is a cool person when everything is going fine but he can flip his attitude quick. He takes things very personal instead of keeping things professional. I honestly feel like he has a personal bias. Since I got hired I been doing delivery every Monday and Thursday, but he removed me from that position because I don’t know why because I am a very good organizer but I felt I was a little too slow for him, he would always come in the freezer and tell me “are you almost?” Or “hurry up so I can send you on your break”

It’s not my fault because I’m literally doing a 2 person job, when my previous manager was there she would have me and a coworker do the delivery at the same time because it’s usually a very big delivery. I honestly felt overwhelmed/overworked but I didn’t mind it because I need the job/hours

A couple weeks ago he hired 2 employees and gave the new guy the delivery position, and my old schedule.

So now I close from 5-10:30pm almost everyday of the week which I can’t complain because I need the hours.

Today he hired 2 more employees and I feel like whats the point if we already have enough employees?

I honestly feel my job is at risk, I am a very good worker and honestly try to do my job as best as I can. I been wanting to have a talk with him because I don’t feel secure anymore, the only thing that makes me feel better is applying for a new job. 

What should I do?

And if I do get fired, how do I apply for unemployment? And how does employment effect my future?"

Getting Laid Off Soon! In Need of Career Advice!,"Hi Reddit, I'll try to keep this short, but my buddy and I are looking for career advice, so I'll give you our situation and the options we are faced with. We've been at the company for about 6+ months, and we were told last month our branch will be closing next summer. I'm a fresh grad with 6+ months experience in the field, and my friend is a grad with way more years in the field. We were given 3 months pay severance packages, but told to stay until the layoff around early summer 2020, so neither of us should have trouble finding a new job, but when do we make our move? What's better, collect severance and keeping working, then find a new job when the field in more saturated or start looking now when the field is less saturated and rely on steady paycheck rather than a lump sum later?

**Variables of the situation:**

Our branch is closing when our local university graduates it's students resulting in my job applicants within our field during this time.

After our closure, we get a couple months pay, a bonus, along with a job hunt/outplacement service, but we have to stay with the dying company until it's closure.

We are currently in a season where the field is too heavy with new applicants, prompting us to look for jobs now, rather than wait.

How do I make recruiters stop talking to me?,"I am training to be a call center agent but decided to just get a free English training because my Trainer is toxic, so when I end my training at 2:00 pm I keep getting 'persuade' by these recruiters to try to get me recruited to their company and they heard me speak English fluently, proficient and precise and immediately started to pay attentive to me and started trying to convince me than try to talk to do that to my classmates, which they ignored by the way (I noticed they only talk to people who spoke English as they leave making my escape easy). They're always outside 5 meters away from the building I was training.

All I need is a sentence to make them stop talking without saying no or getting their phone number when the company I am training at already wants me and has to train me to get better at what I can do as a person who took the opportunity to train or try to learn English more fluently."
Weird layoff situation that kinda bugs me. Thoughts?,"Hey guys, I had a weird situation at work that I wanted to talk about and get your thoughts about?

We suffered some layoffs and I was on the list for the positions eliminated, however, it appears I was on the list because I could be moved to another department pretty easily, thus saving my job, or rather, allowing multiple people to keep their jobs, including me. It wasn't about performance or anything, my manager said as much and I've performed very well over the years. I'm definitely wanted here. Me moving meant other people got to keep their jobs, and me too. 

My question is, I still feel weird about it, because I was technically on the list, but they didn't want me to be obviously and didn't want to lose me, so how am I supposed to feel about that? Like, it's like, I am relieved, and I'm not laid off like others, but I still feel like I got the dice rolled and it wasn't in my favor. They definitely tried to keep as many people as they could, save as much as they could and move them to other depts and my new manager is very happy to have me, and asked for me to join him. 

I feel kinda weird about it, relieved, and still kinda, like I was targeted for some unknown reason. Maybe it's just the situation is always rough with layoffs on why I feel this way? Any advice or thoughts you have that could possibly help ease my mind a little? Hard to see when you are experiencing things like this and the people you care about at work are too.

My mom unexpectedly lost her job today. My brother and I are in college. What can/should I do?,My mom's job was in the legal field working for an insurance company. She made $125k/year and her job paid most of my family's expenses. Now my parents' household income is my dad's $75k per year job. I'm currently a junior in college and my brother just started college a couple weeks ago. I have no idea what I should do or what I can do to help her/my family. Has anyone been in a situation like this or know what I can do to help?
What should I say about me being laid off?,"So I was laid off from a job a month ago. I was there for about a year. It wasn’t the right fit so I was somewhat relieved. I’m feeling self-conscious about potentially having to explain that I was the only one that was laid off in a small team. We didn’t part on bad terms but I’m not 100% my direct manager will sing me praises either. 

I had sent out some resumes prior to being laid off and now just starting to get callbacks for interviews. 

Wanted to ask what I should disclose? I’m sure I will get asked “why are you looking for a job?” Should I disclose that I was laid off (technically was still employed when I sent out the resume) or spin it so that it focuses on why the potential new job is the better fit? Technically they are not asking if I’m still employed. I don’t want to lie but I also want to be mindful about what I am obligated to disclose at this stage of the recruiting process. 

I asked my previous employer (a big corporation) about what they will disclose to my future employer in terms of reason for me no longer employed, they said they can only confirm employment dates and salary. Actually there is a toll free number that they provide to do that. 

Thoughts?"
Terrified by a massive layoff at work,"I went on a three weeks vacation and returned to work on Monday only to find out that layoffs was going on. Some of my colleagues around me were receiving calls from HR and many were just whispering up and down.

28 people have gone in 2 days. Management just told us that the remaining people are safe.

I am very terrified. I have been working on starting my business but yet at the stage of leaving my job to face the business squarely as I am gradually using my salary to grow my business.

I have been shaking since Monday.
How has any of you managed layoff at work."
Position eliminated after working for company for one month,"I started working for a company in Texas back in September only to be told on Friday that my position was eliminated after being out for 5 days with a very serious illness.

Anyone have any other advice?"
Out of work after 14 years,"Hi all:

I’m sure mine isn’t the first or last post of its type.  Regardless...

After working at my company for 14 years in IT, I was informed that my (along with many other positions) were eliminated and I was let go as part of a workforce reduction.  I didn’t do anything wrong and I was told I’d be leaving in good standing.  My immediate boss also offered to write a letter of recommendation for me.

I’m getting almost 5 months of severance pay and the company is offering a professional placement/recruitment service to us who were let go for no charge for 6 months.

I know people make it through this all the time.  I know this often leads to bigger and better things for people and it really was time for a change at work.  I was stuck at my old job.  And I do have leads and heard back from one company already that my resume was moving up the chain

The fact is though, this is scary as hell.  We all play out worst case scenarios in our heads in these situations.

Anyone here been through this?  What are some tips and tricks to cope aside from the painfully obvious?"
What does a employment termination conversation sound like? Someone at work got fired and it went over really quick,"I’m genuinely curious what it’s like to fire someone.

My coordinator was let go and management has pretty much insinuated that I am not to reach out to her. I want to help and let her know I'd be a reference.,"Should I disregard what management said and reach out to her but just request that she keep it between us? Or should I play it safe and just keep my distance?

She and I had a great working relationship, but budget cuts came to play when it came to her role so I was told she would need to be let go. Wasn't my decision at all, but I had to roll with the punches.

Just need a little guidance on how I should handle this."
I was laid off by a company actively committing fraud. Should I pull the trigger?,"A little background: I worked for a company who’s marketing department consisted of just me and a marketing director. In the short time I was there the marketing director proudly showed me that she was able to bring in extra funds by forging documents to send to vendors. You see, various vendors would work with us to create marketing campaigns and would reimburse us in full at the end. She discovered that if she created fake invoices (from REAL companies!) that she could get reimbursed, plus reel in a couple extra thousand. I immediately questioned the ethics of this approach to which she assured me “everyone does it. It’s implied.”

The marketing director soured on me seemingly overnight and picked apart my work until it was enough to make a case to have the owners fire me.

I’m in a position where I could report them to the vendors and sink that ship. I’m imagining a scenario where I could then tell recruiters I was let go because of my ethical stance, instead of “performance issues.” On the other hand, whistleblowers are never viewed in a positive light and the company would absolutely know it was me that narc’d, including some good friends and strong references still at the company.  "
Can a Company Lay You Off Then Take It Back?,"In April our department was told that our jobs were moving to one of our overseas departments in a phased approach. I was one of the people that was going to be in the first phase of layoffs, others were told they would be after my group, etc. I was given a paper that day that said in August my employment would be terminated, and details about severance would be given at that time.

Over the following months many in my department decided not to wait to be terminated and found jobs either inside or out of the company. (I tried too, but to no avail as of yet). Also, to nobody’s surprise, the overseas team that is supposed to be taking over isn’t able to perform at the level they need to. 

Last week I get pulled into a meeting with some others that were slated to be let go in August where they tell us they would like to have a few of us fill some positions they need filled over the busy season, effectively making it an extension until February. This was presented as an *option* to extend, not mandatory. 

On Monday I email my manager and my director my decision to not extend. I don’t feel like it’s my responsibility to cover their poor decision, and I also have another job that is offering to give me more hours. I get a response back saying that I we should have a call, and on the call my director says that he already told HR that we all wanted to extend. I told him that I didn’t want to and that he should retract that.

Later that day we speak again and he tells me that last week they presented the extension incorrectly, and that we were being extended regardless. The option to leave with severance is no longer an option according to him. I voiced my displeasure, asked if I do find something within the company could I take it, etc, but in no way did I communicate that I was grateful to be extended. 

Here’s my question: this whole this seems a little shady. The extension was presented by two people as being optional, and once I decided to exercise the option to *not* extended, the option to leave gets taken away from me. Can they actually do that? What advice do you have? 

I’m in the US, Minnesota if that helps."
"If I get salary continuation as apart of layoffs, am I technically still ‘employed’ when applying to other jobs","Layoffs are coming, and I’m looking into my situation.  Instead of severance, my employer offers a salary continuation plan where I receive a regular paycheck and benefits for a period.  Legally, if I take another job, the salary/benefits cease.

My question is if I’m laid off, can I present myself as employed to potential employers?  Obviously, being employed is more attractive to potential employers and gives me more leverage for salary negotiations.  It feels like salary continuation is basically a long paid vacation to my mind.  And the fact that I can’t collect unemployment under this arrangement also leads me to believe that I’m ‘employed’ in some sense.

Not sure how the background/employment verification process works with these situations..."
can I ask to get laid off? help please!,"So I recently had a normal weekly meeting with my boss. She was showering me with praise during this meeting, saying they are ""so impressed"" with my work, and how how I've been ""instrumental"" to the changes taken place in the department. Then, at the end of the meeting, my boss told me ""by the way, this isn't because of your performance, but we are cutting your hours down to 10-15 hours per week because since hiring a new person in the department, we don't have the money in the budget for your hours."" I think this is a classic case of choosing to hire a new person for crap pay, and try and phase out the seasoned workers who you have to keep giving raises to. Obviously it pissed me off but I try to understand it's not personal and it happens to people all the time. I'm looking for jobs and furiously applying.

The real problem is that I live over 60 miles from the office, and regularly work from home for part of each week, but now my boss is saying my ""new schedule"" will consist of two 6 hour days in-office. I already told my boss at our meeting look, that doesn't work for me, I cannot afford to spend 1/2 my earnings in gas to get there and back. But they're apparently taking away working from home as a privilege (even though I did nothing wrong.)

I'm going to have a frank discussion with my boss this afternoon and explain my dissatisfaction with this arrangement, and also, I really want to ask to just be laid off. The meager pay I'll be receiving for roughly 12 hours of work per week, barely makes it worth it for me to drive over an hour each way to the office. I think they have decided to drop my hours instead of lay me off, because there's still some projects I'm working on for them and they want to get every last drop of work out of me rather than just let me go now. They have to  know that for any adult human being who owns a home, 12 hours of work per week factoring in the distance I travel, is not a sustainable income. 

I wanted to hopefully get some opinions and find out if ""asking"" to be laid off is even remotely a possible thing to do. I am thinking of putting it to be boss this way, saying: ""look, I know there probably was some discussion behind the scenes about if it would be possible to keep me onboard or if I would have to be let go. I'm guessing the choice to keep me on for 10-15 hours a week is the max that was allowed in the budget. For me personally, as I explained, this is hardly sustainable even during the process of searching for new employment. I want to find out if a lay off was ever in the cards and if that could be a possibility instead of the decrease in hours.""

I'm afraid she's going to take that as me quitting, which is obviously not what I want because it ruins my chances of collecting unemployment. And I also fear that if I truly were to get laid off, it would make it a lot harder for me to find a job (being unemployed). I need advice please!"

I plan to take a couple days, and then try to get back on my feet but I am really in need of some advice or even similar personal experiences and how you got out of it. I feel slightly depressed and defeated right now. I only have about 15K saved up. I am 27 years old. Can someone please talk me through this..."
My organization has just laid off 3 colleagues in really bad fashion and it’s making me nervous and considering starting to look elsewhere.,"My org recently got rid of a few director level people. I’m vying for a senior position and seeing how these directors got treated makes me think it’s a thankless job that is short lived. The way they got rid of them was poor too, they hired other people from outside into a role that is kind of similar, then told all the existing ones their jobs aren’t required, took their computers and access cards and walked them out of the building.

On the side I have already been approached by various other places but have declined because the org I’m in now pays a lot higher than anyone else. I’m basically earning 20-30% more than colleagues in other organizations. But is that enough? For the peace of mind and stability I’m thinking of just taking a 20-30% pay cut into a place that treats their people better.

Anyone else seen this type of behavior? Is it poor culture or just normal practice these days?"

Also on mobile so excuse any errors. I currently work at a tire house in VA. Friday afternoon, a letter was posted saying all employees are required to be present for a training day on sunday. This is the one day of the week we are never scheduled to work. We all fall under full time work so I'm not sure how this works. Many of us, including me said we wouldn't be coming in, but were told it's mandatory. At the end of the letter it said ""there are no exceptions to missing this training"". Is it legal to require employees to be at work on a non scheduled day with so little advance warning? We are under the assumption this it to discipline/terminate anyone who doesn't show up. Do I have a case with the labor board if there is a mass firing? Any advice in this case would be appreciated."
Did I just get fired or laid off?,"At the end of my shift I was the last person to leave the store. I noticed that my boss had privately talked to everyone at the store throughout the day but that I was never talked to. I joined a store that just opened on the 3rd. As I was leaving my boss comes up to me and asks to talk. I did not think anything of it even though there were days I was asked to leave early and told not come in on other days. I was not expecting what he was about to tell me. He said that his labor was too high and that there just wasnt enough sales. He looked exhausted. He told me not to come in anymore because he has too many people. He shook my hand about four times and said that he liked me. When I got hired, they specifically told me that they needed people for night time front of the house. This came a day after he posted everyone's schedule. After I had been coming in everyday on their time without having anything to go off of. Im wondering If this would be considered being laid off? Can I tell people that I work for this company still?"
I left work on Friday expecting to be fired. But it’s Sunday evening and I’m expecting to go to work tomorrow. I need some advice.,"So I recently started working at this sales/fundraising company in the last couple weeks. The job isn’t the worst, I sit around and raise money for high school athletic departments across the country, but it’s a lot of calling and emailing and tedious work. 

In the middle of the office, there is a computer that has a huge excel sheet up with everyone’s numbers from the month and it is controlled by hq in a different state, so we can only look at it. However, I noticed a trend that throughout certain days, people that were not meeting numbers had an asterisk* appear next to there name, and the next day they did not show up for work, so I assumed they were fired. 

I have been working hard the last week but haven’t made a sale recently, and on Friday I saw the ill fated asterisk appear next to my name. I wasn’t surprised since it had been a tough week and so I left work on Friday fully expecting to receive a call from HR with the news of termination. However, I haven’t received any news over the weekend so I’m prepared to go to work tomorrow as if all is normal. 

I’m not fully sure what to do. Would be very uncomfortable if I shows up tomorrow and they had given my desk to someone else or weren’t expecting me to come in. Does anyone have any advice?"
The state of the labor market - Have any of you been laid off or had your company close?,"I see a lot of people that I know across the country being laid off or having companies close down. I'm just curious on your experiences since we keep hearing about an upcoming recession. Has it seemed worse recently than normal (less postings, less call backs or interviews, less offers), or does it feel the same?"
Does this count as being fired?,"So a little context. I graduated with an art degree, but finding an art job and freelance is hard so I took up a part time job at an food related job. This job is at will so of course I can be let go at anytime. Basically long story short the boss emails me telling me not to come back and I got a little paper saying I’m discharged in said attachment. I guess I didn’t perform well, but she said I was doing fine last week in person a little confusing but whatever besides the point. My question is how this will impact me for future jobs if this counts as being fired.

This isn’t even a job in my career field, it was just to make money so I would hate for it to hinder my chances at getting an art job. I really did give this job my all as I do every job I just wasn’t super fast due to an ankle injury. Will this job forever be burned on my history when applying to future jobs related to my files? :( I’m really stressed about how it will impact me. I did do anything offensive or terrible I just wasn’t a good fit I guess? Boss lady didn’t explain why at all just said I’m not a good fit don’t come back."
Might get laid off and not sure how to feel or handle potential interviews,"I have been working at a great company for about 2 months now and have received a notice that I will be laid off if I do not improve in 2 weeks. I am currently working full time at a company completely unrelated to my major (Geologic engineering company team assistant as a marketing major) which can be very challenging at times even though I am learning a LOT. As I am doing my best, I am preparing for the worst case scenario by applying to other jobs right now. 

A little background to this situation, long story short: my trainer left 2 weeks for school right after my employment, the engineer I assist for was on vacation for 2 early weeks out of the 5 when I started there, and really strict project manager that doesn't like me asking repeat questions even though there's similar ones where I would like more of a confirmation (emails, scheduling, data,  etc.) than to repeat myself since I need to be careful with the data I handle. I take notes, organize dates, keep track of projects, and information using excel and a calendar. My supervisor is going to have a short daily meeting each morning for these 2 weeks to help me improve but I'm starting to think even if I improve, I don't know if I want to keep this position anymore and just use this as a stepping stone if possible to find a different job more in my field.

I did notice this would become difficult early on since I am unfamiliar with so much material but I was in the job search process right out of college (200+ apps & 15 interviews until I landed this job) which I chose to take what I could get offered. This job is flexible, quiet, offers benefits, and safe. However, I'm starting to feel stressed from all this scheduling, emailing, sitting, and information juggling (which might be just a regular job routine)

What are some things I could say for future interviews if this short time of employment is brought up? Is 2-3 months a good amount of time to say it wasn't the right fit for my career goals? Even if I give it my best effort but still get laid off, is it a bad thing? I always heard of people getting jobs outside their field of study but do many actually stick around for long?"
Two week leave- just started work.,I just was hired last weekend and now I have to take two weeks off of work because I can't leave from Indiana for those two weeks to take over two hours to get to work. Can my job fire me?
Fired from corporate job after 3 months without warning or reason. Was unemployed for 6mo prior. Where to go from here?,"I left the restaurant industry in late 2018 due to the effect it was having on my body and the long hours. Was able to collect unemployment and found work for a corporate restaurant chain after about 6 months. I worked there for 3 months with great performance reviews from my trainers through out. 

Then this week I get an urgent call from my senior asking if I can rearrange my schedule ( work in the field and make our own schedule) to come in to the office for a meeting. 

At the meeting my senior isn't there but the 2 heads of operations there and just say ""it's not working out, here's your final check"" etc

I ask why and they cannot give me a solid reason out side of not a good fit. 

My exit interview form says ""discharged"" not ""laid off"" but does not list a reason. As this was my introductory period and an at-will non contract position I understand they have this right. 

Now I do not wish put this short 3mo job on my resume, especially since it ended in getting ""discharged.""

I'm thinking of enrolling in a certificate course at my local university so it at least seems like I'm doing something with my life currently. 

I also have a 1099 gig on the side that can help fill my employment gap but it's still well over 6mo with nothing listed. 

What should I do from here with my resume and applications? How would you handle yourself in this situation?

I have about 5k saved up from this job. Luckily didn't touch my paychecks outside of bills. Maybe a 3month emergency fund."
Why aren't two-weeks notices a thing when firing someone?,Title
Better lay her off before she has babies...,"My boss just informed me that they can “no longer afford to pay me full time, therefore, they’re outsourcing my position”.  Whatever. I get it, being a boss for a small start up company is difficult and you have to cut corners when you don’t necessarily want to. I was their longest, most stable employee...but I digress. 

What really pisses me off is that they said to my coworker “well...it wasn’t an easy decision, but it’s for the best. Plus she was probably going to start having a family soon so...”. 

I’m quite sure it’s illegal to lay someone off because you assume they’re going to be starting a family soon. What would you do? 

I’m in the U.S. btw. "
Laid off in current job before second round of interviews for a job I applied for. What to do/say? Help Reddit!,"Ive been looking for another job. I just recently made it to the second round of interviews for a job I am really interested in. Today I was laid off, my position was eliminated. To make things worse I was the only one laid off. My next interview is Wednesday. How do I let the prospective employers know? What should I do. Anybody HR folks out there have any tips? For context I am a Software Project Manager. Would sincerely appreciate any advice."
Why did you get fired and how can you help others learn from your mistake?,"Getting let go from a job is hands down one of the most disappointing experiences I have gone through in my lifetime. I constantly have “if only” thoughts, and find myself regretting the actions I made that resulted in my unemployment. 

I was let go of my dream job after 2 years because I lacked responsibility and stopped showing up to work on time because I got too comfortable and lazy and ignored the possible consequences. What is something that got you fired that you hope others don’t do so they don’t make the same mistake?"
Question/Possible advice on getting fired.,"Let me first state that this is not my own concern, but the concerns of a dear friend who I would like to help. I am still struggling to find work.

Anyways to make a long story short (and to protect their identify), I had a friend who worked in food service at a somewhat large company. A minimum wage job and an at-will employment. My friend was fired just a few days ago. From my understanding... being at-will gives the employer the right to fire with or without reason/cause, with or without warning (or the time before getting fired), and with or without notice. I would like to talk about the ""with or without notice"" part.

I understand the first two parts (firing for any or no reason at all and at any given time)... but could the employer fire you while not even bothering to tell you? It got to the point where... 1) my friend was actually fired a little over week ago, 2) still worked five days, 3) the managers/supervisors were confused until they asked the higher ups, and then 4) suddenly they asked for my friends uniform because they fired her a week ago. Is this ethical? It can't be. What should my friend do?"
Company going bankrupt have 4 days till I'm unemployed what do I do?,"I just found out that I have four days until my work closes its doors. I l've been with them for eight years I've worked hard and finally got a position in the office doing data entry, running databases, and modeling in cad.

Just got laidoff from a pretty shit job. Should i even be sad?,"I can't help but feel like i should be because of the amount of effort i put into whatever was needed to do, which was just retail and stocking and restocking shelves and stuff. I was only laidoff because i didnt have reliable transportation and i missed too many days i guess. I plan on buying a car this coming week and i also have another interview scheduled for Tuesday that i have a family member working at. I'll also be able to earn ny CNA license there while being paid for the classes. But there's no guarantee that I'll get it though. I dunno."
"Non-Performance related Lay-off, followed by a below average performance review...","A month ago I was laid off from my job. We were specifically told it was not performance related. Fast forward to this week, all four of us from my department that were laid off received below average performance reviews. We each noticed the document had been completed two weeks after our layoff. On said review, one of the two challenges I needed to work on through the end of the year was a job specific skill (Feedback below).

We’re given an option to apply for internal jobs, but I’m not sure I want to continue to work for a company that uses the bell curve system to lay people off... Maybe my emotional layoff rollercoaster crashed, but is this common? Would you continue to work for the company?

"Put on performance improvement plan, did EVERYTHING outlined but was still fired.","Have never been in trouble at any job, however had a big dissagreement with a superior and all.of the sudden I magically was put on a performance improvement plan. I was told my customers did not like me (I am a district manager and oversee 30 stores inside automobile dealerships) I was told i could get training if needed. So knowing what was going on I dived into my job like never before, i even made a form for my customers to sign if they were completely satisfied at the end of my visits (Every last one signed it). I asked for training a couple times to help me learn whatever it was they said I wasnt doing, and they never came to the table to do it. The day of my ""re evaluation"" came and passed and I was happy at first then worried. I texted my immediate supervisor to see  how i was doing and what was going on with the re evaluation and he said let me check, they called me at 5 on a that same day and let me go. Do I have any recourse? Sorry for the long winded story."
"Was terminated for ""disruption to workplace"" and need help with what to put on applications","Long story short, I got terminated from a veterinary hospital for getting into a fight with a doctor. The doctor had held me and 3 others 2 hours past closing time because they felt the need to help this client that the know. I had told the doctor that the system was closed multiple times so that we could leave and she insisted on getting back into our system and helping anyways. I got upset and lost my temper slammed my hand on a work table and yelled at the doctor after she was done helping the client and she contacted HR. Even though I had the 3 nurses who were also held back defending me, HR took the doctor side and terminated me. This was my first time ever having problems there in the 3 1/2 years that I worked there. 

&#x200B;

I have a new job lined up, but I don't know what to put as the reason for termination. I want to be honest of course but i'm afraid that they may see that as a reason to not hire me. Its been 3 months since losing my job and clients still come in and ask for me.

Fired For Being Hospitalized?,"Hello r/jobs

&#x200B;

I worked at this job (\~100 employees) in Florida for 1.5 years. I was a fantastic employee and optimized the department I worked for. I was hospitalized the Friday before last and contacted my boss from the hospital letting him know I'll be in the hospital until Monday-Tuesday. Tuesday night I was released and I texted him letting him know that I'll be in tomorrow. Two hours later he thanked me for my service to the company, but ""it's time to move on"". I texted him back asking if it's legal for firing me for being in the hospital and I called him out for allowing other employees to ""no call no show"" for days in a row. The next day, he said he feels sorry for ending it via text and that he and the CEO would like to get coffee next week. Tomorrow I'll be having coffee with them. I haven't been able to get in contact with an employment lawyer to figure out if they fired me legally. 

&#x200B;

I was underpaid the entire year and a half I worked there (40% less than industry std), so I could really use some money. I have considered threatening to sue, but because I haven't confirmed that this practice is illegal- I'm not sure what to do. I know of some dirt that the business has been up to and I've considered threatening to report that as well. I've also considered offering to do some consulting work for them on the side because I know what they need. 

&#x200B;

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
Laid off yesterday morning due to workforce reductions. Help??,"So I got laid off from my first office job yesterday morning. Well, I went to lunch and they called me up as soon as I got back.  I only started there in early October, after seven months of trying to get an office job post graduation. 

I’m supposed to move into an apartment in a week. Already signed the lease. 

This is part rant part me panicking because I don’t know what to do. Got an interview at a temp agency later today, but honestly nothing they’ve got listed is anything I’m qualified for at all. I’m just. Super super panicked right now. I don’t have to be, once I get this apartment situation fixed and hopefully out of this lease then maybe it’ll be better.  

It’s just. I thought I’d gotten out of retail for good (I have an awful back and retail messes with it badly) and my health was improving and now I just. I don’t know what I’m going to do. 

How DOES one get an office job quickly??"
"Company has a habit of laying off people without any warning and expecting it to not have an effect on morale, anyone else been in a similar workplace?","I’m in a company that has had a reputation for laying off people without much warning, Senior people and junior, whilst also claiming to have commitment towards growing the business and to the success of the team. Is this just a corporate line? How do you reconcile against the behaviour you see versus the words that are spoken?"
Boss fired me unexpectedly through email,"Hey guys,

So I worked as a part-time receptionist for a spa for a few months. During the hiring process, I had told the owner that I had a back surgery approaching and need a month off, therefore to please consider that when choosing to hire me. She did, and right off the bat I could tell that she had little to no experience owning a business (puts her personal stress on workers, hires and fires, unprofessional, goes on constant vacations etc.) however, I had no issues as she was rarely in the building. She wished me good luck before I left for surgery and came back exactly a month later.

I worked all of  June 35hrs/wk and was off in May for surgery. I was off last weekend for a mini vacation that was approved before. During my vacation, I had gotten an email that I was terminated for not making enough sales in May and June. Ruined my weekend to say the least, I loved my job and loved my coworkers. 

I am not quite sure about the reasoning, I was off in May and not a single person made enough sales in June. We hardly have enough clients to make payroll, as many of our massage therapists quit due to owner's unprofessional-ism. She has a bad reputation with our local massage school so can't get any new therapists in. I tried my best to sell products and memberships all while leaving notes on the accounts like ""offered but declined membership."" I never had any arguments or bad relations with anyone, and always voiced concerns face-to-face.   


The choice to fire me is okay, as state law suggests I am an at-will employee, I have no hard feelings. My main question is, is firing through email normal? During a vacation lol? And how can I warn future employees about the workplace experience?"
Laid off or fired?,"A few years ago I worked for a Kumon tutoring center for my first job. My ninth or so month there (during the summer), my boss told me that since the place wasn't as busy at the time, I wouldn't have to come into my work days until later. After that month, she told me that the place wasn't busy enough to really need me, so I didn't have to come in unless she emailed me. Summer ended, school started again, and she never emailed me.

Would this be considered me getting laid off or fired (or something else)? Looking back on it I should have paid attention to see whether or not the place was really less busy than before, but I didn't, so I have no idea. I'm asking now because I'm applying for a new job and it's asking about previous employment."
I might be laid off... and it’s frustrating and depressing.,"I just learned today that they are considering if they want to keep me or let me go, although the boss says it is not my own fault as it was simply because they realised they were not ready to hire me. They said I did well for them however they were too small at this time to need my position. This is my fourth job.

Now I feel lost and distraught. I have a lot of plans for the upcoming month, and I was freshly hired (a month or so) and now I have to deal with no job stability. Due to circumstances where I had to switch jobs (three jobs for this year alone, including the current one), I am anxious with my employability. I feel lost and desperate as before I had this job I experienced tons of rejections. I also had mental health issues last year that made me quit my first job, while an abusive boss and the distance of work made me quit my second. The third job was a temporary form of informal work. I loved this job. I loved what I’m doing. I loved my pay. I loved how I was able to contribute to them. And now I feel stuck. My parents rely on me. And I just feel depressed to say I have to deal with the dilemma of finding a job again.

My boss says he will vouch me to his friend if ever they decide to lay me off to who I applied for in the past (but got my job offer too late) or to other companies. He then says he can give me recommendation letters to ensure I can have a smooth transition to another job without a period of joblessness. However, I’m still anxious.

Also he says that he thinks I’d work best for a FMCG company based on my marketing strategy. However getting a job there is extremely hard but how do I convince companies like them to consider me under their marketing department? 

I’ll also start applying again for jobs tonight if ever the boss lays me off.

But then I am stuck. I have zero plans for this. My parents rely on me and I don’t want to get to the downward spiral of depression due to me being jobless. 

I just feel I need support and need advice with regards to finding a job as soon as possible within an industry that I love (marketing)"
Anyone ever been let go in a group?,"I worked for a small company and not long after I accepted my position I realized that we had a TON of employee turnover and the company had numerous financial issues. I continued to look for positions but before I found a new one I was one of 3 people (approx 20%) of our workforce who was let go, as a group. No private meetings or discussions. Our senior project manager was largely MIA throughout the holidays and then announced he would not be returning for at least 3 mos if at all. This meant that outstanding projects were not being completed and could not be collected on so no income was coming in. After 10 days they let the three of us go. I was astounded about the manner of them doing it en masse. Has this happened to anyone else? Outright bizarre. Needless to say, there was no severance or anything. I had only been there about 2 1/2 months so I have basically no money after rent and some bills but I'm not eligible for unemployment because I wasn't in the position for a whole quarter. I am interviewing but nothing yet and trying to get a local job in a restaurant or shop to hep has been a no go as people think I'm overqualified or (bartender) underqualified. What to do? I still have to eat and commute to interviews and pay keep the phone, lights and internet on the rest of the month...

How much idleness would you tolerate before start searching for another job?,"In my 20 years experience, whenever I feel under-utilized I became worried and usually started looking for a new job. It happened three times already when I practically didn't do anything for 3 months or more. I think I'm in the same situation now. I haven't done anything significant/meaningful in almost 6 months. My (former) boss quit 3 months ago. He also told me he was ""pushed out"". My new boss told me he'll come up with some plans for the team, but it has been 3 months since he took over, and still no concrete plan. 

I know this situation is not uncommon, especially with big companies. Also many of my coworkers are in similar situation , but they don't seem to be bothered much. Some of them are actually enjoying it. The company I am working for is a multi-billion company that has been making net-profits around 100 million each quarter, but that does not mean they won't layoff people if they think they could increase profit. 

How much idleness would you tolerate before start searching for another job?"
Used dealership fired me over an accident that they want me to pay for.,"Okay, I am sorry in advance but this is going to be a long story. I figured if anywhere, this would be the best place to post this story. I have been thinking of posting this story since December but never got around to it. And with this story, I am not even including the following situations:

\-Straight up sexual harassment

\-sexism

\-drugs on premises 

\-finding a LOADED GUN in a car while photographing the inside 

So I took this job at a used car dealership as their photography assistant or “Webmaster” as they called it. At first, it sounded like an easy gig, having cars pulled into the booth for me and take some shots and on to the next one right? Wrong. So once I got hired, my boss has informed me that I needed to find, drive and park each of the cars into the booth myself and the only job the main photographer had was to find the cars for me and park them in front of my booth. Which this guy never did. He just goofed off while I did all the work and he got praised for it instead of me. They had never mentioned in the interview or anywhere that they needed me to know how to drive manual/stick shift cars. So when I told him that I didn't know how to drive stick, he told me not to worry and that he would get my co-worker to teach me. Well, that never happened. He just kept putting it off and telling me “oh, you won't actually have to do that. Just call me and i'll come to park it for you”. This was BS. I had to call this guy at least 10 times a day to ask him to move a car for me. And when I did, he made fun of me and complained that I didn't know how to drive stick. I only ever got trained by our mechanics that I became close friends with. And that was only two times that I ever actually drove a stick car. Very badly might I add. Fast forward to one day when I am photographing a Scion FR-S( a very nice sports car for those who don't know what that is). Once I got into the car to start it so that I could turn the tires for a side angle, this car jumps forward and hits the refrigerator that is directly in front of me. Now I had my foot on the brakes and the emergency brakes were on as well so I don't know why it did that.  Luckily no one was hurt but I was very shaken from it. After all of my co-workers came to see if I was okay, they checked it out and moved it to behind the building. The front left bumper was messed up and needed to be replaced, so when I was sat down by my co-worker, not even my boss about the details. I was confused when he said that they would make a contract and have my sign it and have 100-200 dollars deducted from my check each week and all bonuses we got each month as well once the car was fixed and they got the price for all of the damage. I was still shaken up so I just nodded along. After I got home and told my mom of the whole thing, she looked at me furiously and told me that they can't charge me for an accident that happened on the site because that's what insurance is for. I was unaware of this and looked it up and she was right. It is illegal for them to charge their employees for any damage done from an accident on the site. I even went so far as to call a lawyer to make sure this was true. Now, this ends up going quiet for about a month, until one meeting we had. There are meetings every Monday and Friday mornings before we start work, and the owner of the company asks me and my co-worker how many cars I am photographing a day and such. Then he proceeds to say jokingly “ well, maybe you can attend the driving school we have so that you don't crash any more cars.” or something like that. My mind’s a bit fuzzy on what he said so I am sorry for that. I was furious and just gave a fake smile as maybe 2 or 3 people faked laughed at it. I felt so embarrassed about it. Now I make fun of myself a lot and joke with people all the time. But when my boss just says something like that to me, that is not cool. So skipping to the next week. The car finally comes back from the shop and is put in the front lot to be sold already. Now here's the kicker... they never submitted the claims to Carfax so that they can update it and let the customer know that there was damage done to the car at one point. I know that for some cases, they don't have to (correct me if I'm wrong) but I knew that they should have for this case. So that day, my boss wanted to talk to me about how we were moving buildings and stuff like that. Then when he was done, i brought up the accident I told him that I do not believe that I had to pay damage on the car because it was not my fault and that there was no reason why insurance couldn't just pay for it. He then looks at me and proceeds to turn the blame on me that I got into the car and starting it, therefore it's my fault and that said “ wouldn't you feel guilty leaving a place knowing you did damage and didn't pay for it” Wtf?? I said no because it wasn't my fault and that I was never properly trained. He then says he will make up the contract and sent me away to continue working. I just left the room to stop myself from having a panic attack. He then called me back an hour later showing me the paper and demanding I sign it. Now I have the full recording of this conversation because I was on the phone with my mom who recorded the conversation. He then told my mom not to worry about it and that we had everything figured out. And then he again sends me away to go work and “not to worry about it” and so I did. 4 HOURS LATER, he calls me into an office and tells me that I am being fired because “it's just not working out”I just say okay and walk out of there and out of the building as fast as I can. I left after saying goodbye to my co-workers that I am friends with. I am debating on sueing them for wrongfully firing and try to get them to shut down but I'm not sure if I want to take legal action. Let me know in the comments what you think. Thanks for reading. :)"
How to tell if a company is a sinking ship and when to jump?,"My current company was purchased by a much larger company a year or so ago. Financially, we haven’t performed as the new owners would have liked and they are starting to make changes at the top of the tree. There currently isn’t any talk of serious cuts to people numbers but I’m wondering if it is time for me to move before it happens. Has anyone been through this sort of process? What were the warning signs before things got bad? Did you leave at the right time and when was it?"
got fired..,"So after 3 months of working in customer service (at a bakery), i got fired because i wasn't ""motivated"" enough, didn't smile enough, wasn't fast enough etc etc. I'm a really shy person but i was really doing my best and didn't think i was that horrible. The other job i had before i quit after a few months bc i was not getting payed all my hours... I will eventually look for another job and i wouldn't mind doing customer service at a nice place. I'd really like to work on my interpersonal skills and all. What can i say in an interview if they ask me why i stopped working there??"
Got fired today. It was 100% my fault. What now?,"I was fired today from my first full-time salaried job. It was an admin job at a big consulting company. I am 24, with little experience. I don't know anyone in my social circles who has been fired yet. After graduating a couple years ago, I struggled to get by, doing internships and contracted gigs. And only a month after I landed my first ""real"" job, I get fired on the spot.

And I completely deserved it. I was terrible at that admin job. I got multiple warnings for my performance and honestly, I saw this coming. I did my best to keep up, but I just did not have the skills for this role.

Prior to this job, I was in roles that involved research, analysis, and translation. I did good work, but it was all through unpaid internships or very lowly-paid contract work. The person I was working for on an informal contractual basis, let's call him Adam, was really happy with my contributions and said that he wished that I could have continued. But I didn't see any path to a full-time, 9-to-5 salaried job, so I left. 

I did have some outstanding research tasks for Adam, however, that I continued to work on over the weekends. So although I formerly left that role a month ago, I was still working on those tasks, and therefore do not technically have a gap in employment. 

&#x200B;

So what now?

Should I leave off this admin job from my resume and note that I continued working for Adam during that month? Would it be dishonest of me to do so? Would it be a red flag for a recruiter if I omitted the admin job? If they found out about it, how would I explain it?

I submitted my last assignment for Adam yesterday. This morning, he asked me how my new job was going. A couple hours later, I got fired. Should I tell him I got fired only after a few weeks of working there, and ask him if he can find a way to get me hired at the organization he works at? 

I made a good impression on him during my time working for him and he made it known multiple times that I did very good work for him. I feel ashamed about all this and I don't want this to affect his perception of me as a professional. Should I lie and say things are going well, and get back to him later telling him that I'm just ""looking to transition into something else""? 

I feel incompetent and worthless. Any and all advice would be helpful to me right now. "
Requesting days off,"Is it possible to be fired just for requesting days off? I work as a stocker at Walmart 4 days a week and want to request a week off at the beginning of July, and a week off at the end of October, however I'm worried I'll be fired? Any help/info is appreciated!!"
A friend of mine moved back in with his family because his dad was laid off.,"His current action plan:

*Get a second job 

*Get his dad a job at his current workplace

I suggested rideshare and/or food delivery as a second job (makes his own hours and I assume almost he can immediately start working).

Any other part-time/gig jobs I can suggest?

His main job may have an extra shift here or there but no guaranteed overtime and fixed salary (promotion is the only way to get a bigger salary)."
Chances of Rehire?,"Scenario: 

A Fortune 100 company is reducing staff in one area of the business, and lays off a 14 year, vested, top performing employee. 

The employee seeks opportunities for rehire with a different division of the same company. The employee finds SEVERAL qualified job openings on the companies site, and applies for the positions. 

Thus far (8 months), the employee draws no interest whatsoever from the company or its recruiters. 

Is it reasonable to believe that companies actually want to bring back their top performing employees (if possible)? 

These employees have already proven themselves, know the company culture, etc. 

Your thoughts please?"
Can I be fired for something I cannot physically improve.,"Hi,

Okay so i'm absolutely terrified that i'm going to get fired and so I've come here for some reassurance or advice or something to try and make me less of a panicky mess.   
I work at a dog boarding facility in Ontario Canada and while my actual work with the dogs is excellent the more practical side of things is a poopshow. We have a set time for cleaning out the kennels and I am constantly lagging behind. I have absolutely no idea why. I am going as fast as I can and  at what is an uncomfortable pace for me and yet i'm always finishing about half hour behind everyone else at the very least.   


I got totally chewed out yesterday for it (and honestly thought I was going to burst into tears because I am apparently a strong independent adult)  and now I have to outline why I cannot meet my time goals to the boss. But....I have no idea?  I literally cannot go any faster, I spend 2+ hours out of breath and covered in sweat as I am actually going full pelt (with all the water on the floor and my clumsiness that's caused a fair few injuries including one fairly nasty head injury, the speed isn't exactly helping my asthma either)  


The only explanation I can think of is that I am dyspraxic which often makes people slower than their peers at physical tasks but...that feels like a lame excuse? I have disclosed I have dyspraxia to my boss but it felt like I was making excuses there again.   


Maybe i'm just an idiot or being lazy or something? I seriously don't know.

&#x200B;

So can I be fired for being slow?  Can they fire me despite offering no help or solutions to my slowness?  Is having stunted motor neurons a valid reason for being slow and therefore a reason to fire me?  


I'm freaking out I cannot lose this job, i'd be so screwed if I did...my medical bills would probably be lower though. But then again i'd be homeless so..,

&#x200B;

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!

"Is it unethical to say you are still employed at an old company, if you were recently fired from that company, but they said they will give you a clean reference?","I just got fired from my job (financial services). Reason was performance, I didn't like the job; but I honestly did try my hardest. But in the end, I wasn't good enough at it, so they let me go, performance being the reason. Overall, I would say I was well liked at this company, and most people were upset to hear what happened. I think this might factor into why they agreed to only give future employers my basic information, as well as the dates I worked, no negative feedback on me, just a clean, neutral, but not necessarily good reference.

Everyone knows its better to look for a job when you are already employed, and since this separation happened very very recently (a few days ago), would it be entirely unethical to market myself and speak as if I am a currently employed person looking for new opportunities? Just for the next week or two, so they gap is so small, it could look inconsequential. Or would I be shooting myself in the foot if they call my old job and ask for specific dates of hire, and then they would know that when I interviewed them I was already not working there?"
Meeting with the Bobs coming,"Without getting into too many details, I have a desk job for a bank where I don’t necessarily do a whole lot all day, and the story is the same for others that I work with whom I’ve talked to. The company isn’t doing great financially, and I’ve long since accepted that this job is what it is for now, but take it one day at a time and don’t get too comfortable because consolidation and downsizing is almost certainly inevitable. Today they sent out an email that started out cheery and optimistic and then ended with “Oh yeah, we’re scheduling meetings over the next couple of weeks with some company that is going to give us an overview of the organization and blah blah blah”. Needless to say, it’s a bunch of bullshit to try and mask the fact that an efficiency consulting firm is coming in and at least some if not all of the people who work here will have to essentially interview for their job again.

Has anyone ever worked for a company that has done this? Do these sorts of consultants typically come in with a scalpel or an axe? I know this place has a lot of middle management that is probably overpaid and underworked, so those are the types I would assume should be nervous, but should stuff like this typically be a cause for worry for everyone from the top down and a sign of bigger changes to come?"
Recently Unemployed,"Good morning all. As the title states, I am recently unemployed due to a corporate merger/acquisition with another firm and the necessary cuts made when this happens. Simply, my position was not needed at the new company, and they did not have any openings where I would have been a good fit. 

Here’s my dilemma: I’ve been in this industry (Transportation) since 2006, and it’s fair to say I’m not a rookie. It’s also fair to say that I am not qualified for an executive level position. In my area, however there are very few opportunities that are between entry level and executive level. This makes my job search a little extra challenging. 

For the first 10 years, I was a driver in various capacities and have been working on the admin side for the past 3 years as a broker, a dispatcher, and most recently a recruiter. I think it’s fair to say also that I’m well rounded in several aspects of the industry. I am not interested in going back into driving, unless that becomes absolutely necessary. 

Any advice that could be given as to finding the few openings that are in the middle ground, or perhaps other industries that I could transition to, would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"
"Got Fired, looking for advice","Hi, so here is a brief run down on why I was fired from Taco Bell: One day, I tried to clock in, but the system said I was terminated, so I worked 3 hectic hours (because he was busy on phone calls) before I told my boss that the system said I was terminated. He told me to just go home because 27 people were randomly removed and he would need to get me back in the system. So I wait 24 hours and text him. No response. I text him again... and call. No response. I came in today thinking I had the wrong number when the manager told me I was fired. He said the reason was because during the time I was working , I apparently took 3 fake 20 dollar bills and add that to the fact I was already accident;y terminated. Here is some background info: It was my 4th day working cash register (probably 5th at Taco Bell) and there was twice as many customers as normal because of broken drive thru. Also, I was never told or trained to check 20 dollar bills at all -- I was only told to check for fake 50s and 100s.

Should I complain or do something about getting fired for this? I have had friends who have lost more money and kept their jobs.

TLDR; Lost 60 bucks from register and got fired despite being extremely new and not being trained to check for fake 20s. Should I complain to corporate and do something or is this common in fast food jobs?"
Do you care about your job?,"Or are you just doing something that can pay the bills?

I was laid off on Monday, part of the Barnes & Noble “we’re going out of business” layoffs. I loved my job. I was there for 10.5 years. I hated the company, have hated them for several years, but I loved my job. I cared about my job, not just in the work ethic sense but in a passionate way. Bookstores are important, even with the continued rise of the web and digital, it’s important to have physical bookstores. I could go on an on but that’s not what this post is about. That old phrase “turn your hobby into a job and you’ll never work a day in your life.”

I’ve casually looked at job boards, I’m not in a rush I have a severance through the end of April, I see a lot of openings that I’m well qualified for all of them making quite a bit more money than I did. I’ve known for years I could move and make more money. The problem is when I look at the jobs they are things I literally don’t care about. Sure I could easily get hired at Macy’s doing the same thing but I don’t care if someone buys a new shirt or not, for Best Buy I don’t care if anyone buys another TV just because a new model came out that is 4% better than the one they bought last year. I’ve looked outside of retail and am trying to figure out how to translate my skills (I’ll be making a different post about that) but again everything I see is for things I don’t care about. It feels like no matter what I do I will be doing something merely because I get a paycheck. I cared about selling books, I care about literacy, I care about expanding your mind by reading. 

Do you care about what you do, or is it just a paycheck?"
Given a Performance Improvement Plan,"So today I was given the dreaded PIP.

My boss sat me down, and said that our company has been having a rough quarter, and we have had quite a few meetings about reducing overhead. Unfortunately for me, My job is almost all overhead. When I was given the PIP, part of the improvement was bringing my billable hours up, but it's entirely dependent on other people giving me work (Work they themselves probably need right now!).  I have basically been able to maintain a 5% billable ratio, just with small assignments i'm given on top of my regular overhead tasks.  The plan is asking for a 55% billable rate by next month.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure if it's an impossible task and they're pushing me out, or if i'm just being short sighted. I have made a few other mistakes, and due to my lack of attention to detail it probably made me a prime candidate for someone to get rid of.   My boss is usually extremely fair, and she has gone above and beyond to be a good person in the past.  I just think it's an impossible task, because I have BEEN trying to become more utilized.  Our group is notorious for keeping all the work to themselves, and since we have small projects it has worked until now.

&#x200B;

When she gave me the PIP, she gave me a timeline of 3 weeks.  There were a few other requests, but the mountain to climb is becoming more billable.  She said at 1.5 weeks if things are not looking good, I can call it quits and still get paid for the remaining 1.5.  I am wondering if this seems like the situation where even if i pull off the impossible, I will still be fired.  I never want to be lazy, but if things are futile I think my efforts can be spent somewhere else.

&#x200B;

I am almost finished with college, I have about 4 classes this semester, and then 3 classes I was going to take online over the summer.  I have already started updating my resume, and this afternoon i'll start applying for jobs.    Any advice will be much appreciated.  I am overwhelmed and surprised by this.   I just had a performance review that went somewhat positive( I basically got the equivalent of a C at school), and not 2 weeks later I was given the PIP.

&#x200B;

TLDR:   Got a PIP, wondering  Is it hopeless?  Should I spent my 1.5 weeks looking for a job, and then the rest of the 1.5 weeks going to interviews?  Or should I just try my best?

Have you ever kept a job after stating unfair dismissal?,"Have you ever managed to keep a job after citing unfit dismissal? If so, how was working there afterwards? I always figured if this happened to me it’d be awkward cause now I know they didn’t want me there."
Running into the manager who laid you off,"I got laid off a while back, and I dread running into my manager or any of my former colleagues when I am walking around. In my town, people in my industry normally work and hang around in the same area. My manager's reason for laying me off was basically that they found someone who was ""better deal"" than I was. When I see my former colleagues, I rather just look the other way and move on. Other than the colleagues that I am close with, I don't really have much to say to the ones I am not close with. If I run into them, and were to have a conversation, I would feel embarrass that I get laid off. If you were ever laid off, how do you deal with this? Just running away or ignoring them solve the issue?"
"I think I got fired, but I'm not sure.","TL:DR: My new boss told me I may be getting fired soon, but I haven't received anything formally. I've also lost access to my work emails and the locks to the office have been changed. 

&#x200B;

I'm not exactly sure where or how to start, but I'm going to do my best to cover as much as I can so it makes sense.

&#x200B;

I work in student housing, and the company I work for has operations in multiple states. Each office varies in size depending on the needs of the property, but almost all work and communication with supervisors is done through emails and phone calls. The property I work at is small compared to the rest of the properties so our office staff has always been 4-7 people. My property is also only 2 years old, and most of the office staff has remained the same since before construction was completed.

&#x200B;

There was recently a change in management, but all of the staff remained so each property basically just reported to a new corporate team.  This new change was difficult for most of the members of my office, and the team that I had worked for 2 years started quitting one by one. When someone would quit, corporate was quick to replace them with someone from their other properties. I'm now the only employee remaining that's been here from the beginning and all of the new employees constantly ask me questions about the operations of the property. I'm not the property manager, but even the property manager that was brought in asks me questions about the property. 

&#x200B;

I also live at the property I work at, and two days ago on my day off my manager caught me while I was outside walking my dog. He approached me and told me that while he was working in the office with a corporate manager, they had received an email about ""dissolving"" my position at the property. That was all of the information that he gave me.  When I asked him if that meant I was fired, he said he didn't know, but that he just wanted to give me the heads up that it was coming. He also told me that they were planning on changing the locks at the end of the business day, so I would no longer have access to the office. After the office closed and everyone went home, I went to the office to see and my keys did not work. 

&#x200B;

It's been 2 days since this happened, and I've not received a phone call or an email regarding anything about my position in the company. I have also not gone into work, and every time I go to the office it is empty with a note on the door saying to call the mobile office phone for assistance. I've also lost access to all of my work emails and various accounts. I've been fired from a job before, and I had to complete a performance evaluation-esque form to formally terminate the position with the company. I'm not sure what to do and any advice would be greatly appreciated."
"Laid off yesterday from first job after college, already have two interviews for jobs I applied to several weeks ago. Do I tell my potential employers about the layoff?","Hi all, as the title says, I was laid off from my first post-college job yesterday (I started in June, so I was there for 7 months). The layoff was unexpected - I was dissatisfied at the company, but it seems that they realized they made a mistake in hiring me as they have never had enough work for me as a totally entry level person and ultimately didn't think I was the right fit for the job. Luckily the official language that I received about the layoff does not place any blame on me. I don't have a problem mentioning the layoff in the future, but I am wondering what to do about some jobs that I already applied for. I was pretty unhappy at my old company and started applying for jobs back in December, and just heard back from two of them earlier this week and this morning. I have interviews tomorrow and next week, but those interviewers do not know that I was laid off as I wasn't when I applied. How do I discuss this in interviews? Do I refer to my old job in past tense? Do I only mention if asked? My old employer was nice and offered to serve as a good reference, so they aren't upset or malicious - I'm just nervous because now I do really need a job. Thanks in advance everyone."
Layoff or Severance package?,"So a friend of mine is facing a layoff sooner or later. Writing is on the wall. Industry is in decline, layoffs every year, consolidation of departments from multiple sites in to a downsized departments servicing multiple sites, declining sales, upper management now sacrificing some middle management positions. Friend has been pretty safe due to multiple years of experience with the company in key positions. 

So to quote Shakespeare, ""To take severance or not to take severance. That is the question.""

Maximum severance is 20 weeks which he will cap out at so this is significant. OR should he brush off the old resume and start hitting the bricks? I will say that it is my opinion that this fellow is old school experienced. About nothing phases him about his line of work and he is good at it. However, the job market in this area for these positions is drying up so he will probably get hired but it will not be for what he is worth. Think about the movie ""The Intern"". He reminds me of DeNiro's character in this movie.

So what should I counsel him in doing? Hold out making more and possibly take a nice fat severance or cut your losses (and the current job frustrations) and just move on?"
Finance department is being outsourced - probably will lose my job freaked out about next steps,"So my company is going through a phased project to review accounting and finance departments for opportunities to out source.  My department is in the first phase and I'm positive that the work I do will end up going overseas.  The whole department is in a panic (think sinking ship) and I've been losing sleep.  I have an MBA and bachelors and a pretty solid track record performance wise (in accounting).  

&#x200B;

I'm just struggling with what to do next.. I've been with this company for 10 years and I'm hoping I can leverage my contacts to get a new job in another department in this company but I'm afraid that accounting and finance might not be as secure of a job as it used to be and I'll be jumping into a department that might get outsource along the line.  My resume is up to date and I've been applying but I'm afraid since I'm at the cap of my salary range I'll probably have to take a pay cut to move into my next role (a lower level job).  The company's job board has many entry level positions but no associate manager/specialist roles.  I'm afraid to look outside the company since I have connections here and the idea of being unemployed and all that goes with it scares the crap out of me.

&#x200B;

My career has had its ups and downs, the first 5 years I was doing really well, then I took a new job that was not a good fit for me. I had to leave within the year and take a lower level job. Its been three years since that so I've been promoted back up to my old level.  I'm not sure how best to spin that when interviewing.  Just posting this to get it off my chest and to see if anyone has had similar experiences."
Would you post a bad Glassdoor review?,"Sooo, I got a job a little bit ago. Perfect fit and everything. A week before my start date, they rescinded my offer because the company was going in a ""different direction"" (and then proceeded to lay a ton of people off a few weeks later). Apparently this is a cycle for them every few years. I had already quit my other job, of course, and luckily my old boss was gracious enough to keep me around.

Should I post a bad Glassdoor review, given that they'd probably know who posted it? Knowing this information, I'm pretty unlikely to want to work for them ever again, and I feel like people have a right to know...

Would you post it on the employee review part as well? I mean, I signed the papers and everything but it's not like I had actually worked there yet."
How to explain getting fired for attendance?,"Today I was fired from my job that I've been at for a little over 3 years due to my attendance. They clarified over and over that it had absolutely nothing wrong with my work performance or customer service- just my attendance. Either tardies or call ins. I can admit to that in the last couple of months I have been a bit flaky. I am sad as I loved the workplace I was at. Now I am worried what to write on applications under ""reason for leaving"" .. do I even put on there terminated or could I just say looking to move on? I need advice on this as I have never been fired before. My manager and I were on good terms, the problem was just my wrongdoing in attendance.

Feeling a bit lost. Thank you all in advance."

Should I tell them that my availability may change and what it may change to? 

Amy feedback welcome. 

Also my current job has had issues since Saturday. I’m off on weekends. I was there for 4 hours yesterday and sent home today."
"My employer has stopped paying me due to lack of funds, but they say I am not laid off. What’s the best way to handle this situation?","I’ve worked for my employer, a startup, since the end of May. There’s been 2 other times before when they were a day or two late with payroll. 

Monday was payday. I asked for my check and was told by the CEO and CFO that they have no money to pay payroll. They also informed me that other members of staff have taken extra stock options in lieu of pay, or are taking a “voluntary hiatus.”

I don’t know what to do. I know I can’t work for free. I would prefer not to go back to work until I get pay for my last pay period, but I don’t want it to be considered job abandonment and keep me from getting unemployment. 

What should I do in this situation?"
Just got laid off. Need some advice updating the resume of a digital marketer.,"So I got laid off from my ""first real job."" My company decided to change directions and figured that my team was no longer needed.

It feels a bit like a kick in the teeth since I didn't even last a year at this job and won't have a steady source of income for who knows how long but I'm not going to sit here feeling sorry for myself. First thing I did after that crappy meeting was contact everyone in my network to see if they know of any openings.  

&#x200B;

I guess my question is what sort of metrics are orgs/companies looking for when it comes to hiring a digital marketer?

So far, I listed stuff like:

1. Web optimization stuff like site load speed, bounce rates, and users.
2.  SEO stuff like SERP rankings for some of our pages. 
3. Conversion rates through our email marketing

Is there anything else I should be listing?

What skills should I list as well? I only know how to use Salesforce email service but don't really know how to use Salesforce itself. Should I list Salesforce anyway?

Trying to get back into my past company,"Hello r/jobs

I was laid off from SpaceX earlier this year during the 10% cut. They stated multiple times that we are allowed to reapply to any position in which we are qualified for. 
It’s been two months of being upset, angry, and overall down from losing the job I had, I spent a lot of my time in my late teens and early 20s getting the experience to one day work at SpaceX. 

There’s a position open in which I’m qualified for, and I’m really wanting to apply. I have an employee referral in, and wanted to write a cover letter for it. How would I go about writing a cover letter for a company I used to work for?
It’s a slightly different department than what I used to work in, and the reason why I’m trying to go above and beyond is because my last few months with SpaceX were hell in my personal life, some death and loss of family, so my last few months weren’t the greatest as I just kept to myself and worked quietly so I could go home and work out my personal problems, in which management in my old department said that they wanted me to be in the forefront again and work on all the issues but I couldn’t emotionally or mentally put myself there. 

Is this something I should bring up in my cover letter or do I just apply and go for it with a standard cover letter?"
Should i ride it out for potential redundancy pay or leave now?,"I've worked for a large company in the UK for the last 18 months. It's been the best job of my life so far, however it was anounced in April this year that the UK side of the business hasn't been profitable in a long time, and the company needed to make 350 redundancies in total this year. and they also had to make 150 redundancies last year.

&#x200B;

I work in the IT department doing 2nd line tech support. We were told by our boss after the original anouncement that these redundancies wouldn't affect us as we were needed so much, so I was pretty relaxed about the whole thing. last week it was anounced that the 1st line team (4 people in total) is being made redundant and their job is being moved to one of our offices in Poland, and now I can't help but feel like the 2nd line team (3 people in total) is next.

&#x200B;

I'm hesitant to just leave. I've had a lot of family issues recently (my dad was diagnosed with Brain cancer last November 2018 and died in February 2019) and my boss as the time was incredible to me. He gave me so much time to take my dad to appointments and sort out what I needed to sort out at home, and also gave me so much time to recover after he passed. He was always calling me outside of work to see if I was okay and if there was anything i needed and just being a generally great guy, so I have a massive amount of respect for him, and I feel like I owe him a huge debt. since then though, he was promoted in January/February 2019 and I've had 2 different managers since then, so everything seems all over the place and I don't know exactly what to do.

&#x200B;

My main question though.. should I ride it out for the redundancy pay and get a new job afterwards, or should i start looking now and abandon ship? I've never been in a position where I'll be made redundant before, so I'm not sure what happens in that situation. I believe I get 1 months salary for every year of service, so it wouldn't be a lot in redundancy pay. I've never had issues getting employment though. I was a contractor for a long time, and the longest I've ever been out of work was 4 weeks.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should also add that I have not been told whether or not I will be made redundant. At the moment we don't know anything, but i just have a nasty feeling that my team is next to go."
"Made redundant, help!","Hey all,

I’ve been made redundant from my job this week, along with 4 colleagues, including my boss, after being there for only 7 months. It’s due to a team restructure, and they’ve offered roles unrelated to my skills or pay grade (basically the equivalent of offering a Manager/Officer an Assistant job) as an alternative. My other option is I take a redundancy payout of a month’s pay, and go back to contract work until I find something else permanent. 

I’d been finding it a toxic environment for a while (no development opportunities, lack of training and support from my boss, no objectives, high staff turnover, really cliquey), so I’m wondering if I just see it as an opportunity to leave instead of settling for an unrelated position that could make me even less happy, and focus on finding something else that allows me to thrive and use my knowledge? My worry is not finding something quickly, sometimes it’s better to jobhunt whilst in a job - and paying my rent! But I’m quite experienced in my field (marketing), have lots of recruitment contacts and previously contracted/freelanced for 2 years - incidentally, after being made redundant somewhere else. They’ve given us a week to decide - it’s all out of the blue so I’m still processing. Any advice? "
Should I let an employee work after they know they will be fired?,"Basically we're moving locations and my boss doesn't want someone to continue at the new location due to performance issues. Is it better to tell them and let them work for the last couple days, or fire them outright.

Suspension/resignation advice,"I was suspended on June 10th pending a disciplinary process. Well the process is complete and I'm invited on Monday 24th to a hearing where a decision will be made.   


They have some strong evidence in the form of statements from my colleagues - I am guilty of some of the things they've accused me of. I do not want to fight the accusations and my resignation decision is final.  


My questions are:  


1. Should I resign now, ie. before the disciplinary hearing or during the hearing?  
2. When I do resign will I get paid for the 1 week notice period (the money would be a huge bonus)?  
3. How can I ensure that they pay me for my unused annual leave? I have spoken to a former employee who went through a similar process and wasn't paid for 6 days unused leave.

I'm in the UK fyi."
My department is being laid-off- what are the questions I need to be asking?,"So my company is letting go 95% of personnel in my department and as the only salaried employee in the department, I'm the only one that's been guaranteed a job. However, the job is a newly created position for the sole purpose of keeping me in their organization. I told my supervisor that this makes me nervous because there is nothing stopping them from deciding the position they made up isn't valuable enough later on... I don't see how any newly created position would have good job security. Plus I would be traveling (I will be compensated for gas) which I don't love.

&#x200B;

If I do accept this new position, it will be under the assumption that I can work on my sales skills to move into a salesperson position down the road. But that isn't necessarily what I want to be doing. Honestly I would be happy working part time and going back for my masters as well. My husband and I can live off his income alone but I don't want to leave the burden on him for any longer than absolutely necessary.

With this being said, my mind is reeling and I know I am not asking the right questions right now. If anyone has insight into my situation and the questions I should be asking my supervisor, all help is appreciated."
Was let go due to financial cutbacks. They aren’t paying out unused vacation. Some states require it. How do I find out if my state does?,"I was let go from my job today due to financial cutbacks. It really sucks as I loved this job. Great pay, benefits, work, and people. Best job I have ever had, but they company is in financial straits and left go 4 people in our main branch last month and myself and a couple other people in our branch today. 

They are giving me a severance and paying out my accumulated PTO but I still have around 60 hours of unused PTO. I did a bit of research and read that some states require unused PTO to be paid out. The HQ of my company is in Minnesota but the branch I work at is in Nebraska and they usually push everything through Minnesota regulations. Anyone know where I can find out if I am owed my unused PTO or not? I don’t think my company would try to screw me over, but they are a smallish company and only have one HR person so I can see this being overlooked. Thanks for any and all help!"
"Unable to find a job, questions about unemployment","I had been employed for a straight 20 years, since the day I turned 16, until being laid off in January. I worked in IT as a Business Systems Analyst but have been even applying to support positions and I’ve received only 3 calls, all of which never followed up despite them going well. I suspect the reason is that I do not gave a college degree. 

I am a single mom and had to give up my home and move in with my ex when I lost my job. I now only have a week and a half left of unemployment insurance before I am left with nothing. My barebone expenses are about $1700 (storage unit with all of my belongings, doctors appointment, my medications, car payment, etc) and I have no idea what I am going to do if I don’t get a job in a week and a half. I am an only child and neither of my parents can help me out. My credit sucks and my ex is barely staying afloat with the added expenses of me living here. With no extensions, I am literally about to lose everything I own and the medications I need to keep me alive. Even if I was lucky enough to land a retail job working 40 hours a week, I would need double of my state’s minimum wage to cover my expenses? What are my options here? Please help. "
"Fired from state job, will that affect future employment?","So a bit about what happened and where I worked, I was a Correctional Officer In NC, I was let go last week after an incident that happened in November, Basically I confiscated illegal drugs from an inmate and turned them into my Sergeant. The next day I was called into the office and asked why I didn't do the paperwork on it, all i could say at the time was I forgot about it. well anyways they report it to upper management and now months later they tell me they had me under investigation and that they were determining my termination tho they said it might not lead to that. fast forward a week later and im told that their decision was termination. Only thing I ever did was miss a few days but I had no write ups, i know i was at fault and there was no justifying my actions but I really hope this doesn't affect my search for a new job. I applied for a Telecomunicator position and im scared i might not be eligible..."
"Coping with layoff, getting back into the work force.","I got laid off from the job of my dreams. I did something silly and reapplied for it, relocated for it halfway across country for it out of pocket, took a nearly $4/hr pay cut to keep it. I had my reasons, but essentially, my mental illness caught up with me, I was hospitalized, and I quit for medical reasons. Fortunately I was approved for unemployment. 

I fancied being anti work for a few weeks, and living an alternative lifestyle, but I thought better of it. I digress. 

I worked in IT, within a help desk role. Many people call it hell desk, but I loved it. I learned to be fairly good at it and enjoyed doing the tasks, but what made it amazing was I loved the people I worked with, and I had an excellent manager. It was the first job I could tolerate working full time and over time. It was my first time not reliant on public assistance just to survive. 

I guess. . . I'm posting this looking for advice on how to move on and deal with the grief. Words of encouragement welcome. 

Thanks for listening."
"Got fired, do I need to personally deliver the company's property back?","I am a cleaner, and today I was terminated I over voicemail. The thing is, I still have their cleaning equipment that I had signed out. I am aware that I have to return it, but the office is a 35 minute drive, which is a huge financial burden for me. Not to mention the fact that I was at work with a supervisor the night before, and therefore I should have been fired then and there.

Do i personally have to deliver the supplies back, or can I just tell them to send a courier? If I refuse, am I technically stealing this property, even though they are free to relinquish it from me when they want? Can they bill me or withhold my final check?

EDIT: here's the ending to the story. I called my employers and told them that I will drop off the equipment at my earliest convenience, definitely within 30 days. They became anxious because I had keys to their accounts. If I kept the keys even tonight, then they would have to tell their customer about the security risk, they told me. 

I stated that I completely understand, but the city is a long drive and that it is a burden. They said we will give you compensation for gas, but if you don't comply we'll go to the police(which is standard protocol for them). I replied that I'm not withholding anything, and they can choose to grab it anytime they want, but I agreed to drop it off. 

Thanks everyone for your support! "
Just got fired but I can’t leave the office?,"I just got fired but my manager says he has to wait for HR to tell him what my last day is... but he says if I just leave now it’ll be considered quitting voluntarily. I’d rather be officially fired since I’m more likely to get unemployment then (this is in NY). 

Should I just leave now? I have an email and a recording proving that i was indeed fired. I was always under the impression that if someone got fired they had to leave immediately..."
Being paid to walk away from a job...should I?,"So...USA here. I work in IT as a project manager/business analyst at a prominent shipping company, and they’re doing a voluntary buyout in lieu of a layoff, where you get 4 weeks of salary per year of work and a $35k medical stipend (for Cobra insurance and expenses). For me, it’s 1.5 years worth of salary I’d get as a lump sum to walk away...and my family could be debt free (sans Mortgage) taking this buyout.

My concerns are if I can get a comparable job soon enough to where I’m not eating away at that large payout for day-to-day needs...and how do I broach this subject with employers (and my resume) when I am looking again? 

I’m not really enamored with the job, though I do get lots of vacation and I have a very lenient schedule...so I’m thinking about leaving. Does a lenient schedule, four weeks of vacation, but little career advancement (so far) and no bonus or pay raise for the foreseeable future sound like a job worth holding on to? "
"Fired from job within probationary period. Was offered a two-month contract that was supposed to allow me to work from home while seeking new employment. Boss has hit me with two huge, complicated, weird projects. What to do?","It's obviously busy work. My new contract is a definite two-month contract, which I have been told will be very difficult for them to terminate. The boss even said the contract could not be terminated, no matter what, bu it's obviously so they can find a replacement. (I'm in the EU.) 

Their reason for my firing was not trusting my skillset in a certain area in which I am inexperienced, and in which they promised to help me learn. They provided no teachable moments.

I don't plan on doing nothing during these two months, but you should see the stuff I was sent. It's as it was written by a madman. It makes no sense, is confusing, unorganized, and obviously just pulled from a back closet to keep me busy.

My question is, how do I handle this? I was fired for very sketchy reasons (I had great relationships with my team, I honestly was doing good work, trying as hard as I could, received nothing but praise from my superiors up until the day I was fired -- my line manager, my colleagues, everyone besides the higher-up is shocked and a bit angry by the decision to let me go).

This two-month contract, the boss said, was out of the ""goodness of his heart."" But there's no way any of this work can be completed within the 7 weeks I have left. Plus I have 6 days holiday, as I will have worked 3 months in total (probation month plus these two). So it's really six weeks.

How do I approach this in a manner that is going to cause the least waves?

I'm more than happy to do work that will help the company/my skillset, but this is ""A Beautiful Mind"" type shit. It's insane. I'm not trying to get out of work, but there's no way focusing my energy on this is going to help anyone. This, on top of several other projects I have going on for the company, which will improve my portfolio and help me in the future. What I have been given by this other boss is honestly a pile or rubble in Word doc form. I'm not meaning to bitch here, but it is indeed the truth.

To spend all my time on this would be to limit my time seeking new employment. Which is the point of this contract, according to them."
Reason to believe layoffs are coming. I'm a recent hire and this is my first non-entry level job in the field.,"The writing is on the wall and, even though I also have reason to believe the position (in general) is safe and I have been exceeding expectations, I would be a fool to not at least start thinking about the possibility. If I am laid off, I will probably have between 6 and 9 months of service.

&#x200B;

I moved across the country (US) for this position, starting fresh with nothing after college. Basically I need advice on how to best leverage a short time at an impressive position in case I'm laid off."
My dad is being laid off and has very little experience in searching and applying for jobs. Any tips?,"My 55 year old dad is being laid off from the auditor job he’s had for 18 years at a telecom company. He’s already doing his best to get another job, but I would greatly appreciate any helpful tips or links I can send him. I’m about to go to college so I don’t have much experience with applications, especially at his level."
"I was Terminated/Laid Off my job, need advice","I was recently let go from my job not due to performance but because the company said they are heading in a ""different direction.""

A little back story - Around December 2018, new ownership came in and started making a lot of changes, one of those changes were letting people go. My department was one of the first hit and there were obvious signs that my deparment would be reduced greatly. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to March - I was brought in and was told that they are letting me go and said that they are moving in a different direction. I asked for what reason based on the direction of the company, why I would not be kept. They would not provide me any information. They would not give me any type of feedback as much as I probed. I have never had any discplinary action nor have I ever signed any type of Performance improvement plan prior to the meeting. 

I never spoke to HR as well. 

I am trying to figure the best way to let future employers know of my situation. I am just being upfront, giving them the whole story. 

I look at this sitation as being laid off due to downsizing but I know the company is going to say they fired me. 

Any advice or thoughts would be apprecaited.

How to find out if my company is going to lay off one of it's call centers soon?,"I work for a fortune 500 company that has had a call center running for the last 10 years, and my company has been renting the building as its on the land that another company owns. There were no renovations being done during these 10 years of operations up until this last year. They have been redoing everything in the building, and I mean almost everything. Not only that, but there were three other departments in this building, who over the last year all have been laid off except for my department now. No one suspects that they will be closing the contact center except for me. 

Does anyone have an idea how I can find this out? I was thinking of calling the company that we lease the building from, and act like I am an interested leaser. but I have no clue how to go about this. What are your thoughts?"
Second time getting laid off in less than two years. Is this poor reflection on me?,"I’m a lab technician with my bachelors in biology. I have been working in labs for over 3 years now. 

First lab I worked at was a research grant funded position and they laid me off after two years due to my PI moving states and taking her grant funding with her. Afterwards I took a low paying job in a lab that I didn’t enjoy and only stayed there 6 months till I got my current job. My current job ive worked for 10 months contracting for a government laboratory. Yesterday I got word that the contract funding has been cut and so they have to close mine and two other peoples contracts by the end of this month. 


I’ve been beating myself up pretty hard about it. Given that this is the second time I have been laid off in less than two years. I can’t help but think this will reflect poorly upon me when it comes to applying for other jobs. Is it normal to be laid off this often? "
"After 6 months of starting a position in a new department, I am being forced out.","I joined my current company almost three years ago, and have spent the first two and a half years in a department that I have a direct degree in. My performance reviews were always above average and I've had great feedback from everyone, including our Director. The last six months have been spent in a related (but different) department, doing work that is much more stressful, more visible, and for more pay.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The person I first reported to left the division I now work in, and their subordinate, who has been with the company for many, many years, took on my old manager's role. To describe my working relationship with this person would be to describe a relationship that has become emotionally abusive. They do not trust me after making mistakes (6 months on the job, I remind you). They openly criticize me in public, using a demeaning tone. They micromanage me, tell me what to e-mail people, and berate me for small things and scold me for things that should require help and informative training.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Again, I have made mistakes. I am still learning. But apparently I am not learning fast enough. Instead of being given constructive criticism on how to improve, I am being told by my manager that unless I go back to my old department (a demotion), they will be put me on a type of ""performance"" program that will track everything I do to make sure I am improving to their standards - the standards which I am not currently meeting and am constantly trying to achieve to little affect. If I do not meet the expectations of this program, I will be let go. The kicker? I am not technically allowed to switch roles until I've been in my current one for at least a year. So I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This has blown me away as it's such a stark contrast to the praise I had previously been given. I am almost certain my manager has some sort of grudge or dislike towards me. Likely because I have been under-trained by my predecessor (who left as a result of getting burnt out) and because my manager expected me to be a prodigy child and learn everything within the first six months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So here I am, on a Friday night contemplating everything after being given the option to figuratively banish myself or face the failure set up by self-fulfilling prophecy I've developed from a lack of support. Any advice or words of support are appreciated. I don't know if I'll figure out the answer, but I think airing my grievances has helped.

Anyway, thanks for reading."
Should I stay at this job or quit? Would I get unemployment in this scenario?,"I have only been at the job for several months. I'm a machine operator at a manufacturing plant. The company has hit a slow period (so they say) and isn't running as many machines. I had a meeting with the HR manager and production manager today. They called us one by one to the HR office to talk about what is going on. Since I'm one of the newer people who doesn't know how to work all of the machines, they can't leave me as an operator presently. They want to demote me (and a lot of other people) from a production operator to a packer. That's over a $4/hr reduction in pay.

They overwork their employees. During a slow time like this, they'll want one operator trying to watch 5-6 (or sometimes more) ridiculously complicated machines. They want packers packing for several of their own machines, but during break time, you pack for your coworker's machines in addition to your own while they're on break. They do the same when you're on break. The whole process is broken. 8 machines is impossible no matter how fast you are. They pretty much told us either accept it or deny it and be laid off for like 1-2 months until business picks up.

I'm looking for another job, have lots of staffing agencies helping me find something reasonable (already completely all of their paperwork and interview process, just need an employer to interview with) and I just don't like the job. But I need the money for bills. Yet I can't go in to work and work myself to death figuratively with twice as many machines as is reasonable as a packer for much lower pay. Would I qualify for any unemployment if I just deny it and let them lay me off? They're doing this to people who have been there much longer than I have, as well. Yet my coworker told me they're going to demote our title to packers...but ask us for favors to watch machines while not in that job title. They're calling this the ""curtailment"" period. My previous production supervisor quit after years. My previous HR generalist quit. Lots of turnover at the company. The previous production manager just got reassigned to maintenance areas and no longer presides over production. It seems like they're lying and something big is happening. "
I got fired and I am lost / happy (?),"I got fire today because I was being negative at work , i told new comer not to come to work which I never did. But I kinda see that coming when I tell my colleges I will quit soon knowing there is sneaky mic and I have been saying it for a year.

I got abuse, called worthless, bad, dumbass, go kill yourself, everything you can imagine. I never fight back, I just take it and smile. When I told them I have a final so can I get a break, first thing she said is you should quit your school, you won’t succeed. 

Everyone at work know I got abuse, everyone was happy about me finally stand up for my self.
I finally say fk it, and bye, I am leaving today. At the end, they still have to give me the “is your problem, not me” attitude when literally everyone ask me to quit ASAP because what horrible bosses they are.

I am worry they will messed up my resume and jobs that I worked for almost 2 years. I give them the letter today and done with it. Should I still write it on my resume. It is a small company and not sure what will they do. 

I am doing lots of courses (CPA related, should be in CPA pep around August) right now so i actually have things to focus. But they end around July. Should I go get a job, should I finish it? Can someone share your though?

Am I About to Get Fired?," x-post /r/careerguidance

&#x200B;

In June I started a new job at a large hospital in a major US city. My job requires me to work closely with four different inpatient units throughout the hospital on various quality and process improvement projects. Everything from reducing infections to increasing patient satisfaction. I've worked in healthcare since graduating undergrad, but am new to this type of work. I have a Master's degree, but am only 28 and haven't had much experience managing teams and leading projects.

I'm working with people who have 5-20+ years of experience on me. During a conversation with my boss in August, we discussed where I think I'm doing well and where I'm struggling. I was told that since I have less experience than my colleagues, they understood mentorship was important. I've been working with two of my colleagues to help me get more comfortable in my role. The mentorship has been going on for a few months, but became more formal in October. I thought I was making progress, but today I had another meeting with my boss; she mentioned they aren't sure if I'm making progress at the expected rate and she wants to meet with me Monday to have a conversation about if I think this is the right position for me and next steps. She wants this to be a comfortable conversation for us both, and doesn't want me to feel intimidated, but I'm freaking out. My company has a six month probationary period for new hires and I'm coming up on six months at the end of this month.

Am I about to get fired? What do you all think will likely happen Monday? From our conversation, I'm not sure if they are planning on firing me or if there are opportunities for me to move into another position at the hospital where I may be better qualified at this stage in my career. I'm going to go in with my thoughts on what I need to do for each of my four units (what they need to do to get back on track) and the steps I think I need to take to get them there. We also agreed on mentorship, but didn't establish goals to show what progress would look like or a timeline for improvement. Is there anything else I should do? Thank you all for your help. I appreciate your insight!"
Calling in sick with 2 days in between,"So I have the stomach flu currently, most likely from New Years Eve Dinner, and been getting barely any sleep the past few days due to cramps and needing to go to the washroom throughout the night. I currently work as a part time employee, and I have called in sick 2 days prior to today (I was not scheduled for Thursday and Friday to be clear), but had a friend of mine cover for me. I am not feeling any much better today, but does anyone have any input if it would jeopardize my job if I called in sick again today? "
Can you put a price on job security?,"  

I am a mid-level manager for a very large BPO, work from home on the west coast, and have an overall team of 19 individuals located in other countries that I manage remotely. I’m a college dropout that started entry level, and worked my way up through the company starting in 2010. 4 years ago, my current employer acquired my previous one, and I survived the acquisition with a pay increase and increased responsibilities. Well, now my current employer has been acquired by another company, and my hopes of surviving this acquisition are very low for a variety of reasons. 

&#x200B;

This has been a roller coaster of employment for the entire 8 years I’ve worked for this company, and the go-to motto is “Embrace Change” but that usually means layoffs, restructuring, and other negative things. I love my job, the work that I do, and the people that I manage, but I’ve rarely gone more than 2 months at a time without a sinking feeling or sense of dread that I’d be next on the list of RIFs. All in all, every single person that I counted as a friend has been laid off over the last 3 years, and I am all that's left.

&#x200B;

Because this is my only real career that I’ve ever had, I have no idea if this horrendous lack of job security is normal for everyone, normal for the industry I’ve gotten sucked into, or only normal for the company that I have the pleasure of working for.

&#x200B;

I’m about to hit the job market again, and would like to get some insight into how much people value job security, or if it’s take-what-you-can-get. I’d love to start, you know, planning to buy a house, but I cannot fathom taking that risk not knowing what’s around the corner."
"Got Let Go Today- FL, USA","After two weeks, I've been let go from my job. Specifically cited in my boss's speech was the panic attack I had yesterday.

Until today, my boss hands me my paycheck and fires me. She says business is slow and I'm not capable of handling the job. She said she'd give me a letter of recommendation if I needed one.

"Paranoid about layoffs - payroll looking at my LinkedIn profile, is this a bad sign?","I work for a company in the healthcare sector. We were acquired by a much larger company several years ago and now they are finally getting their vision together for what they are going to do with us.

Is there any sort of situation where it’s subtly harmful to ask your boss about your job security?,"Such as perhaps if your job isn’t necessarily in danger, but you asking the question strengthens the thought in the boss’s head?"
How to know if your job is at risk?,"Last month, I got promoted to a leadership position in a bad department. I got on-the-job training from my supervisor.

At the conclusion of my training, my supervisor told me I was doing great, but they never told me to update my credentials; nor did they extend a formal offer—customary procedure in the company.

In fact, they didn’t extend an offer until I messaged their supervisor, asking if I could chat. Instead of replying to my message, they simply told me they’d like to extend a formal offer and that my pay would be upgraded immediately.

Fast forward a couple weeks, they haven’t upgraded my pay, and they haven’t extended the formal offer in writing.

Our department has been failing to meet numbers this whole time, and it’s so bad that I have begun to wonder if they’ll even want to retain me.

But I texted my boss’s boss to ask if I was gonna get my official promotion, and they say they’ll bring a formal letter to the office tomorrow.

But they never show up to our office, and my boss was off today. So are they just saying that, when they’re actually planning on delivering bad news?"

This has been an extremely difficult decision to make. If I do join the startup then I feel I would have missed out on the traditional route of graduating and working at a proper firm with a stable salary and a proper learning framework.

Im the only videographer/ motion graphic artist in my company hence i have to deal with projects for all the clients. I know leaving the job is not an option as it the worse possible time to do so. 
How do i move about this situation? 
Im barely making money and feel stagnant at this point of time."
So my boss won't let me impress him,"I work for a small startup and in a startup it's common to work outside your job description and put on many hats. I want to get promoted and impress. I'm thinking and analyzing the strategic situation of the company and want to provide the best ROI for my salary to the company. This is mostly because I want better job, better salaries, better pay etc. 

And then I'm trying to get an MBA which is all about demonstrating success, promotions and leadership.

The problem is that my boss won't really let me. I fulfill my main responsibilities pretty well. However any idea I give to my boss gets shot down and he just tells me to do my job. I once worked one a branding guide and showed it to my boss and he tells me that I wasted my time and got angry. I offered to write research papers, blog posts, and liason with specialists for new product research, but that got shot down. I demonstrate products with skills that I have, but all that gets shut down. Despite me doing the work and fulfiling my main responsibilities (I'm the top worker in the team). I asked my boss directly what problems he has, how best I can address them, and that I can provide a lot more to the company than my main responsibilites, and he tells me to stop wasting time and do your job. 

Do I need to look for another job? I've been at this for 6 months. It feels like a deadend. I'm not learning anything useful, and I am not just not being given the ability to impress.

I'll feel like I'll never get into a good MBA program with the job that I have."
Signs a Startup is Failing?,"I got hired as a contractor three months ago at a startup. It's not a proper startup because they have an international presence, but the American branch is barely 6 months old. This is the second time they are trying to break into the American market after failing to do so in 2015/2016.

I really like the company and my coworkers, but lately I have become consumed by the idea that our branch is failing. There is absolutely zero leadership, which at first they pitched as a positive, but when they had a CEO candidate leave them at the altar after 3 interviews (including flying the person out to the international HQ), I started to fear that they were just clueless.

Without getting too specific, they recently launched a big new product feature, which isn't optimized for mobile. I was excited for this feature to launch, I was working to help make it happen, and then my jaw hit the floor when I realized that nobody had deisgned this feature with mobile in mind. Can't say how long that feature was in development for but I would guess over 6 months.

Last month (they only pay once a month which sucks), my paycheck was delayed by 9 days. I followed up and apparently my invoice was never submitted to accounting. My boss put me in touch with accounting and it was resolved the next day, but it still made me very nervous to be paid late. I tried writing that off as I'm a contractor and they're disorganized, but in combination with everything else, it feels ominous.

Today, I realized that our new registrations in January were less than half of what they were in September. I honestly don't think anybody else in my branch is even aware of this.

There's other things I could describe and you only have limited info but I am terrified this place is failing. Yet, just last week I was given a permanent ID, and just yesterday the snacks, soda and beer was restocked so what do I know?

TLDR: What are some signs a company is failing, particularly a startup?"
Are these valid concerns?,"Got offered a job as a TSR in this apartment complex downtown. All I know is that they are a non profit organization who provide subsidized housing for low to middle income individuals/families. Their base salary is almost 20k more than what I currently make and the benefits are amazing. Due to the COVID19 situation, they will have me working remotely until the threat is gone. I am a recent graduate and I am struggling financially. It seems like a good opportunity for development and will allow me to pay the bills until I find a job in my field. However, I know a lot of companies tend to hide the negative aspects of working for them during the recruiting process and compensate with a higher salary, especially now during the pandemic. I was wondering whether or not some of my concerns are valid.

1. I have no idea what the office inside looks like, but the building itself is absolutely hideous - it makes me question what the atmosphere must be like. I have no idea what type of people I'll be working with for the first few weeks of employment. I don't want to be stuck with jerks or zombies for coworkers.
2. Instability - Since they are a non profit organization, there is less job security. If the funding gets suspended or the donations are low, what happens to my salary? Why is this position vacant?
3. Possible burnout - The job description mentions ""the incumbent may experience considerable amounts of stress."" Looks like a huge red flag.
4. $80/month for parking, having to commute downtown and back to the east end during peak hours."
Questions for an interview with a startup,"Hi, I have an upcoming interview with a start up company. I've worked for a ""start up"" previously, though that was far more established than what this company appears to be. So along those lines, the though of moving my family across the country for something that is less certain than my current job is a big concern. 

I'm looking for some questions to ask to vet the company when I have this interview. Technically I feel comfortable with a back and forth with the interviewer, but for the business side, I'm less sure.

Does anyone have some ideas of what to ask?"
Starting Wendy’s Today,"I’m starting today in about 7 hours. Any advice from current/former Wendy’s employees before I go? I’m 18 years old and it’s only my second job, my first job was for a month, so not long. What should I expect?

Update: sorry for taking so long. The job is great, at first I was VERY nervous, but now, it’s great. Everyone’s nice to each other, and I even get to make my own meals for home before closing. The only thing bothering me are my feet, after 9+ hours of working, my feet KILL me at the end of my shift. I hate it. Other than that, it’s great. I appreciate all of the help before I started! It really helped me out! Ask me any questions about it if you’d like. I’ll happily answer!"
How do i get into the IT field?,"I've only got experience with Microsoft Office and Windows. Been using computers my whole 24 years of life. I couldn't afford the SAT in high school, and my grades were average. I've only ever had one job at a warehouse (5 years now sadly.) 

Where do I start? Should I jump into a trade school? Should I find a better warehouse job and use that to put me through school? Go to a community college and get my credentials? Should I look for an entry level position with on field training? 

I'm currently working a dead end job at a K-mart DC, staying with my parents and working a full time job. I want to take care of my girlfriend with a job that actually has a **future.** How do i begin this journey? I'd prefer anything in Southern California if possible. I'm sorry I don't know where else to ask..."
"If I have equity at work, is it okay to ask for a raise closer to market rate?","I have been working at a startup for 3 years now. I'm a founding member and worked without salary (for equity) for about a year and a few months. Fortunately, things have been going well for us and we've been growing at a steady pace. About a year ago, we hired another woman at my level of seniority: about 7 years in the industry. I recently found out she's making more money per year than I am (about $15k more, $20k more would get me to market rate). I know she has less equity than I do, but this still feels unfair because I've been here 2 years longer, and have never received a raise. I currently oversee production in my department, we bring in the majority of new revenue, and the CEO has commented on it.

I want to ask for a raise but I'm not sure if it's standard in the industry to pay a founding member below market rate in exchange for higher equity. There's some additional tension in that I am the only woman of color in the company (person of color, really). I feel a little bit taken advantage of right now. Any advice on how to proceed?"
Unemployed for 6 months and now for the first time starting as a bank teller! I need your tips!,"Just like everyone else I had no clue what I was doing with my life and enrolled in an arts related post secondary institution that only year and a half later left me with a useless diploma and 35 grand in debt.

I’m struggling with employment at the moment,"The title basically says it all but I’m struggling with employment at the moment.

Advice for working in an aerospace startup,"Hi,

What are some general do's and don'ts of working in an aerospace startup?"
Work schedule?,"Hey! I don’t know if I can post this here but I am really new at my job, I’ve been looking for a job for like 1 year and finally gotten one. 
I’m just 18, and still in school. 
My job has an app to handle work schedules and such, and I’ve just gotten a looot of work. 
At least more than I thought I would get according to the job info. 
I have no issue working it’s just that when I already go to school 8 hours a day, and then work until midnight, and then opening shift at 11 in the morning the next day(weekend) I feel a bit overwhelmed.. 

To sum it up; my question is, am I allowed to talk to my boss and ask if we could work out my job schedule together? At least in the start and explain what would work best for me? Or would that be considered rude for a new employee?"
Given 2 Equally Awful Options at My Company,"**Edit**: I do have equity in this company. Forgot to include that.

To put it in perspective, I've been working with this company before it became an official LLC. I worked for free for almost 3 years to make this happen because I was passionate about the we were doing and I wanted to see this company succeed. I still do, but after what I was informed I'm actually shook right now.

I was originally brought on as remote full-time and eventually I'd have to move to their HQ (where the majority of the workers were.) Fair enough, I didn't get paid even close to what I should be making at the start but we were an early company and I believed in the vision, so I understood that my fiancee (girlfriend at the time) and I would have to move there eventually. My thought process was if I got a salary adjustment, my fiancee and I would discuss it more in depth and finally decide when the time would be right (which would primarily be with the salary adjustment since I live in a very expensive area currently, and saving up has almost been impossible.)

So the months go on and here I am at about 9 months as a full-time employee. I get informed last night that I have two options:

**1.)** Move there with a slight salary increase (a super small percentage of an even lower than entry-level salary given 6 years in my field), 12 months of guaranteed employment, and they'd give me a small amount for travel (less than $1,000.)

**2.)** Become a contractor and lose all my benefits (and eventually be pushed out when they found someone more local to them.)

I am absolutely devastated right now. The incentive for moving is not there, and even made worse that I have to pay an absurd amount for a lease break among other financial commitments coming up (we literally just signed for a wedding venue *yesterday*.) Since I couldn't save up a lot I would clearly be going into the red for this move, and as much as my fiancee is well-off financially and can help afford things, I can't place her into this financial burden with me. On top of this, she would have to find a new job there and disconnect from all of her friends and social activities she does. I feel ashamed

On the other hand, going contractor literally feels like I'm losing my job but in a ""nice corporate way."" I would have to get on my fiancee's health insurance through eloping early because I have a reoccurring medical condition and I *have* to have decent insurance for, less I pay an absurd out-of-pocket every year. Then finding a job around where I live would be insanely difficult because the market for my career here is abysmal. I worked too hard for this...

I'm at a loss. I talk to my CEO today in a few hours to hear more about it, but after busting my ass for almost 5 years working 60-80 hour weeks... I don't know. 

I have nothing to ask of anyone, so I suppose this is just a warning to people: a company doesn't give a fuck about you if it means saving them money.

Be careful out there."

“Casual” dress code for first day?,"Ok, background: I start a new job next week. It’s my first job that isn’t technically retail and it’s my first job post-college. I have been looking, applying, and interviewing since January so this is a big deal for me. It is a customer service based job but it takes place in a warehouse location and it is also a startup company. 

The dress code is casual, and while my supervisor told me jeans and a t-shirt, I’m not sure if I should go that casual on the first day. I was thinking jeans and a nicer top, but not too nice as to be “interview nice.” I know this sounds like I’m needlessly worrying, but I feel like this first impression with meeting coworkers is important: I don’t want to be dressed so nicely that I look like I can’t do anything useful or that I’m sucking up, but I also don’t want to look like I’m taking total advantage of the casual dress code. I realize people are very judgmental (even if subconscious) so I want to make sure I can fit with their environment and culture. 

You all have much more experience than I do, so I’m curious about your thoughts or suggestions. 

Thanks!"
Hot tip for landing a job at a tech startup,"Create an online course on Udemy for the software of the company you are interested in working for. There are tons of resources out there to help you create an online course and you could use one of the many free screen capture tools out there to create the videos. After the course is published, apply to the company and mention the course. Even if the course isn’t spectacular, it still demonstrates your interest in the company and should propel you above the other candidates.

This idea worked for me - I just accepted a job offer to the company I had made an online course for. It goes without saying that you still need to have some relevant experience and kill the interviews. An online course might just help you get your foot in the door."
Has anyone worked for as a employee for a small local business?,"Something like maybe a pool cleaning company or a lawn care company, house renovating company or things like that sorta small local businesses if that makes sense.

I'm from Florida so theres a lot of these little business out there was wondering what its like to work for them as i'm seeing a few listing on Craigslist about it. Specifically a pool cleaning business they give you a truck and train you up seems more fun than working a desk job.

If anyone can share their experience with this top of job and what the pay was like i'd appreciate it!"
Project Manager resigning & HR told me I'm getting a raise because of new responsibilities,"For context, I work at a small startup, basically. The CEO is basically a Developer, there's a Project Manager and I, a QA Engineer. I was hired mid-late March & so far everything is great...staff, flexibility, future prospects ect. Overall its been a pleasant experience. Obviously there's a 3 month evaluation period before getting a raise which so far I've been doing great.

Yesterday, the Project Manager handed in his resignation letter. He knows & does a lot of stuff I don't know how to do or I'm not very good at, like meetings with the clients, figuring out the exact requirements for them ect. Overall just a dude with way more experience that I am, he has around 10+ years in the industry while I only have 2 & around 3 with IT.

HR called me in by the end of the day and revealed that he'd be quitting, that I'd be assuming new responsibilities and because of this I'd be getting a raise. She didn't exactly tell me of how much because it was at the end of the day and on Monday we'll be having a meeting with the Project Manager, the CEO, HR & myself to do an action plan because this caught us off guard. There's a lot in the backlog so we'll struggle.

What I'm concerned about is basically I'm getting a raise before my 3 month evaluation is over, which honestly has caught me off guard. How should I go about this to negotiate more or atleast if I can't, to lay the groundwork for a future raise. Not really sure how to tackle this.

Thanks in advance."
Company asked me to make a template for them but ghosted me right after. Was I scammed?,"Had a phone interview at a startup last Thursday and it was the weirdest thing ever. She never really asked me about what I can do for their company or even tried getting to know me. I felt like they were milking information off me such as asking, ""So at your company, what programs or tools do you use for x and x"" and even asked me to make THREE templates that their company can use to reach out to influencers/businesses. She told me to get it done ASAP and so my stupid self did. I made a two page template plus a detailed explanation on why I think this would work for them. I submitted it Thursday, followed up yesterday (Tuesday) but never got a reply.

I felt like they just wanted to use me to to make a template so they can use it themselves for their own good. It's kinda annoying when you get rushed into creating something you're not getting paid for and then just get ghosted after. Smh.

How do I ask my boss for the raise I was promised,OK I need some advice when I started my job which I had worked at previously and they said whenever I wanted to come back I always could I asked what they would be starting me at and they asked me what I was looking for I told him that I had another job offer starting me at $12-$13 an hour the owner of the company said they could easily meet that no problem well they started me at $11 an hour fast forward after my three month probation and they’ve raised me only $.50 so I am currently at 11.50 an hour and my husband keeps pressuring me to either quit And find a better paying job or ask for my raise up to 12 or $13 an hour but they said that they would be doing I love my job and I love what I do I do not want to quit any advice on how I can approach the owner to bring up the subject of hey when I originally came to apply for the job we agreed on such and such and I’m still not there?

"The Start Up I work for was bought, and nothing has been changing. Is it a bad sign?","Hello everybody! I don’t know if this is the right place to post this. But I’m working for a startup and I’m seeing some concerning things.

I was really excited about working for a startup. It would be lots of work and it was a major leap after struggling to find a full time job. I’ve been there 7 months or so and over time I was seeing things I didn’t like but thought I’d tough it out.

Now, things are getting bad it feels like. We were just purchased by another company. The CEO and his wife, whom he works with, met with us individually. Not one big meeting, but meeting with employees alone. It was weird but tried not to think too much of it. Yet everything has slowed down. To the point that there is nothing to do. And the CEO does not like seeing his employees not working. He already has an attitude, is quicker to criticize than reward. Priorities shift on his whim. He once said to me “if I find that thing, I’m gonna be pissed. I’ll fucking kill you”. I tried not to read too much into it, but it was shocking. But he talks to everybody that way.

We also have not seen the people who bought us. They have not spoken too any of the employees or anything. Yet we know we will be moving locations. But we don’t know where.

That’s just some of the stuff. It always seemed like there were all these pieces, yet none of them were moving in the same direction. Now it just seems like we are in a sort of limbo and not being told anything. Especially since I just learned from a coworker our last two paychecks were paid out of the CEO’s pocket. Too anyone who has worked or owned a start up, is this sort of thing normal after a buy out? Is there always a strange period of silence or not knowing what’s going to happen?

A lot of us are looking for new jobs. We have even made jokes that we’re going to come to work and the doors are barred or we’re raided. Are we being paranoid or do we have a right to be afraid?"
New job misled me... should I quit or stay for the resume boost?,"Hi all, TLDR on the bottom. 

 I just got a job at a biotech startup three weeks ago and I thought everything was going great until this week... it seems like they’ve misled me to believe what my job is and what experience and skills I can gain from it. 

When I interviewed, I was straight forward with them and told them I’m doing this for the experience because I have a year experience at a previous startup as an Administrative and Operations Manager and I’m looking to cultivate skills and experience in operations, production management, supply chain, etc. because I don’t want to be an Office Manager/admin worker forever. And I asked them if this is a position that can offer that growth and they reassured me that there’s so much potential for growth in this job. They made it seem like keeping the office tidy was only 15% of my job (office manager... duh) but a couple days ago the VP of Operations that I’ve been supporting and assisting sat me down and basically tried to be casual and say that my job is to keep the office tidy... but I don’t have to worry about cleaning the toilet (his words not mine). Even though we have professional cleaners that come in once a week... this was even listed on the job ad. 

So what I’ve been doing... learning the operations, helping with logistics and the production paperwork isn’t my priority and the majority of my time should be spent keeping the office tidy. 

Later that night, I got an email from the CEO saying that he thinks that the VP got a chance to talk to me, so he just wants to reiterate what my job responsibilities are “moving forward.” And it’s again listing stuff like making sure I sweep, clean the kitchen tables, wipe down stuff... etc. and I also got an email from the VP with “supporting documents” attached saying what my job responsibilities were... #1 &#2 were cleaning related, and then #3 is policing others who prevent me from doing the above... 

So... I feel like I’ve been totally misled because it seems like they just want an office mom and they misled me to believe I would be doing a lot of the management/OTHER business related stuff... not clean. Oh and they don’t clean after themselves... they want me to pick up used coffee mugs, napkins, wrappers that accumulate on their desks. 

What should I do? Do I stay for 6 months and list this on my resume, or should I look for another job?  Of course, I wouldn’t quit until I find another job but... I’m pretty discouraged because I felt like I’ve been doing a really good job with the operations end and this was a slap in the face. 


TLDR: new job misled me to believe my job duties would be more management based responsibilities so I can get experience but they hit me with “supporting documents” to tell me I should focus more on keeping the office clean. 

Edit to add: they had 3/4 other candidates interviewing for the position. But the CEO texted me three hours after the interview to asking if I can do full-Time instead of part-time (since I’m taking classes at a community college for business as well. I already have a degree in Biology btw). So when he asked that, it reenforced the idea of what this company can offer for me.  "
Unsure about Unpaid Internship at Unlaunched Startup (could lead to a job?),"I got offered an unpaid internship at a startup by the founder whom I got to know through tutoring his kid. However, I'm  unsure whether this is a legitimate opportunity worth getting involved with, or not.

**Offer:**  
Unpaid internship. After the launch (in a couple months, trying to find investors), would lead to ""part time or full time.""

**Job Description:**  
Data collecting, product testing, maybe email marketing, maybe operations. Basically a generalist I guess. It sounds like there could be a LOT of flexibility depending on my interest, and probably need.

**Concerns:**

1. He's a self-described serial entrepreneur. But he comes from the finance world so he's started advising groups and whatnot, but no ... startups? Does that make sense? And he says he already has one that's paying for itself (can't tell if that means breaking even or profits), but I can't find anything about it online.  
So **unverified, or unverifiable, history of entrepreneurship**.
2. I know that generally ""unpaid internships"" are illegal. If anyone does work to benefit the company they need to get paid. If I take this on, the job description sounds like I should be getting paid.  
Plus, there isn't anyone to learn from which is what interning is about. If I'm figuring things out on my own that's an employee. So I take **problems with both ""unpaid"" and ""internship""**.
3. I don't know how long I'll have to wait until funding then converting to part/full time. Maybe it'll only be a couple months like he said but there's no guarantee. Also, what if I get hired but the offer is too low to accept? I'll have worked free for months with no job at the end. Does that mean I have to discuss my future possible salary *now,* before accepting the internship? **A solid job in the near future is not guaranteed**.
4. Originally I wanted to join a mid-size startup that's in growth stage. I have no special skills (a.k.a. not a software engineer) but that's all the more reasons so I can learn a lot and fast. I'm afraid that if I do this, **couple years later I won't have much to show for** in terms of both specialized skill/career and company recognition (90% of startups fail, after all).

Here are a few reasons why I'm considering it.

* One is that he says there are engineering teams for each company. They may be small but if there's a team I feel like it must be legit. I've also briefly met 2 non-engineers working for him, so that shows there are *real* people working on these (even if they're young & inexperienced).
* He doesn't seem like he's fiscally struggling. He's been regularly paying me for tutoring. His finance side could be floating all of his startups BUT maybe his prior startup really is ""paying for itself"" and his other ventures are working out as well. Obviously he's doing something right even if it weren't his startups.
* I'm interested in startups which is why he gave me this offer in the first place when he found out. It could be a great experience if it goes well. I'm also a grad looking for jobs so just any work that could add to my resume is nice.

&#x200B;

**Options**

I could take it and maybe get a good reference and a line on my resume out of it, while still applying to other things. But in that case, I'd be doing work for free.  
I could take it and wait to get converted to FT and become an early employee of a new startup. In that case I want a guaranteed FT with fair compensation, which I don't know what is. But I don't have enough information to make a comfortable decision.

&#x200B;

I'm going to have a meeting with him next week to discuss more about what I'd be doing, and would like to have some answers by then. Am I worrying myself too much? Or is everything a total red flag? I've no idea.   
I appreciate any advice or insight."
"Job doesn't seem to be panning out, need advice","I was a stay at home mom for 3.5 years before jumping back into the working world, where I took on a Customer Success/Support role at a startup with some decent funding ($20mm raised so far). I have previous experience in Customer Service/Support but I am the first hire at this particular company in the department.

I am finding that my role was hired very preemptively, which is fine, but now that I'm settling in (5 months) I still can't shake that there is something off. We are a technology/SAAS company and everyone else I work with is a developer. We only have a handful of customers at the moment and everything is still being beta tested/developed. I don't have a developer background, so I can't jump in and help with anything really.

I barely talk to my manager, and he keeps rescheduling every 1 on 1 meeting that we've had scheduled. I think I've had 3 1-1s with him in the last 4.5 months, each lasting less than 10 minutes before he has to jump into his next meeting or task. i have mentioned that I feel siloed and isolated from everyone else and he keeps telling me it will change once we have customers onboard. When I do try to engage in conversations with my coworkers (mainly via slack channels), I am ignored like I haven't even said anything. I ask for feedback and it's all positive, I'm doing a 'great job,' but I feel like they are going to realize they are paying me to twiddle my thumbs and cut their losses. I want to do more. I want to feel useful and like I'm contributing. Some days I feel like I'm going crazy. Our VP sits next to me and literally walks into the office in the morning and says hi to the other girl that is in the office when he gets there (it's usually us 3 from 8-9AM) and says nothing to me. Doesn't even acknowledge me.

There are good parts of my job, I'm making really good money for basically doing nothing right now (50k/year) and we have unlimited PTO and a super flexible environment. For example, I'm working from home tomorrow because the weather is shit, and no one cares. I am getting good resume filler. I don't need to work for the financial gain (we lived on my husbands salary for 3.5 years, and managed to pay off almost all of our debts, so everything I make is extra on top of our expenses, and going towards paying extra on my school loans and daycare.)

I have been part of a startup culture before, and know it's not for everyone. But this one seems especially off. Am I overreacting? Should I run? Should I stay put and collect a paycheck? I feel like I am wasting my time right now and not sure how to remedy."
How do I get hired,"I got experience but I want to have another job. This one doesn’t pay much and to get a higher position someone has to die it seems. I tried applying to different places. I hear constantly of people saying “oh I got another job” like what the fuck. Why them, why never me when I work hard and all. How do they get jobs seemingly on a whim, while I can apply to 100+ jobs, and not even a call back. "
Moved to abroad for US owned company. Immediate breach of contract.,"So through an old boss and friend (or so I thought), I recently relocated to take a job in the Balkans for a chemist job of a business owned by US investors. 

I'd met the people a few months prior and they seemed alright. We had a contract that seemed good to go. I was in NZ at the time just skating by and running from medical bills back in the US, so I needed the money. 

That said, as soon as I was on the ground, the contract was immediately breached. The employer (US owner) started paying me in half payments via sketchy US-US acct wire transfers calling them ""loans"" so that he wouldn't have to deal with the tax withholdings as a US citizen. 

A month into it, they had had enough of my trying to follow US tax and local immigration laws, and terminated me without reason into total breach of the contract. Now, I'm stuck in this part of Europe whilr they still owe me money and have no idea what I should be doing about my tax situation? I know I'm an idiot for taking this job but I trusted my friend and old boss and really didn't think they would f*** me this badly right at the start. 

What should I do about the situation on the whole?"

Is this considered abuse at work? Is there anything I can do?,"For the past couple of months when my cofounder and I would not be able to find a solution to a discussion immediately, my cofounder would degrade me for my worth, call me names and shout at me.

Every time I am shouted at, I lapse into a trauma where my body start shaking uncontrollably (I assume this is a body behaviour for fear) for about an hour. We're part of a startup incubator, and I brought it up with my program manager on multiple occasions but the only advice I got was to 'give it time and you'll figure it out'.

So I pushed to take professional coaching, so that my cofounder could learn to control their behaviour. We did this for about a month (individually). When I brought this matter up with the coach, the conversation didn't go anywhere except that different people have different styles of communication.

But recently, I was shouted at again in front of a senior program manager, and afterwards, I was again called names in private.

I don't think I can work with this person anymore. It's been affecting me emotionally and physiologically.

I was wondering if anyone's had a similar experience to this? What advice would you give yourself if you were in my shoes? Any ideas on what options I have to solve this problem?"

Severance package help deciding between 2 options.,"Hello! If this post doesn’t belong here please let me know. 

I was recently laid off from a start up company. They originally offered me 4 weeks pay as a severance package, but I negotiated in some stock options. 

Now they are saying it is too expensive to add in the stock options so I can:

A) take 6 weeks pay instead of 4 weeks but not get any options 

OR 

B) get one week pay but get 2,500 shares included. So I am basically covering the legal fees it takes to write a new contract. 

This was my first job and I was there for a year and 4 months. I am just wondering if anyone else has experience with this or if anyone has a creative argument/knowledge to get both 4 weeks pay and the stock options. Thank you!

Hiring First Startup Employee,"Hey all. First time posting here and hoping to get some direction.  


I am the co-founder of an insurance technology company based in Evanston, IL (smaller city just north of Chicago). Me and the other co-founders have spent nearly 2 years working on this company and are getting ready for our public launch mid March. We've had a lot of success so far pre-launch; we hit our seed round fundraising goals and have all our tech in place for launch. Now we are looking to add our first full time employee in inbound sales.  


We want someone who will be our boots on the ground working side by side with all the co-founders to build a customer base. We also want someone who will eventually transition to senior management  one day and run the entire sales department. I think of this person as being relatively young, highly motivated, and with prior sales experience.  


Any ideas on the best places to hunt for this type of talent? We've posted on indeed, but we've been getting SO many CVs that don't fit the bill. Thanks in advance for any help! Oh and if this sounds like you, and you live locally, please feel free to introduce yourself :-)"

If they ask about it we would be prepared to give it, but we don't have to introduce it to rude customers? I'm honestly not sure if that would fall under discrimination or if that's appropriate.

Best way to get into a new companies rhythm/speed,"So this is for sure a very good problem to have.

I recently started at a new company and they are still in the startup phase. I have experience starting at 3000+ then going down to  500+ employees and now I'm coming in here to a space of only 38. Its weird because they're pacing is a lot... slower than I'm used to. In both of those larger spaces I had the same leader who was a workaholic (work on average 12+ hour days and weekends and would say they were all about work/life balance but would freak if you left at your scheduled time) and I guess I'm just use to juggling several projects at once and always being stressed.

Here projects span out over a lot longer than I'm used to. A project I could finish in a few days through crunching at the larger companies aren't expected to be done until a week or two out. I finish a project then sit here with this extra time and it freaks me out. What are some good ways to get used to this?

how do I get my current job to agree to allow me to work remotely,"A little back story: I currently work for a start up company that has amazing potential to become something great.

We are located in VA and I am in charge if Administration, bringing in employees, sending emails, testing the website and apps, inventory orders, accounting etc. 

My husband and I are in the process of relocating for various reasons, the main ones being that my in laws are extremely overbearing and refuse to allow us to live our lives without constant intervening (we should have known not to move here when both of his brothers and their wives have moved away bc of this) they r supportive but in a very negative ""if you didnt have us you wouldn't have anything"" sort of way and we saw this as the perfect opportunity to get to NC. 

Unfortunately, that would mean leaving my job behind, SO just received his bachelors and has gotten tons of offers in NC. My entire day at work is spent in front of the computer with some filing incorporated. However, the entire administrative dept is set up, organized and run by me. I am certain that I can do my job from anywhere in the world bc all files are saved on a shared drive that we can all view and edit accordingly. 

My question is, how do I convince them that I can do this job from anywhere?? I mentioned that we were considering moving and they looked very torn about it. Is there a way for me to show that this could be a good option and a perfectly capable one?? I've worked from home before but only as a cal center agent. I have a work phone so I will still be able to speak to customers and drivers like I do in the office bc I use my work cell there as well. Any advice I'll appreciate please help!! "

Probation extended because of the time of year only. What to do?,"So I started a new job a few months ago in a start up company that has less than 10 employees. Now I know the environment can be quite different from a longer standing company, but I took the offer. Even though we are allowed an hour lunch, I don't think I've actually had one where I haven't made my food and sat back at my desk to continue working in the past two weeks, before that I would probably only be out for 20 or so minutes before having to come back. 

I had my probation review a couple weeks ago stating that I wasn't living up to the role and not making it my own.

I have nobody to lean on for guidance either as they don't understand my position. 

The boss was going to dismiss me, but with the time of year it is, they have given me a month extension to change things around.

"Resources for ""corporatizing"" my Startup Office","Hey /r/Jobs. 

So I recently started at a small business / startup running the office operations and my boss has been talking more and more about wanting to implement processes/procedures to ease our transition from a small startup-style, two-to-three person passion project to a more organized, efficient operation that can scale upward and not miss a beat. 

I've always worked for small businesses that have prized their ability to adapt and change on the fly, and I don't want to lose that adaptability. However, we need a solid foundation in place and a structure to grow into and expand beyond and I'm a little intimidated being the boots-on-the-ground point person to execute my CEO's vision.

Potential Job with a Startup at Series C funding,"Hello, there's a chance I land a job with a startup that has gone through their Series C funding (in the Bay Area). I have been work for Mid/High Cap companies my entire career so I'm not familiar with working for a startup. I was told that lower salary is expected in exchange for potential future equity in case the company goes IPO. 

I had received an offer letter before that gave me 25k stocks (RSU) but turned it down (later the company was bought at U$2/stock). At that time I was offered a slight increase compared to my base salary then, but I was relocating from a place where salary range is lower than the Bay Area.

My questions are:

1. How much roughly (in percentage) lower on base salary do startups usually pay compared to established, usually public, company? 
2. This one is probably hard to answer, but just an estimated range, how much usually a startup stock worth when they bought out or goes IPO? I was told the usual range is between U$1 to U$4 per stock (in the Bay Area at least).
3. If I end up getting an offer, what else should I expect differently from an offer from a more established company?

Should I avoid working at startups?,https://medium.com/@jainilvachhani/dark-sides-of-working-at-a-tech-startup-8bb3c4a65e32
Should I join a startup as intern or stay at my current corporate job while finishing school?,"Hello reddit,
Need some help regarding my career situation. Some background info:
22M in Canada, in university for Business Degree, has one more year left (8 courses)
Current job: Part time contractor at one of the biggest oil and gas company in Calgary, Canada, making about 50k CAD a year, doing it while in school, I used to intern here and that's why I have this nice gig. I have a lot of coop experiences at big oil companies. Love my coworkers, and my boss, he is the most caring and chill manager I've had so far. I pretty much can stay part time until I graduate and very confident that I will receive a full time offer from this company (already verbally confirmed from my boss) making about 80k CAD right after graduating. The work itself isn't too exciting (IT Application support) but its not demanding at all, I prob only work half of the time and chill for the rest. 
Potentially I have an offer from a startup in San Francisco coming up for this summer, 4-8 months term. They just raised their series A and prob doing their series B this year. I believe in their mission and business model. I will be helping out with their business team doing project management and operation roles. The pay isn't great, like 15 US a hour. They are looking to double their headcount this year and I do think I have a good chance to stay full time after internship. I always wanted to work at a startup because I believe I can learn a lot there vs at a big company since they will be growing really fast. And I love SF as a city, so much more things to do than Calgary. 
My problem: SF is a really expensive city to live in vs where I am now, I am looking at double the cost of living. And 50% pay cut vs what I make now. So every month I am there I will need to put in my own saving while working at that startup. And if I were to leave my corporate job now I doubt I will be able to get it back after. Also there is a chance of full time at the startup which means I wont finish my undergrad degree (1 year left). Talked to my family and friends about it, all of my friends support me to go but my family not so much. They think I should finish school and my job is really good so I should stay at this oil company. But my argument is that if the startup fail I can always come back to school and finish up (you can take 10 years max to finish your degree), and the learning experience/opportunity I will have at that startup is very valuable, I see it as my ticket into the tech industry. 
What would you guys do in this situation? Stay corporate or take a bet at a startup?"
Leaving the corporate rat race behind: who has left the job market to start a business and succeeded?,"So my wife and I were doing our finances over the holiday period, and thankfully we are doing well and on the right track. As part of our financial independence and retirement strategy we want to move away from corporate jobs and into something that we can call “our own”. 

Business wise, we consider that there is a certain level of investment required, and that we have the finances and capital enough to loan against and maybe buy something freehold with a business.

So I just wanted to ask, has anyone left the traditional work force to start a business? What were your reasons? How did it go? 

I’m well aware of the statistics that show that a large number of businesses fail, and probably a large number barely make enough money to be profitable. I even remember reading somewhere about someone who started their own business and found they worked double the hours of their employees for half of what they paid their employees!

Parents not reacting positively for joining in startup,"I am currently pursuing B.Tech in the final year of my university and recently got an offer from a service based company, XYZ. Yesterday I got a call from a startup company, ABC. ABC took an interview and decided that first I would be doing an internship in the company then based on my work I will get a full time offer. My parents are sceptical about joining this startup for full time work and want me to join XYZ, where I will not be happy to work and learn nothing. How can I convince my parents that I don't want to work in XYZ but will get to learn many things while working in ABC?"
"I work for a startup that is going to fail, but enjoy it. When should I get out?","This is the first time I've worked at a startup. Assume I'm young and can take financial and temporal risks.

I've worked for a well-funded startup company (30-40 people) for about a year. We work on an incredibly ambitious, technically challenging hardware problem. When I interviewed, it was apparent that there were major, major unsolved problems (part of the reason I was brought in), and while they obviously did not reveal the full magnitude of the problems at the time (partially because they didn't know), I thought I was making a ~50/50 bet on joining a company with a viable concept.

After a lot of hard work and the discovery of problems we couldn't have known (we're really pushing the limits of physics in some respects, and it pushed back... if only we could change the speed of light a bit!), it is apparent that my bet was ""correct"", but I landed on the wrong side of it. I'm comfortable with my choice, but I'm not sure what to think now. We have runway for another ~13 months, and it's possible we'll get more money to keep trying. I just think the probability of success in an investor-friendly timeframe has dropped to maybe 1%- we'd need a miracle. However, I love my co workers, the work itself is still interesting, and I'm paid only marginally less than what I would get at large companies.

I'm interested in knowing how the death of a startup like this might play out- I have no experience with this, and I can't exactly ask my co-workers without bumming them the hell out. Right now, the leadership is doing a good job keeping morale reasonably high, and no one is completely panicking. A fair number don't really realize that we're kinda screwed. I could imagine, though, that things could change in a hurry rather quickly. I do think that in the event we failed, both our leaders and potentially board/investors would assist in helping employees get other jobs. I have in my head a calm wind-down, where people recognize the end coming and everyone tries to help out everyone else... but there aren't THAT many related positions in our area. Any advice?"
Startup receives funding in couple of months after struggling for a long time. What are the things I should take care as an employee before it happens?,"I joined the startup a year ago, was paid the promised amount of money for first three months.  Things fell apart from then, the company ran out of money and then I was paid the travel allowance and sometimes was paid nothing, many co-workers left. I and few others decided to stick around as I was doing something I enjoyed. The co-founders were upfront about the whole situation and seeing their confidence I stuck around even more than I was comfortable with. 
There were no legal binding contracts when I joined, ""we shook on it"". But things are about to change when the funding scene happens. What are the documents legal or otherwise I should take care of? Anything else that I should take care? This is my first legitimate gig, will like guidance as much as possible.

P.S. first time poster, forgive me if I didn't follow any rules. Thanks"
"I start my first job on the 16th, and truthfully, I'm scared as all hell.","This is going to be my first ever 9-5 (I did under the table work with my dad and also my grandpa, but neither job included working with food and very many people) and while I'm ready for it, just everything in me right now is freaking the hell out.

Small side business on-top of School,"As I am at high school (currently in the last year) I've been looking to get a side job to help make some extra money. I am interested in computers and am applying for a course in computer science but I only have a shitty computer functional skills qualification (pretty much just showing you can copy  and paste) because that's all my school offers.
I'm experienced with computer software and find stuff like this easy. I was recommended to do something like this after I removed a virus from my friends parents computer. They got a quote from pc world for £60 but didn't send it in to be fixed.

My idea is to start a side business to install programmes, software and remove thinga like viruses. Anything to do with software. Nothing to do with hardware or fixing broken parts only software. I was wondering if this is a good idea and how I might start something like this?"

Is this a good way to reach out to startups in my area?,"I’ve been applying to companies online and have gotten a few interviews here and there but no offers.

Got my first engineering job any advice?,"So basically I graduated few months ago and landed my very first job as an MEP inspector which I know nothing in terms of technical knowledge. First day was cool, getting to know the people setting up my station and what not. But I am skeptical about what's next?
  
So basically I know nothing, how should I approach it? What should I do to maximize my learning ? What type of questions should I ask the engineers, will they be bothered if I ask a lot?
  
I hear from my friends that the very first weeks they were given catalogues to read, project documents to read but is this the right way?
  
I am really afraid, appreciate any advice. Cheers"
Torn about leaving a job for another. Better pay vs networking opportunities,"Three months ago I joined a company that I absolutely despise and draining for the amount they pay me vs the work I'm loaded with. I've been thinking of quitting, although only if I get a job offer so I can sustain myself. 

For a few months now I've been working on a project that I'm really passionate about. Passionate to the point where I work on it on nights and weekends, almost immediately after I get home from work. The project is going really well, I've been doing small tests to show validation and potential, and so far it's been a tremendous success, with those in the tests recruiting others to be in the test as well. 

Unfortunately due to the job work on the project is now almost stopped in its tracks. Due to the amount of work and how its drained me, I barely have the energy to work on it anymore. The weekend now composes of a day and a half of me resting and/or being depressed and unmotivated with half a day working in a slower capacity. 

Due to this I now get angry and frustrated with myself, even my partner has noticed the difference in me before joining vs after I got the job. 

So I've been applying for different jobs and I got an offer yesterday for a 3-6 month contract that pays almost double the current gig, which starts next Friday. (Plus it's something I think I'd enjoy)

You'd think it's easy, I quit and join the new job right? Well, the agency I work for has some very valuable people for networking and such, one such person I've been talking to about my project and they love it so much that they want to help me with pitching and networking. Yesterday I talked with a venture capital, who's *really well connected* that works for the firm as a de facto consultant and after having a long conversation about my project and such, she is eager to help me out in any way, perhaps even personally investing when the time is right (I told her I'm not interested in investment at the moment, the project doesn't even have a name yet). 

I'm worried if I quit then it'll burn the bridges I have with them. At the very least I want to build a solid relationship with them so that when I quit they don't hold it against me.

Now I'm torn on what to do, should I join the new gig and be able to build up savings for when I go full time on the project or should I stay to build my network and potentially connect with some very valuable people?

UPDATE:

Thank you everyone f​o​r you all's advice.

Some clarifications though, I work full-time at the agency and the project I'm working on has been on my own time, with the hopes of turning it into a startup. There's no way I'd even dare work on it while in the office,​ if you've ever watched Silicon Valley it's obvious why.

The contract itself is for 3 months (with a possibility for a 3 month extension but I'm not factoring that in any of this) and I have a barista job offer on standby so I can go into that job almost immediately to help significantly reduce my cost of living and live on the savings I'd get from the contract work for a much longer time.

My rationale is that I would get enough savings within the next three months with the contract job, (hopefully) working on the project on nights and weekends, after it finishes I take a part-time position with the cafe as a barista while I work in almost full blast until it's ready for pitching for investment and accelerators.

Funny enough, earlier in the weekend I was thinking of staying in the agency job to help build the relationships with the two people I've been talking about the project to until it's ready enough that I'd leave/they encourage me to go full-time on it. However, for the past three months since taking the full-time job at the agency, I am fully drained both emotionally and mentally by Friday and need at least one day or even the full weekend to recover. 

Today when I got depressed about having to go back to work on tomorrow, I realized that if I stay at the job and things stay the same, with development in a significantly slower pace than before, I talked with other entrepreneur friends and when they told me that networking will be much more impactful when the app is much further along and that there's plenty of networking opportunities out there, the decision was obvious.

So I signed the offer letter and sent it earlier today, which almost immediately lifted my spirits and I've been quite productive since emailing the letter.

I've emailed the upper management of the agency that I want to talk to them tomorrow about transition out of the company and I'm also going to talk to the two people at the company informing them of my decision, with the hopes that they understand and they'd either still want to help me now or later when things are more developed and networking would be more beneficial. 

Here's hoping I made the right decision..."
Late payroll at new startup position,"So, I just started a new position at a startup.  This is my third day on the job and none of the employees were paid on time this week. 

The company has hired over 100 employees in the last few months and they seem to be bored/without work a majority of the time. 

Am I wrong to already want to jump ship due to these red flags? I have never worked for a startup before so not really used to this type of environment. I have savings so I have a little wiggle room to job search. "
Is it against hiring practices to seek young blonde sales representatives?,"So at a meeting, one of the upper-echelon partners who talks to investors said maybe we should hire young, blonde people as sales reps. It made the minority and women sales rep feel uncomfortable and it pissed me off. It's a startup in CA, and I think that is against hiring practices. I don't know if I should say something to anyone or if I should make a big deal out of it? We don't have an official HR person YET, so don't know. 

What can I do to make my co-workers feel they are not in jeopardy? Is there anything I can do?"

How can i get a job editing videos where i can work from home?,"Hi, so there's something i've always been good at. It's editing videos. I have a good computer and decent editing software.


But, i want to market my skills and use them for gain. 


Basically, i want to become kind of a freelance editor, like, someone send me their videos or footage online and i'll edit it together for them. Like, a wedding video or something. Kind of like that.


I'd rather work from home, if possible, (rather then like, an office or something). Because i am somewhat disabled, i have knee problems and limited mobility so i can't really get around very well, i just think it'd be better.


So, my question is, how do i go about doing this? I don't have much ""formal"" training with this, i didn't go to college or anything, but i did learn a lot about editing in high school broadcasting class.


I honestly think i could make a career off this, i love editing videos,

Would Paul Feldman’s bagel business strategy be a possible side hustle for a 20 yr old college student?,"If you've read the book Freakonomics then I'm sure you're familiar with what business I'm talking about. However, if you aren't familiar with Paul Feldman and his bagel business, [here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/06/magazine/what-the-bagel-man-saw.html) an article that talks about it briefly. Basically what Feldman does is buys bagels in the morning, leaves them in various offices with a collection box asking for one dollar per bagel, and comes back later during lunch time to collect the boxes. For anyone that is unfamiliar it might sound crazy, but it was actually a wildly successful business. He was able to quit his full time job and earn more than he ever did just by depending on peoples' honesty to leave money for the bagels. I believe that he still continues his business to this day in Washington.

A few things to note about myself. I just turned 20 years old, in college, have a part-time job, and just looking for side hustles while in school. I was primarily thinking about targeting elementary, middle, and high school faculty in my district with this bagel service. Leave 2 or 3 boxes of bagels and a collection box in each school's faculty lounge (if they allow it).

My concern isn't so much as to whether people will be honest enough in order for the business to be profitable (Feldman showed that honesty didn't hold the business back from being profitable through meticulous data collection), but rather if breaking into this kind of side hustle is viable or not. Will the startup cost outweigh the profits? Will the risk outweigh the profits? Will it be hard finding clients that are willing to do business? Is this just as a side hustle too much?

I know these questions don't have definitive answers, but I'd like to hear other people's opinions on the matter."
What should I do about this situation at my current job?,"Sorry it’s long but I need some advice!!!

So I got hired about two months ago at a hair salon to be the only esthetician and to do facials waxing and lashes. I didn’t have a clients but the owner said do a lot of Facebook and Instagram advertising and things and give out flyers to local businesses and “supposedly” she had a lot of people asking about services saying there was no one in town who does facials or lashes so I would get a lot of people (haven’t gotten that many yet). So now two months later I’m slowly building a clientele I have now 5 clients it’s not much but I’m getting there slowly and I just got one yesterday who wants to book next week for thanksgiving. Also one of the hairstylist who also was an instructor in the past says it takes time to build clients. So today I come in early I have an appointment for someone to get a facial with me. I walk in I was the first one there today and I see a massage table out in the salon area thinking did they get a new table in the spa room or something? Then I get in my room the same table was there so I was like ok whatever maybe it’s the massage lady’s (she’s finishing up soon to retire in January) then I get out of the facial room and then see a girl there doing lashes. Then the owner was like this is so and so (so mad I forgot her name) and I was like oh hi blah blah blah and then I had to leave the salon for the day. Do you think that was rude of the salon owner to do me like that? She never did say in the beginning there were going to be two people doing lashes or two Esthetician’s she said it would just be me only by myself. I just show up today and there she is doing lashes. I wasn’t even told heads up she was going to be working with us or her asking if it’s ok with me or anything for all I know she could be looking for new clients too. This girl could be getting all my lash clients when people call the salon and what if they forget and don’t mention my name and they just want to book for lashes thinking umm the only one there and she gets the appointments instead and I’ll be the one getting no business again. Do you think that was wrong/rude of the salon owner? Should I probably be looking for somewhere else to work where I won’t have to compete doing lashes if that girl also needs new clients? I’m so upset/mad about this! What would you do in this situation?"

How to best identify tech companies in the startup (post funding) phase,"I'm an experienced Director of Sales and Operations.  

After increasing the revenue of my last company by over 700% I never anticipated that I would have been so successful in doing what I do that my CEO would have a mental breakdown and shutter the company - simply due to work overload.  (This was with a Government Contracting company run by a Disabled Veteran. - Guess I should have seen that coming.)

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm damn good at identifying and creating corporate partnerships, and well versed in Government Sales and Contracting.  I'm also highly attracted to new start-up type companies which have a good product/service which could be utilized by the US Government in some capacity. 

&#x200B;

I would like to build an database of funded start-up companies which have either a SaaS software, or a product offering that I could join the team as their Director of Business Development (or similar) while helping to build a Government Sales push within the company.  

&#x200B;

My question is, how the hell do I identify start-up companies that are searching for a West Coast (Nevada) or remote Business Dev role, are funded, and have a well received product or software app?  I've gone through AngelList, VirtualVocations and all the standard job search databases, but those are just for companies who are actively looking for a specific position.  I'm wanting to identify and target startups that may not realize what it is they need yet.

Any advice on this?"

"Undergrad’s last summer: Intern, startup or travel?","Hey Redditors, I’m an undergraduate from Singapore in my penultimate year of study. Next summer will be my last summer in my student life ever and I’m having a dilemma on how to spend that summer.

Here’s the thing tho: I’ve already done 5 internships so far - including the one I’m on now for winter internship at a reputable management consulting firm. I already secured another management consulting internship in Tokyo next summer (which will bring total internships before graduation to 6, or more than 1 year in duration) ...but it’s only one month. 

So I have 2+ months left and I’m wondering if I should try to get another internship, pursue one of my startup ideas (I’ve done preliminary research on these and it just needs to be given time to work on) or just let it all go and go travel and enjoy the last parts of my student life. (Made some money off crypto and I think that can bring me maybe around parts of Asia) maybe get a divemaster license idk

So yeah I’m having the dilemma because interning will give me more career exposure so I can choose better when I actually choose a job, but I also feel the need to cherish whatever’s left of my student youth.

"Startup founder behaves really odd, what would you do?","I came across a startup from a job ad. It fit my background quite well and I applied and connected with the founder for an informational interview. The founder replied and agreed to a time and date. At the time and date, I never got a call or a follow-up message. 

A few days later, I get an InMail message from the founder saying she saw my application and she thinks it's a good fit and asks to schedule an interview. She seems completely oblivious that she had agreed to the previous interview.

So I give her the benefit of the doubt that she's just crazy busy and inattentive and continue as if nothing had happened just to see where things would go. 

The phone interview comes and it seems to go quite well. I was able to pitch her several techniques I would use to solve some of her challenges.

She follows up a with an email containing technical and behavioral essay questions for me to answer. She asks for things that are outside of the scope of the job listing. But I was able to chalk up an answer anyways. 

She ghosted me for nearly a month afterward despite one followup email the day after. 

Today I receive an email from her with almost the exact technical/behavioral questions. She asks me to respond. It's almost like she had a month-long amnesia and got teleported to a month ago. 

I replied that I would appreciate feedback on my answers. She said she never got it and asks me to send it again. 

I didn't respond and about 12hrs later, she replies the answers I sent her a month ago and says she likes my answers and would like to continue with the interview. 

The founder seems pretty legit. Googling her shows she won a recent competition and she did a postdoc at a prestigious institution. Also, I found a news press from 5 days ago saying that her startup just secured another round of funding from a venture fund backed by Gates and Zuckerberg.

So my gut feeling right now as to why she has behaved the way she has is:

1. She's incredibly busy trying to get a startup going and she's lacking on her organizational skills. 
2. She originally found someone more qualified but that fell through so she's trying to pursue me now.

Either way, her communication is atrocious and I'm pretty sure it'd be bad news to work for someone like this.

Right now, I'm thinking about continuing to find out more about the likelihood of bringing a viable product out to the market, how long it would take, and how I could play a part into making that happen and continue from there.

I'm interested in hearing what you guys think."
Job With Flexible Hours For Teens?,"I just turned 16 and I am looking to get a job, the problem is that I need a job with flexible hours (Weekends and maybe Friday) because I have a lot of school work. What would you suggest? And is it better applying online or going to the place itself?"
"Young CPA major career change - thinking about starting a paving company, need practical advice","I'm 29 years old and have been a CPA for the past 6 years, working at the same job for 10 in your typical office setting. The job itself isn't overwhelmingly difficult, nor is it very fulfilling. Although it provides me with great financial security, other factors have been building up that have made me resent the job (I'm sure I'm among many in saying this).


The paving company idea came up with a life long friend who is a heavy machine operator and technician, who also shares the passion for wanting to build something of their own. My CPA background to this point is being viewed as a means to an end, and can give us the business/finance/tax benefit of pricing/costing/financing the business and assets we acquire.


Basically what I'm looking for is some starting points to acquire the hands on ability to pave and gain as much knowledge on the field that I can prior to starting the business. My initial considerations are as follows, along with some other important points to note:


1) Ideally structure my departure from work at end of Summer/18 and in a way so that I can receive unemployment


2) Take heavy machine operators course throughout the Winter/18


3) Work in the industry for a local paving company throughout the 2019 season to try and obtain as much hands on knowledge as I can


4) Come up with business model and acquire appropriate assets in offseason Winter 2019. Basic business to start will be paving/sealing/patching driveways, which would limit our initial capital outlay when compared to more commercial paving equipment/staffing requirements


5) From what I have read so far, the general machinery will consist of a single axel dump truck, 1-2 ton rolling machine, small paving machine (or could we get away with shovels/brooms to start), a hauling trailer and other miscellaneous tools i.e. tamper etc.


6) I have accessible capital of about $130,000. My life long friend also has sufficient capital to finance machinery/other start up costs


I know this is very rough, and obviously so much more consideration has to go into this plan. But at the end of the day, I want to do something outside for a living, I am prepared for gruelling work, and I want to build something for myself. I would appreciate any other advice with respect to the career path in general or how to best prepare/educate myself before starting the business.


Thanks a lot everyone!"

- What forms do I ask for when I get employed and which forms are crucial (e.g P45, P60, Any PAYE forms)?
- Do I instantly declare that I am employed?(If so, who do I declare it to?)
- Do I tell them the exact date I started work and my salary, or do I have to provide a document that shows all those details?
- Any other steps other than employment declaration that I need to know?
- If I terminate employment, do I go back and tell them that I am now currently not employed or do I show documents?

Concise information will be very appreciated "
Web Administrator - Salary Question,"I work for a family owned start up in the Firearms industry in the Midwest United States. It is new, but expanding rapidly and we've been averaging $30k daily in gross sales over the past year and have a staff of around 30 employees.

The owner recently approached me to work in my own department managing our flagship website. Something that he has been doing on the daily and is starting to burn him out. The responsibilities would include working closely with him to develop sales/marketing strategies, categorizing our stock digitally, search engine optimization, revising product descriptions, altering pricing of products, and managing on sale items based on what we have in stock working closely with our receiving manager. 

We're supposed to sit down and discuss a raise with applicable bonuses next week. I'm from Hawaii and haven't lived long in the mainland US. The pay where I came from is adjusted for cost of living allowance, thus I don't have an idea of fair and equitable pay for the new work I am being asked to do. I have a degree in Small Business Management and Entrepreneurship and my professional history is helping to run my own family's construction company along with my own business as a marketing broker for prepress publishing firms. 

What would be a reasonable salary to expect for this type of work?


"
Rough first day and how to bounce back.,"Hey so I started my job today at a startup doing customer support. I initially thought the induction or training would be present, unfortunately I sat quietly struggling, this is my first startup role and first customer support role so I’m struggling on the information overload. I feel like I seriously flopped today, my manager joked about how quiet I was during the day... I’m lacking on my self esteem and don’t know how to bounce back, the company is really  progressive and I’d like to show I’m a worthwhile employee before my probation ends. Help!?"
"I'm working as an engineer for a tiny/fragile startup, it's chill and I like the actual project... am I a tool for ""volunteering"" some hours a week?","My misgiving is I'm not being offered any alternative compensation, EG shares, and the boss is a massive prick (to everyone else and thinks I don't connect the dots). I've got a date in mind wrapping up what will be our first product release, at which point I'm going to leverage employment offers from elsewhere and see what happens.

I'm hourly and until better investments/funding is secured, I'm basically working average of of 5 ""free"" hours a week since my boss keeps making demands like I'm salaried.

My question is: How common is this in engineering and startup companies?

The reason I'm staying is it's literally right next to my parent's place, allowing me to save 800+ per month that would otherwise be rent, and the boss does not give two fucks when it comes to me taking my own ""flexible"" hours or even drinking on the job. It's absurdly chill and casual all around. The reason I took the job was for the experience and title, which I plan on leaving with that when I feel ready to move on."
How to get a student placement in IT,"So I am on a 4-year bachelor's course in Computer Science and I have finished the first 2.5 years, the other half of the 3rd year is a 6+ month placement in industry. So I am required to get a job for 6 months or more before I can continue on to the 4th year.


I have been looking for and applying to jobs for over a year but no luck. First I was told that what I learned in the university was not enough and I did not simply have the knowledge required for the job.


So I decided  to go full-time learning and I spent months working 8-hours a day, just practicing programming. Taking online courses, making my own projects. After that I finally started getting more interview offers and more positive responses during the interviews. I know a lot of things now (for entry-level positions at least) and I often would correctly answer almost all or all questions I would be asked. However, I was already rejected a dream internship twice simply because they would expect me to possibly stay for a full-time junior position after the internship. However I would like to return to the university to at least finish my bachelor's degree.


Now I can't find any positions that would offer the opportunity to return to the university afterwards. I can RARELY find entry level jobs, graduate jobs, junior jobs, or internships. And if I do, they simply want someone who stays for longer.


What am I supposed to do? This has been going on for over a year. I am incredibly frustrated at this point. I can't carry on with the university, I can't get a job. How does one find a work placement without a mental breakdown along the way?"
One of those days. Need to rant.,"(Posted under throwaway account because reasons.)

I got a job at a startup about (6) months ago after the company I worked for previously shut down. Long story, but the job seemed like a good opportunity to help grow the marketing agency, even though my pay was literally cut in half. I was the 2nd employee, so the first few months I spent working with just the founder and myself in the office.

We clicked immediately upon meeting for the first time. We have very similar personalities, and I was inspired by her motivation and vision for the business. Anyway, a major Catch-22 to working for someone so similar to yourself is that you're not *actually* working for yourself - so the autonomy that I cherished in previous positions has all but disappeared. Although I hold a Management level position (pointless because there's no staff to manage).....EVERYTHING has to be approved by the founder. I'm feeling micro-managed.

I find myself disagreeing more and more with decisions the founder is making and the direction she's moving the business. At the same time, this is my 3rd job within 4 years (various reasons) - I've already applied for other positions within my industry and have faced this obstacle.

*I'm feeling stuck.* I should be grateful for this opportunity, and I am, but working for a Type-A control freak clone of yourself just sucks, man. Thanks for reading."
"I recently got hired, did my paper work, but they haven't called me back.","Okay, I got hired by a popular clothing store last Monday.

Moving from start-up CTO to large company,"
I've worked for mostly early stage start-ups in leadership roles and have held had some very fancy sounding titles, including CTO.  Since these were start-ups I'd wear many hats and be responsible for things such as:

-designing and writing software 

-building and deploying virtual servers

-hiring and leading a small team of developers

-reinstalling printer drivers and resetting people's passwords at 2am when they can't get into their e-mail

-helping CEO develop the business plan.  


I'm now interested in leaving the start-up world due to fatigue with the inherent risks and getting a job at a bigger company.  The problem is that CTO is a VERY different role at a large company like google or IBM.  I'm not qualified to hold a job with this title at a large company, nor is it even the career path I'm interesting in heading toward.  I'd like to be hands-on designing and writing software.


I'm worried that applying for those jobs with CTO in my resume could make HR departments immediately toss out the resume fearing that this is a stop-gap job while I look for another C level position.  I also worry it would color me as having more of a business oriented background and career goals when really I have solid software engineering experience and matching degrees.


Does anyone have advice for how best to handle this situation?  Would it make sense to put a different and more descriptive job title on my resume?  Or maybe qualify it as ""Start-up CTO""?"

How to navigate performance reviews at a startup,"**tl;dr: I want to get the most out of a formal performance review at a startup, both in feedback and compensation increase, how do I do that?**

Hello r/jobs, I wanted to get your opinion on formal performance reviews at startups. I've had some exposure to this process at a previous employer, but that employer was much larger (~7000 employees, compared to 20-30) and the review process was significantly more established.

For some background, this is my second job out of school and a little over 3 years into my career. I've been at this startup for roughly 1 year 3 months, and no review or compensation increase has occurred yet. This review coming up is the first formal attempt to do so.

I have a title of ""Lead *something, omitted for privacy* Engineer"", and feedback has generally been informally very positive for my performance. I am wondering how to both prepare for a more formal review, and how to get the most out of it, specifically for gathering as much feedback as possible and approaching it with intelligent questions.

Also, I am in the dark as to what to expect in terms of a compensation/equity increase, and how much I can reasonably fight for.

Any comments and suggestions are appreciated!

"Young CPA major career change - thinking about starting a paving company, need practical advice","I'm 29 years old and have been a CPA for the past 6 years, working at the same job for 10 in your typical office setting. The job itself isn't overwhelmingly difficult, nor is it very fulfilling. Although it provides me with great financial security, other factors have been building up that have made me resent the job (I'm sure I'm among many in saying this). 


The paving company idea came up with a life long friend who is a heavy machine operator and technician, who also shares the passion for wanting to build something of their own. My CPA background to this point is being viewed as a means to an end, and can give us the business/finance/tax benefit of pricing/costing/financing the business and assets we acquire.


Basically what I'm looking for is some starting points to acquire the hands on ability to pave and gain as much knowledge on the field that I can prior to starting the business. My initial considerations are as follows, along with some other important points to note:


1) Ideally structure my departure from work at end of Summer/18 and in a way so that I can receive unemployment 

2) Take heavy machine operators course throughout the Winter/18

3) Work in the industry for a local paving company throughout the 2019 season to try and obtain as much hands on knowledge as I can

4) Come up with business model and acquire appropriate assets in offseason Winter 2019. Basic business to start will be paving/sealing/patching driveways, which would limit our initial capital outlay when compared to more commercial paving equipment/staffing requirements

5) From what I have read so far, the general machinery will consist of a single axel dump truck, 1-2 ton rolling machine, small paving machine (or could we get away with shovels/brooms to start), a hauling trailer and other miscellaneous tools i.e. tamper etc.

6) I have accessible capital of about $130,000. My life long friend also has sufficient capital to finance machinery/other start up costs


I know this is very rough, and obviously so much more consideration has to go into this plan. But at the end of the day, I want to do something outside for a living, I am prepared for gruelling work, and I want to build something for myself. I would appreciate any other advice with respect to the career path in general or how to best prepare/educate myself before starting the business.


Thanks a lot everyone!"
"Recruiter called about role @ ""stealth mode"" startup??","I looked up what stealth mode means (an industry argot that defines a business operating in secret to avoid potential competitors), **but what does this really imply??** It's a startup. Anyone have experiences with this?

My previous job was also at a startup and long story short, I did not have a good time there... So kinda concerning, BUT at the same time, it's a temporary job so perhaps I don't need to worry too much.

I read that it might mean there will be low pay, but the recruiter at the temp agency told me it'll be $20-22, which is reasonable for an entry-level accounting role in silicon valley. However, interesting that a recruiter would give me estimate right off the bat? I don't have much experience with recruiters. "

Startup Salary growth.,"I’m considering leaving my f500 company for what I consider to be a startup (less than 100 employees). Let’s say my current salary is 50k and the startup offers me 50k. 50k is below market value at this job title and for my degree, but it is still considered entry level for this role. 

So my question is, would I experience faster salary growth at the startup or the f500? Assuming I stay there before leaving whichever company for a higher paying job after 2-3 years.


The startup position is a role which I would get a lot more professional and personal growth out of. I think I would enjoy it more. It is difficult for me to accept another job which I know is less than what I should be paid at. "

Does anyone know any way I can earn some cash while using the computer? If this is not the right subreddit to ask then please point me in the right direction."
(Very) Early Stage Startup Questions to Ask?,"I've been job hunting and I'm particularly interested in startups, or at least the startup mentality - I love a small number of coworkers, wearing many hats, taking on a lot of responsibility. I've been at my first professional job for a long time. It's at a small company, ~25 employees, but well-established and profitable. However, the environment is growing increasingly toxic and I find myself feeling smothered and miserable. The feeling is shared among my coworkers.

I recently applied to another job and was surprised when the poster quickly responded back saying they were impressed with my background. In speaking with them for the phone interview, they mentioned that they were a startup that had just received funding and were in the ""building-out"" stage, with a particular need for my position. If I understood correctly, I would be employee #3-4. I think the idea/product has been implemented and has been in use since ~2008(?), but the company was only put together at the beginning of this year and the founder has basically been doing all of this stuff on his own since then. I should note this startup isn't in cutthroat SF, though it is a software company (nothing like 'the next Facebook' or anything).

I'm *really* eager for a change, and I'm interested in the responsibilities I would have at this company (building out a team, setting foundational processes, etc.), but they are aggressively hiring and looking for someone to start as soon as possible. This has gone from application to final decision in 2 weeks. I feel pressured in that if I ask for additional days to consider, they will go with someone else, which is making me anxious/stressed and wondering if they're looking for the *best* person or the *first* person. (Unsure if this is my anxiety speaking, or the truth.)

So I've been doing research, and I know ultimately this comes down to a risk/reward thing, but I was wondering a few things (I am meeting the CEO for a lunch interview this week):

- What questions would you bring up specifically for a startup that's this early in its life cycle? I've done some research and have a few questions to ask - runway, burn rate - but are there other metrics I need to know? (I'm not too familiar with startup and business terms.) This company is either too new or too below-the-radar for me to find any solid funding information online, although they do have a high retention rate and a decent number of clients. This company has a limited # of competitors, but this company seems to have a more comprehensive/appealing product for the market.

- Is it appropriate to ask about payment? They have indicated that they are looking to make a decision this week, so I'm presumably a top candidate given that this will be my third interview (and both other interviews were very positive, hints of moving forward with me). Essentially, I just want to be sure that I will get a consistent paycheck, at least for the short term as the company is built out, but feel awkward asking about this, even though it's important information and I feel like the company should respect this kind of question. (I am still young and still building out my savings.)

- Is there any other advice for joining a startup that's in such an early stage? I know to expect long hours, doing a lot of business-y things, but am particularly interested to hear of other peoples' experiences. I know there's a significant risk, and I'm tempted to take it since it sounds like it would be a great experience, potentially amazing personal + professional growth, kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, etc., but also I'm usually interested in somewhat established startups, not ones that are literally just getting off the ground.

- Everyone is different, but I'm curious to know - if you were offered a job as a founding member of a startup, would you take it, or would you pass for something more established?

Ultimately a lot will come from meeting the CEO in person this week in terms of how I gauge his personality and what I learn about the company, but I want to be as prepared for this in advance as possible since I will likely need to make a decision if offered ASAP, and I'm struggling to find out exactly how much is appropriate to ask prior to being hired, though I want to make the most informed choice possible. (This may all be moot if they go with someone else, but it's good to know in case I run across something again, and so far the job sounds really promising in my favor!)

Your thoughts are appreciated! I know it comes down to me but I'm looking for as many opinions and unbiased viewpoints as I possibly can. :)"

I Am At A Crossroads - What Can I Start On My Own?,"So I work in a big industry as a programmer and have a degree in mathematics. I have worked in corporate for years in various roles - all technical.   

&nbsp;

However, technical matters are not my only strength as many may be inclined to conclude. I also have good interpersonal skills and enjoy reading and writing. In fact, prior to graduating college, I excelled as a server at a restaurant and always made the best tips among my contemporaries - I was good at sales. 

&nbsp; 

But I've hit a ceiling financially in my career in corporate, and I no longer wish to be capped by the corporate structure. I never really wished for it, to be honest. If someone had told me 10 years ago I was on a path to be ultimately capped at such a young age, I would have never continued on this road.  

&nbsp; 

Quite honestly, I feel like I'm on the easiest path to a hard life. Of course, I could keep my job for the foreseeable future - I work on millions of dollars in business and outperform my peers at every juncture.  

&nbsp; 

But I know I will never make enough to accomplish some of the primary goals I have - to fix up my old house, to have my wife work less, and to actually afford a vacation per year (I have a huge bank of vacation days each year, and the only vacation I can really afford is the one where I buy plane tickets to visit my elderly parents at their vacation home - it's not a real vacation).  

&nbsp; 

I am considering roles/industries such as public adjusting, corporate real estate, insurance, or perhaps opening a small software development company/consulting firm. But I am not sure these should be all the career opportunities I should be considering. 

&nbsp;  

Can you all shed some light on some potential career opportunities I could perhaps start on my own with my background and skill set? Consider that I could afford reasonable start up costs (ex: buying a McDonald's franchise is unreasonable; renting an office space is reasonable) and am open to acquiring additional skills/certifications/licenses. I am not open to professions that have a clear cap on potential earnings. I'm also disinclined to go back to college. And working for others for an extended period of time (beyond 2 years) is also undesirable.  

&nbsp; 

I really appreciate your thoughts in advance.

[UK] Asked to suggest my own contract requirements for start-up role. Thoughts? Ideas? [XPost from /r/UKjobs],"I've been in discussions with a small start-up over the past few weeks and have been made a ""formal"" offer in the form of an email, including the salary offer. As you might expect, the role (a software development role) and responsibilities aren't very well defined since the project roadmap is prone to change. What I found most odd though is that I haven't been given a contract to look through, but rather have been asked to send them a list of ""requirements"" I'd like to be included.

This struck me as odd at first, but I figured this made some sense since they don't have anyone handling HR on their end. I've decided to look at this as an opportunity to include any and all (reasonable) terms of employment that might be worth considering.

Firstly, is there any standard list of terms which **should/must** be included? and, Secondly what terms would you include?
One that comes to mind would be overtime work, specifically: what constitutes overtime work, how is it requested/approved and what would the pay rate be. Is this a standard thing to include in contracts? I've been bitten by this before but never saw a proper way to handle it.

Any other ideas or things to look out for? Perhaps from personal experiences?"
Pressured to sign contract extension (no benefits) instead of promised new contract. Need advice/opinion,"Hi,


this is a throwaway account due to the fact that my colleagues are heavily using reddit as well.


First of all: I hope this is the right space for this topic and additionally, I currently work in Sweden (originally, I'm from another country). So nevertheless, I still hope for some advice (probably not legal advice due to different laws and so on).


Short intro: I am working for a start-up as an Android developer and I just turned 27. This is not my first job and when I started, I was offered an one-year-contract. It's been a really rough but successful year not only for the company but also for myself. During a feedback meeting a couple of weeks ago (which was also regarding further steps for a new contract) I was overwhelmed by the positivity. My supervisor said that he asked several people in the start-up and continued that 'everybody is really happy to work with' me and 'feeling really confident about' me, and so on, you get the point. Bunch of positive stuff. Nothing negative. When we talked about further steps he said that he promised to give me 'without a doubt' a permanent contract and a raise. (This was actually already mentioned 2 months before that meeting).


(Fyi, in our start-up everybody knows about the salaries of the others and I figured out that I am the lowest payed employee in the engineering part... the next person above me receives around 20,000 USD/year more than me). Of course I should be happy that I have a job and so on. But actually, I don't really earn a lot. I still live in a shared flat and try to save money wherever I can. I actually live like back in university.


Back to the topic: Days after the feedback meeting, my supervisor informed me that plans have changed, also due to the finance department and HR: 
- contract extension for another year 
- same salary 
- no benefits, no bonus, nada, nothing. (Well, apparently it's easier to fire me I figured out while I was reading the info regarding the contract extension.)


I was actually quite shocked and still am. My supervisor then promised me, after I received the contract extension, that I will receive a permanent contract and a raise in a couple of months. Probably by the end of May.


I had a bunch of sleepless nights during the past couple of weeks. I love working for this start-up, I really like my colleagues (there is not a single one I dislike and I am being completely honest here) and I see potential in our product. But right now I don't know what to think. I actually planned this year to move out of the shared flat and find a nice place with my girlfriend, but this won't be possible under such conditions. Also it is quite hard to find a decent place to live at if you don't have a permanent working contract. (90% of the landlords in this area will always take people with a permanent work contract - makes of course sense).


I gave everything during the last year for this start-up. So much stress, unpayed overtime, unpayed work time during weekends, 'work hard & don't party' and also put my health at risk at one point. I feel disappointed in the start-up and partially in my supervisor, because he promised things that he obviously can't keep. And now I feel unsure about accepting the contract extension and wait for a couple of months until I get the, again promised, permanent contract with the raise.
By the way, my contract ends by the end of February, until then I have time to sign the contract extension.


Does anyone of you had similar experience? And if so, how did you handle it or in general, how would you move forward in such a situation?


Thanks so much in advance.


(I hope nobody gets me wrong here, I am really happy to have a steady income. I just have the feeling that my work is not being appreciated, even though there has only been positive feedback).


TL;DR: Supervisor promised 'awesome' contract several times, just made another promise that I will get that 'awesome' contract in a couple of months, instead I get another contract without a raise for a year, feeling 'utilized', not quite sure how to continue."
I'm getting into a soon-to-be startup. I'm worried about several things and I thought that you might be able to help me in figuring out what I should do.,"Hello r/jobs, 



Before getting started, I need to point out two things : I am not a native speaker so I apologize in advance for the typos I'm going to make and if you could highlight them it would be very kind of you. The second thing is that I don't know if my partners are on Reddit so I won't be really precise about what we will be working on.



That being said, here we go. I[20/M] am a first year european art student and a couple months ago I met a man at a seminar in a prestigious engineering school. We'll call him Tom. Tom is a PhD student, he is about to finish his paper in a few weeks. His thesis, and his work, are related to a new kind of musical instrument. He has been working on it for three years and a half and is now looking into creating a startup. He is currently looking for money and for partners to work with him.

I'm one of the partners he found. But I'm definitely the least experienced one. The others are another PhD student (in a world class engineering school) who will be working on marketing and help in engineering and the last one is a designer/art gallery director.
He has also found money. Some big players believe in the projects and wants to finance it up to 200k€. The final product will be sold between 5k and 10k€.



I have two concerns. First, I have the impression that Tom is overestimating my skills. My task is going to be a lot of programming (I knew what I was getting into though, I know some stuffs in programming but this is clearly next level for me. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would be a 4 or maybe a 5 in programming skills) to design the UX/visual feedback of the instrument. I don't know if I will be able to meet his demands, since the final product needs to look perfectly clean and professional. 

The other concern is about a totally different thing... *Why me ?* I mean, I get along with him very well, we have the same centers of interest (sound, programming and art) but there is an enormous gap between my experience and his. Tom ""hired"" me before even getting to know me. At the end of the seminar I was practically in the team already. At the beginning, I think it was because we could get a scholarship with the partnership our schools have, but it didn't work out very well and as I said, he has found money elsewhere. Today, the both of us have been working on a brainstorming and it was really great. He genuinely seems to be a good guy but I can't stop wondering why he chose me instead of a more experienced guy. 

I saw *Jobs* (the movie) the other day, and maybe I'm overreacting but I feel like this could be about money. Since I'm younger and less experienced, would it be a reason to scam me (the word scam sounds a bit strong but I don't know any other word which could do it) ? If you don't know the story, when he got rich, Steve Jobs didn't give any money to a teenager (and others) who was helping them out at the beginning, because he was ""just a kid"". Yes I know, I'm definitely thinking about this too much.



To be honest, I find this project really cool and interesting. It could really become the next big thing in the world of music and I'm proud to be a part of this adventure - it might not feel that way when you're reading me, but I'm still down to earth and I know it could fail/end at any time - . But I don't know if I'll meet everybody's expectations and it bothers quite a bit. Should I be careful about something ? Share my thoughts with Tom ? Any opinion or advice will be appreciated.



TL;DR : I'm a first year student getting into a startup with people a lot more experienced. Don't know what to think about this.

EDIT : A typo, and several phrasings."

Here's my situation: I'm broke and need a source of income (aka a full-time job).  However, working on the start-up company drains all of my energy and time and stresses me out significantly, making it really difficult to make any significant progress in the job hunt.

Should I just quit the start-up now and dedicate my time fully on the job hunt? "
How can I move into social media working for a web dev company?,"I'm mostly placed in sales, inside phone sales. While it's great and I get to talk to numerous businesses who are already fine with their sites, I can't just do this all the time. 

They've asked me for ""ideas"" on what to do to improve their social media. They are quite a specialized web service company, and the majority of their clients are in construction and firms. The chill college gent coworker seems like he's got everything on his hands and wouldn't necessarily want help, it could be that taking some work off his plate can give him some down time which will be boring since our manager is quite strict. 

This is just my hunch as it took him very quick to show me what he does: copy and paste from a built-in sheet, read a blog and copy a part of it to re-post. Make sure to use a picture, rinse and repeat. The manager and him were very keen on asking me: ""so if you have any ideas for improving the social media, let us know"".

I don't think they trust me enough with their social media, otherwise they would have personally gave me a role or a page to manage. How can I give them something that can actually give me another job? It would be neat to have a side-thing to do other than sales. As a casual social media user, who also happen to take multiple relative courses (regarding to social media) I have some ideas... Advice would be welcome...

1. Be their ""graphic editor"", I know AI and both of them do not. Basically, what I tried to do with small businesses as a freelancer was re-design their banners every now and then to fit the season, or even include deals as in writing 50% off on the top right of the banner

2. Be an auditor, I can search for irrelevant social media names/pages that they do not have a reach of (I actually don't want to do this) and report after, then what happens when I complete all?

3. A poll creator, basically have my set schedule on when to post a poll to ask followers, it's some form of engagement right? I could be ""okay here is my poll, can you paste this code to their page please""?

Yes, it's the typical position in where he just copies and pastes and automates. I don't think the introduction to Hootsuite would fly as the main boss wouldn't want to spend extra, he mentioned to me of Followerwonk but I know these types of services cost a subscription and yes, I'd like the idea of introducing this once I insert myself as someone who ""can be useful"" in terms of social media. I need to write the two an email soon, but I've already wrote what I know about social media to the manager, after a couple of days, she introduced me to the social media writer guy.

Lastly, It's a little uncanny that they're just asking me for ""ideas"" but I think the work is already cut out for one person, but what do they mean by ""improving""? I almost want to say that they were reluctant on introducing me a new job. I'd very much like to at least have something else to do, the boss has promised me to expand into social media, didn't actually expect that I'd be asked for ""ideas to improve"" if I haven't even gotten the chance to participate in their automation. At the same time, I'm still unskilled as I have no experience in social media, I'm just a sales clerk but would love to expand.

Any advice? Has anyone experienced something similar working with a small company?"

Managers: How long until you fire entry-level new hires for underperforming?,"I have no reason to believe I’m in danger of getting fired, partially because I’ve only received neutral feedback on my work, partially because they’ve been trying to fill that role for a while, it’s only my second week, and because I was recruited as opposed to applying. On the other hand, I know myself to be someone who needs to improve in attention to detail. Because I’m relatively new, I’ve been given leniency but obviously that can’t continue forever. I’ve been working on attention to detail but I’ve only seen slow improvements. So, managers, if someone makes mistakes as a new hire, how long until you fire them?"
How to dress for a drug test?,"It's at an agency for a factory job packing dog food (yeah it's lame but the pay is decent). It's super hot out so shorts are really tempting but even I can see that that's not a great idea. I've never done a drug test and I'm really nervous, anxiety is getting the best of me. All my shoes are pretty worn down too."
New type of policing might mean new types of police jobs?,"I thought I would ask if anyone else thinks police departments might, in the future, hire officers at different levels of training for different levels of service.  Not every call requires officers with guns to show up.  Bank robberies, shootings, gang related calls, yes the officers with guns need to go.  But, medical emergencies, auto accidents, truancy, health and welfare checks do not require an armed response. 

Maybe there are opportunities with police and sheriff departments for people with different skill sets and training."
Started a new job a month ago and underperforming,"I am 28 and started a new job a month ago and i am really underperforming. The job is a big step up for me and i am not being given a lot of guidance. I am supposed to figure everything out on my own. I  really think i will not pass probation. I also have severe anxiety so this makes it  much more difficult at my new job 

Anyhow, what advice can you give me? I already think i will get fired. I am not really contributing anything and really scared of people getting mad at me."
"I'm applying for a job what says I need ""good IT skills, including Microsoft programs"", what Microsoft programs should I need to know?","its a call centre job, does anyone know what IT skills I should freshen up on for this job? And how should I go about doing it?"
Lack of Training is Making Me Feel Inadequate,"I’ve been at my job for a year and a half now, and I work very closely with my supervisor.  She’s amazing, _however_, she tends to hoard work instead of delegating the tasks that I’m supposed to be doing in the first place, and she’s put off training me on over half of the things she said she would since I started working there.

I know that poor training is practically the norm nowadays, and while I know that it’s not my fault that I’m not being trained or taught to do a lot of things, I can’t help but feel completely inadequate and embarrassed when our coworkers ask me questions or expect me to do things that I have no knowledge in because _I was never taught_.

It’s been a bit more difficult during this COVID situation, because my supervisor is at home with her kids and I’m expected to run the office all by myself.  I don’t do a terrible job at all;  I’m definitely capable of running the office alone and I actually enjoy it, but it’s difficult when I’m expected to take care of things that I received no training for.

There’s a lot of things that I’ve taught myself how to do, and a lot of technical issues that I’ve fixed by myself because our IT people are usually too busy to assist me (which is also frustrating), so I know I’m not completely helpless.  And I would LOVE more responsibilities, but I can’t take them on because she would rather do things herself than teach me, so I feel like my hands are tied.  What is the saying:  between a rock and a hard place?

It really eats away at my motivation.  I honestly wonder most of the time why they even have me there, because I have periods where I have nothing to do while my supervisor is drowning in work.  I have to remind her to delegate tasks to me, but because there’s so much I haven’t been trained to do, she can only give me so much work before I’m left with nothing to do again.

How can I get over feeling inadequate, or like a waste of space and money because I’m not being used to my full potential, so to speak?"
Am I going to make it in the real world? I keep getting told I'm too slow wherever I go. I got fired from my last job.,"I'm currently almost 24 years old, and in my senior year of college. I am studying to become a Forensic Biologist. However, it seems that I am slower than the average person during both work and school. I get extended time on tests, because of my Asperger syndrome, and Generalized Anxiety disorder. Without it, I'd fail college.

I got my first job when I was 16 washing dishes (2012). On my first day, I felt excruciating back pain. The pain was so intense, that it slowed me down tremendously, and it caused me to get agitated. Because my Autism was more debilitating back then, I wasn't able to properly communicate exactly how much pain I was in. I got a call from my boss telling me not to come back again. I did not attempt to convince him otherwise.

At my second job at Mcdonald's (early 2014-2016), I was initially too slow. When I got assigned breakfast duties for the first time, I initially got sent home twice for being too slow (they told me it was because of high labor). I suspected there was something wrong, and talked to the managers. I eventually did pick up the pace, and I worked there for 2 years. I had to quit, because my mental health got out of control.

At my second job, as a busser a nursing home (2017-2019), I almost got fired, because I got worked up very easily. This is because I was paranoid from my near-firing at Mcdonald's. Two months later, I decided that I wasn't going to care about my work speed. I ended up becoming a very valuable employee. I worked there for 18 months. I left, because I graduated Community College.

I got a job at KFC last summer, but I quit after only 25 days. It was horrifically understaffed, and I was insecure about my speed again. The manager was also a toxic person who didn't know how to run a business. The other employees were also very unprofessional.

Last December, I got a job as a cashier at Speedway. During the summer I had been put on Immediate Release Seroquel to help me sleep. However, all it did was make groggy during the day. I warned my boss on the first day that if I was too tired, I could get off the medicine. I was fired after two days, because my grogginess made me take too long to complete the computer assessments. When she made the decision to fire me, I had not yet interacted with a single customer. She also gave me no hint whatsoever that there was anything wrong with my performance.

This semester, I got reprimanded for taking too long to complete a lab in Organic Chemistry.

Will life as a Forensic Biologist be impossible for me?"

Relearning Skills Help,Hi for some background I recently graduated from college. My major was Web Design and Interactive Media and I minored in Digital Marketing.

I wanted to know some tips to basically reteach myself social media marketing. Where should I start? If anyone is in the business I would love to hear from you!

Started new job one month ago - scared of getting fired,"So i started a new job one month ago. I am 28 and studied engineering. To give some background since graduating in 2015 i worked at one company for 4 years. Then laat october i switched to a new company and i hated my new role so i quit without nothing lined up. I quit after 3 months in january.

Recently got hired at another comoany and its been one month already. Its a manager position although i do not have any direct reports. However, you need a lot of communication and presebtation skills which i dont have. I had social anxiety my whole life and i stutter a bit when i get nervous or when i dont know what i am talking about.

Anyhow, i feel my coworkers think i am stupid for my poor communication skills and i also do not understand very well what i need to do. And i dont know who to ask for help. My boss is always very ambigous.

this new job is huge challenge for me and really scared i will not pass probation. I am already falling behind and my communication skills are really hindering me. When people explain things to me i am really slow to understand and process them so its almost like a waste of time. Same with talking, it takes me a while to figure out what to say and what to ask sk theres a ton of awkward silences in some meetings


Any advice?"
Got a job but the road to it feels bizarre...,"me (28) is graduating in October this year in business/IT related studies and since dec. 2019 i was trying to land a job to have some safety and enough time to search. So basically i get rejections or and no answers until March.

Thats when the pandemic hit and i reapplied to some companies...

First one rejected my initial application but offered me 2 jobs based my CV and they were excited to get to know me and scheduled an interview.

3 Days later another company calls me for a traineeposition and schedules to get to know me.

First company both interviews went well and i shall deside within a week or two and tell them if im interested.

Second company i was late for the interview, they asked me some basic questions and some i call it ""HR-questions"". 

Got the offer to be a Trainee the next day... and i took it after a week :)

Anyway does anyone of you have experience with Traineeprogramms? How was it? Do i have to prepare?"

Not enough training? Going in blind (sorta),"Not enough training? Going in blind (sorta)

Today I start my official first day as a “cashier” at this small retail store. It’s a fairly brand new one for that matter and I legitimately didn’t get as much training running the front end of the store as I hoped. My first few days consisted of us new employees opening boxes and placing merchandise in the correct slots, watched a couple basic (yet common sense) videos of how to approach customers and what not. A couple videos about the new policies regarding safety due to the on going Covid pandemic. On the final day/ pre opening of the store, we got a super brief rundown of what they expect us to do up in front. They told us how the new self checkout system works, how to return items, how to fix mistakes, remove items.. etc.. They also told us that we must keep track of how many people are in the store at a giving time and all this other important information. All of this new info was literally dumped on us new guys without anything else to go by, no scenarios, no hands on training, nothing! Just 30 minutes, or less of the manager explaining to us what’s going to happen.. this has been the most barebones training I’ve ever received! Do they really expect us not to mess up somewhere ? Have y’all ever went into your job blind with little to no training? If so, how do you survive the first couple of days?"
Started new job 2 weeks ago - barely any training - need help,"So i started a new job 2 weeks ago  and really so far the training has been veey poor. They pretty much expect me to figure out everything on my own. I was already supposed to finish a little project for today and couldnt because there ie so much to do and really struggling. Its a very project based analytical role  Sometimes i ask my boss on certain things and he doesnt know either, he redirects me to someone else. They gave a bunch of really big excel files and pretty much trying to figure out everything on my own.

Anyhow, last job i had i quit after 3 months without a new one lined up because really hating what i was doing. I do not want to go through that again.

Any tips? Really worried i will get fired. The workload is also insane. Getting sick and tired of companies to providing adequate training."
New Job That Looked Like Heaven Is Starting To Feel Like Hell,"I joined a company just as our country (South Africa) was going into lockdown. I was very excited coming from a small company to a big international company. I even got a laptop to work from home (old company only had desktop PCs). 

My manager told me that I was to do work that didn't require using their specific system (ie just use Excel , Word etc) for now then when we're all back at work I'd get training on the system.

Fast forward to this week and one of the people I report to sends me work that's got a deadline for next week and it requires knowledge of their system. My other supervisor assigned someone to ""show me the ropes"" literally yesterday and I feel it wasn't anywhere near being adequate.

I feel overwhelmed and any advice would be greatly appreciated"

So far I've picked up some things but after the two weeks is up I'll fill in whenever someone is on vacation or they need help. This position pays more but it is difficult to get in since there are only 3 spots and most people have been there for 10+ years. TIA for any advice"

"New job, remote learning difficulties","Hi All,
I accepted a new role and have been working for just shy of a month. It’s a completely new industry and there’s so much to learn. Every role I’ve taken has been a new industry, and I’ve been able to dig in and learn.

I’m finding it really difficult since we aren’t in the office and my group is really siloed/full of individual contributors. Everyone is nice and will help if I ask, but lack of face time and exposure is really hurting the learning process. I’m honestly terrified of not excelling and getting let go.

My manager and director are really nice but are in the middle of a huge project so they don’t have a lot of time to meet with me. I’m reading manuals, taking notes, using Google to dig in more but I’m just not feeling confident I’m being set up for success. I’ve always learned hands on - being included in meetings, on emails, etc. but I’m not being looped in even when I’ve asked.

I’m in contact with my previous employer since I left on excellent terms with them but they’re on a hiring freeze until there’s more certainty around COVID and how it’s impacting the business.

My question is - what the heck should I do? I’m going to keep scheduling 1:1s with my boss, but reading 80+ page manuals and ppt overviews without business context is really not cutting it. I’m at the point I don’t even know what questions to ask because I just can’t get the exposure I need to dive in."

Job training was delayed due to COVID-19 about a month ago - is it time to give up?,"Hello,

Long story short - I got hired right before everything got out of control. I was scheduled to start training the end of March, but I still haven't received word from anyone. I emailed/called to check in and keep myself in the loop, but the manager not once replied to my emails or calls. I'd just like to know if I still have this job or not, because if not then I'll have to start yet another gloriously terrible job search...again. The last form of communication I received from the director was the weekend before the training - the voicemail seemed very sincere and reassuring, but I'm still unsure.

But of course, even if they were to email/call me, not quite sure what they would tell me. Our state is scheduled to ""reopen"" around June - is it likely my employer will me around then? My parents are gung-ho about this job and believe my employer *will* call me no matter what, but knowing that ghosting is such a terrible, common practice nowadays I'm starting to get really nervous.

Also, I guess knowing that it has taken me nearly 8 months to land a job after college (this job) has made me cynical and bitter towards all of this. If this job doesn't work out then I seriously don't know what I'm going to do. The thought of sending out more resumes is extremely depressing, to be honest.

What should I do, in your opinion? Wait this out until the end of the month, or start applying for other jobs?"

In fact, I haven’t trained on anything compared to...pretty much everyone. Lately there’s been a lot of changes in the company and I don’t want to get left behind.

"First office job, is training normally this poor?","The people mentoring me blazed through the processes, it was like they were talking to themselves. They told me to write down everything they said. Their mouths struggled to keep up with how fast they were thinking so I was writing furiously for several hours, phrases they nonchalantly mentioned turned out to be critical to understanding what I was supposed to be doing, I only found this out by making them stop and asking what 'SDAQ' meant, i had to stop them every minute for stuff like this, it was ridiculous.

Im left with dozens of pages of disorganized notes, because each time they went through it again I picked up on more and more stuff to add. This made it complicated to organise the steps of each process, and theres a LOT of them.

A few days later I was left to my devices to do what they trained me on, these excel processes take a few hours (there was only 2 run throughs for my training, and that was watching someone), and ask for help if needed. I ended up making a few costly errors.

Im coming to the end of my second week, the assistant manager spoke to me and said she has clearly piled way too much on to me and that im not where i should be."
How relevant are CompTIA Certifications in today's business world?,"Hey Everybody,

A few weeks ago I was laid off due to the current pandemic and have decided to use my free time for things that are more productive. I was thinking of maybe starting towards my CompTIA certifications, beginning with the Core 3 of A+, Network+ and Security+. 

Would not mind getting into PenTesting later on down the road, but my question is, if I were to put the time to study for the A+ test first (and then work my way up), would the certification increase my chances of getting better pay? My current experience is in customer service, mostly entry-level stuff, usually between $14.00 to $16.00 per hour.

I'm in the United States. Based on the job postings I'm seeing it looks like this certification could help me land jobs in the $20.00 per hour range, but I wanted to know how the certification fit into the bigger picture, maybe get some different viewpoints.

I would like to go back to school and get a degree in something, but for now I need to concentrate on staying self-sufficient. Computers have been second-nature to me, and I've helped others build theirs, so the tech stuff doesn't seem to be too much of a problem.

Thoughts? Thanks."
New Employee Concern,I am being trained by an employee who has worked for the company for 15 years and I question his methods. There was a huge disagreement and the manager sided with the employee. He told me that he was concerned about me because I am too anxious about being detailed oriented. This is offensive to me as a new person learning a job that I am not familiar with.

Should I be worried? Should I bring this up with my TL or boss?,"I am not sure about the flair.

Anyway, a little background: I have been an events graphic designer for a company for a little over a month, that has like 70+ events in a year. 

My coworker (A) who is another graphic designer that handles awards in my department told me last Friday that our TL (S) is thinking of hiring another designer to help me with my tasks. But A said that S doesn’t know how to word it to our marketing head/”the boss” (U) without making it sound like a skill problem. Because what if she asks why I can’t handle the tasks by myself? Is it because of my skills or lack thereof? 

The way my job works is that two people from the marketing team (one for summits and one for conferences) sends me design briefs, so I do BOTH the event designs for the summits and conferences. From A and S’s perspective, if the marketing team can have one person for each event, why can’t we have one designer for each instead of me doing both. Note that the person that does the conference marketing is having a difficult time because of her workload.

I’ve been here five weeks. I admit I’m still kinda slow and overwhelmed. However, I was called up by U a day before A told me about what S was thinking of doing. U asked how I was doing because I have been there a month already. She asked if I was overwhelmed, and my go-to response was no. In retrospect, maybe I should have been honest and told her that sometimes I am because of the fact that I am still new and that events overlap with each other so basically I have to do a lot of things for different people at the same time. But IDK, it just felt like the right answer to it was “no” at that time. My thought process was I didn’t want them to regret hiring me because I am incapable of juggling my workload.

On to my tasks… So, what happens when people send me design briefs (DB), is that I or my TL lists them down on this excel to-do list and distribute them throughout the week or the next according to the given deadline. 

**I think my biggest problem is that I tunnel vision**. Like, I only focus on what I’m doing at the moment (usually what’s written first on the list) and then move on to whatever is written next. Also when I get a new DB throughout the day while I’m already doing something, I tend to put off replying to it because I can’t do everything all at once. A, S, and I have different shift schedules. I am left last and sometimes when I am faced with a branding I am unfamiliar with and I have no designers to ask help from, I tend to panic and ask non-designers for help. Sometimes it’s no use as they don’t know the answers either. 

I thought about this last Friday and maybe it would help me a lot if I checked all the DBs for the day *before* starting on anything. If I do that, then I would know what questions to ask the requestors, what files to ask for, what I need help with, and which ones to prioritize before S goes to bed and A leaves the office. Also when I get a new DB when I am alone, I won’t get overwhelmed because I’d know where to put it on my priority list. 

With that said, I do work really hard and try my best to meet the deadlines but sometimes I can’t and have to move them to another date. When I have a lot to do, I can barely quality check before sending them to the requestors. Also the company’s filing and naming systems are still something I am not used to. The email subjects sometimes have acronyms but the design briefs do not and the folder where I am supposed to upload them are named differently as well. We have templates I can use but the file names are so confusing that I can’t find them without someone’s help. That’s really frustrating for me and something I still haven’t gotten used to. People have been super nice and helpful but sometimes they give me impatient vibes, especially S who hired me and is currently training me. An example would be how she responds to my questions, she goes “Giiiirl, that is X. You can find that in the X folder.” Maybe I ask stupid questions, or the same ones and I’m too “slow” for her. I go to her as a last resort now when no one else can answer my questions.

So, I was wondering if I should bring the” hiring a new guy” thing with my S (remember that it was A that told me about hiring a new person not her) and maybe ask her for a productivity review? What exactly do I say? And maybe tell U (marketing head/”the boss”) the truth, the who asked me if I was overwhelmed.

Should I be worried? Maybe they had really high expectations of me when they chose me. And maybe I’m not meeting those expectations. What if I get fired? I actually really enjoy this job even if it is stressful and it would suck to be let go this early."
Are there any jobs that train and pay you?,"I’m looking out there for any IT, Data, Programming, Technology, Engineer jobs(mainly in Florida) that train you? Without having a degree? (Stupid question, I know. But I’m curious)

Also, off topic but which is best? College or Trade school?"
Making Mistakes Months into a Job,"I'm a bit frustrated with myself. I switched from teaching into technical writing, and I am still making tiny mistakes. I'll forget to change the date, or something else like that. I've been at this job for six months, and I'm still overlooking these things, even though I check my work multiple times after finishing it. Though my actual writing is good, I can't stop beating myself up over this issue. My boss is very sweet, kind, and patient - the kind of person that you want to work hard for, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm letting her down. On top of that, I got fired from a brief job I had a while ago because I made a costly mistake. I can't help but feel this threat of being fired for my mistakes looming overhead, even though my boss has been nothing but forgiving and patient of me. 

Any advice or tips to help me keep my job and stop making these mistakes? Thanks."
How do you know you are ready to take on more responsibilities?,"My manager told me that my fear of taking on more (or new) responsibilities and lack of confidence in making decisions is holding me back from moving up the career ladder. He told me that if I can get past these, moving up should be no problem. 

I realised that it's true. My fear of failure gives me anxiety and lowers my confidence level to do new things, or make decisions for fear that they are the wrong ones. When I do new things, I have so nervous that I sit on it for a long time.

How do you overcome that?"
"I'm a week into the training for a new job, and feeling a little overwhelmed and threatened, afraid that I'm going to fail. Any advice?","I got a job in customer service. We're currently training in the routines, software, systems, rules and so on that we'll need once we get put out on the floor.

The training is good. And there's 9 other newbies right alongside me. I know that I'm not behind, at least not the furthest behind. We have test conversations where we get a real life scenario to solve, and from that it's clear that I'm not too terrible at using the software or searching in the routines.

 But there are a lot of routines and rules and things that I don't know. We've taken some customer calls, and I notice that I get stressed, which makes me go quick, which makes me go blank or do a poor job of searching the routines properly. 

It's just customer service, but it's much harder than I thought it would be, at least it seems that way right now. I'm just looking forward to when this all becomes habit, and I can come to work and comfortably and competently do my job. 

I never thought I was the type to write a *""tell me it's all going to be OK*"" type post, but it's been a hard day, and I'm trying to keep a mindset of taking on the challenge, of working to improve, and to not fall into that despairing panic of ""*I'm never going to be able to do a good job here*""."

How long to get used to grill/assembly fastfood job,"I'm going to start my 3rd day tonight and so far this job has made me feel dumb. My previous jobs were dishwasher and warehouse jobs. Those were less memory and multitasking based and more about physical endurance and speed. The only reason I left my last one was because I moved states and someone I know where I'm at currently could automatically get me a job, so rather than sending applications and getting interviews that could be fruitless, I went with the guaranteed job.

I've never felt so incompetent before except maybe when I started my first job, but I felt more physically incompetent, now I just feel dumb. It doesn't help that they didn't have a dedicated person to train me my first day and it was kind of busy."

"Am I not trained well, or just not fit for the job?","I apologize for the blocked text, I'm on mobile 
I recently graduated college and started working my first ""real"" job at a house plant nursery/greenhouse in the western US, been working there a few months now. I have had many internships in such jobs before and love growing plants, but this new job has me more stressed than I have ever been in my life. I come home depressed and paranoid that I did something wrong while at work and will get chewed out for it the next day. Basically my job is to watch about 30-50 greenhouses with new very delicate propagation plants. If any of these houses do not get mist during the day, within 15 minutes they can be damaged or die. Many things can happen, irrigation booms can crash or blow fuses, they could be programmed incorrectly, electricity can surge or drop out for just a little bit which can stop the booms, so we have to constantly be driving around in the farm truck and checking them. I feel like I was undertrained and just thrown into this position but like I said it's my first ""real"" job in the industry so I'm not sure. My boss spent a total of about half a day showing me around and trying to teach me to program booms (there are 3 different software systems to learn) and the rest of what I've learned has been from my coworkers, who were expected to answer all my questions and teach me things while also trying to do their job and watch their own 50 greenhouses. As a result, I felt very much like a nuscance with all my questions especially in the beginning, and made quite a few mistakes because I didn't know any better. On top of that we work in shifts with partners and mine gets very annoyed with me if I make any mistakes at all. As a result I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around my coworkers and am constantly afraid of messing up. The other day we had an electrical problem and some of our plants were damaged, and later I heard him talking badly about me to our other coworkers. Also, whenever my boss sees I have made a mistake he automatically assumes it is because I'm being lazy or not checking my plants and irrigation enough. Now that the growing year is winding down and daylength is shortening our schedule has changed and I am scheduled to watch the entire farm by myself every other day, 10 hour shifts. I was in no way trained to take care of the other parts of the farm, it is completely foreign to me and I feel like I have been just thrown in to sink or swim. I was given a check list and talked to for 10 minutes about what I should do to care for the other part of the farm, but only because I asked. If I hadn't asked I would have gotten nothing. I would have felt much more comfortable shadowing someone else do it for a bit.... What should I do? This job has me so burnt out with worry it's not funny.

Edited to add: literally 6 people have come and gone from this position in the past 3 years. I didn't know this until I was already hired"
Nothing to do at work after 8 months," Cross post from r/AskEngineers

**Context:** I work for this smallish tech company that has about 300 employees. The company culture is still start-up like because of their size. I am a communication systems engineer. I have pretty much been working on the same assignment with slightly different variations for the past 8 months.

The first 3 or 4 months went by extremely quickly as I was learning new things non-stop like how to interface with the product, learning Python and all of the company's internal codebases, figuring out how to set up instruments properly to capture data, fixing problems as I uncovered them, etc.

The next 2 months slowed down but I used it as an opportunity to go back and really iron out all the stuff that I had worked on previously. I prettied up my testing scripts, made them easier to debug and extend, and spent a lot of effort figuring out how to best display my testing results so that others would understand.

For the last 3 months, I have been doing nothing useful at work. I had enough free time that I was able to fully automate my tests which ... means I have even less to do. I have been coming in late and only leaving slightly later than normal to offset that, but I really feel like the weeks go by without me having done any actual productive work. I keep asking my boss for more assignments to work on, but most of what he assigns are a slight variations of stuff that I am already doing.

He tells me that he wants me to get trained on other parts of the systems we're working on but hasn't made any time to do so. What has been happening is he runs through a quick explanation and points me to an out-of-date resource to read on my own time. I quickly realize that the resource doesn't apply to the project's current status and I explain it to him. He's a bit surprised and tells me that he's a little busy but that we should have a conversation about how to proceed later. I flag him down at a later time and the cycle repeats itself.

I'm getting really anxious because of the lack of work and direction. Is this normal? I've tried offering to help other people around the company too but they usually don't have stuff for me to do. I've been picking up other, non-coding, skills that could help me out at work but I don't have any chance to apply them because of the lack of assignments / training."
"Besides ""software engineering"", what are some great skills one can dedicate time learning so they make some good money in IT?",Programming seems to be the go-to skill for greatly increasing your salary but what other skills can one learn? I just want to see my options so I know what I can possibly dedicate time to learning.
Leadership/executive training programs...what to expect,"Long story short, I got placed into a leadership training program, and I’m not exactly sure what to expect. We’re about 3 months into a year-long program, and it’s been great so far but I guess I’m a little unclear on what the endpoint expectation should be. This is the first year my company has done something like this, so I think everyone is kind of figuring it out together (even though several members of the leadership team driving it have been part of similar programs at other companies). I’m curious to see if anyone here has done something similar and if so, what has your experience been in terms of the opportunities that opened up as a result? 

A couple specific questions:
- I’ve received a couple promotions and several raises in the 5 years I’ve been here, but I’m not 100% clear on my own career path at this company mostly due to the way my specific department (marketing) is structured. How forthright should I be in my expectation for some career pathing to come as a result of completing this program?
- I’m obviously not looking to leave any time soon, but if I were to look for outside opportunities, how do you put something like this on a resume?"
What Professional Development opportunities would you recommend?,"My workplace just told us that there's an opportunity to take a course for professional development before the end of the year. This is great, but this is not a benefit we knew we had, so now I'm desperately trying to think of something I'd like to gain more skills in.

I work in the recreation at a community centre. I've been in the field on and off for a 3-4 years. I'm not quite sure what I want to do after, but I'd love to stay in recreation or transition to tourism or outdoor adventure. Most of the ideas I have for professional development are certifications (a more advanced first aid, mental health first aid), but I look forward to seeing what other opportunities there may be out there.

There's no real budget, but we just need to request it and see if it will be approved. I assume we won't be allowed to take a course that's more than 1-2 days long.

Thanks in advance!"
Tips On How To Succeed As A Cashier?,"Yesterday I had an interview for a cashier position at a grocery store, and I actually ended up getting it!

Originally the deal that I agreed to was that I'd train on manual machines for 1 year and then move on to the CNCs. I still haven't touched a CNC machine because I'm ""fine on the manual machines.""

"My boss sent me an email telling me that if I have any questions or need help, such requests need to go through my boss. My boss then sent an email that I found out about to my coworkers titled “Delegating to (my name).” I assume it said not to help me. How do I deal with this?","Context: My boss says I’m underperforming (not formally documented, though) because I ask them too many questions, and so I told _their_ boss that I will fix that by just asking my colleagues questions, since my colleagues all ask each other questions and whatnot. My boss gives very unclear instructions, anyway, and gets mad at me for not understanding them, so going to my colleagues allows me to learn at a much faster pace.

So I stopped asking my boss questions and just ask my colleagues now, and we’re all cool with each other and very non-political. No egos or anything.

My performance immediately shot through the roof this week. So much so that I asked my boss if there was anything I could do better, and they said “no.”

Well now they tell me I need to start going through them again, so as to minimize interruptions to my colleagues. OK...well, there’s a lot of stuff I haven’t been trained on, and my colleagues tell me to just ask them questions, because that’s what they all do anyway. But then my boss sends out this mysterious email (of which I do not know the contents) telling them something related to me.

QUESTIONS:

**Should I go to their boss to tell them that they’re doing this and that I and the team found a more efficient way for me to learn?** My boss’s boss is all about asking me what tools I need to succeed, and we agreed that me asking my colleagues for help is a good idea."
"New hire at a small importer, and I am having 2 roles dropped on me almost immediately","I was recently hired at a small import company that is based above their brick-and-mortar store. I wanted this job, and they wanted me, so the hiring process was all good and I am happy.

However, on my first day I found out 2 core coworkers out of the 5 here in the office are LEAVING. (They are both coincidentally moving back to their home countries, not a job related departure...)

The boss is mostly an accountant, and the other person is a part-timer, mostly accounting. The 2 leaving were doing all the orders and buying, communicating with the warehouse and overseas vendors, etc.

I've had an interest in this world for a while, and I'm finally in it, but my training is going to be mercilessly short and hasty. I have a strong office admin background, I am just starting to get nervous that when these 2 key members leave I will be swamped.

What can I do to make this transition easier on myself? What are the key things I should ask for now? I want to someday soon be a buyer for this company, and with my immediate mentors leaving soon (by end of March), I am worried about letting people down.

Note: They do say the warehouse office staff will be available to help me, but they are based 9 hours south of us, so phone and email are the only ways they'd be able to help."
Boss says I can’t use my learning disability as a “crutch” for not learning fast enough. What should I do?,"So I work at a chain retail store. My hours are usually between 25-34 hours a week plus I have to go to university full time. I’ve been working at the store for about a month now and there’s tons of tasks that vary day to day. Some of them being fairly consistent and some of them being extremely random. I haven’t had a job in 4 years due to raising my baby sister. Because the extremely random jobs are things I haven’t done before my coworkers get annoyed when I ask questions on specifically what to do (the instructions aren’t detailed in any way. If they tell me to go get something from the back it takes me a bit longer because they never tell me somewhat specific location directions and get mad when I don’t know it/take longer to find it). 

I have extremely bad ADD/ADHD depending on my bipolar disorder. I’ve explained to them again and again how I genuinely have a hard time processing terms that I haven’t heard of and it takes me a little bit of time to get the hang of things. Because of this I’ve been told I could potentially get fired because of how bad my learning speed is and that I’m not trying hard enough. 

I’m completely lost as to what I should do. I thought about transferring stores but my manager obviously doesn’t like me in the first place. I was thinking about getting a psychiatrist note but even then they’ll still treat me like a burden."
Fear of being fired with in the 90 day probation period,"Hello everyone... I’m kinda paranoid at the moment. I was getting fired from my job of 3 years because I got into a car accident and I was basically useless to them. Then I got hired at a new place at a Clinc and as a receptionist and I let the manager know that I know nothing about being a animal receptionist but I did have experience being a receptionist because of my old job , the manager told me that fine and that she would train me.. 3 weeks into the job I got fired because the manager didn’t want to train me anymore because she didn’t have time ( the manager has only been there for a month at the time) I figured out I was being fired because the manager was  training another girl to be the receptionist while I was sitting right next to them. Now this job I’m a receptionist at a Animal Hospital and I am terrified of getting fried from here , I told the manager that I had little to no experience being a Animal receptionist and she said that’s fine and that I will be trained.. I am currently in training and I’m getting the handle of things .. things have been looking good.. untill I went on linkined in and the manager job posted my job. I don’t under stand I thought I was doing ok.. it’s been a week now that the Job post is up.. I don’t know what to do.. should I look for another job? Should I calm down..

3 month review: boss told me I need to grow a backbone,"I recently started a job that is very similar to a health inspector (think Hugo from Bob's Burgers) but is not in the food industry.  I go in and inspect places, educate them, give citations, and sometimes even shut places down.  You can guess that most of the people I deal with have some very choice words for me.  I've been yelled at and threatened.  I've only been given a few assignments since starting.  Got the job through a friend after taking some classes and obtaining certificates.

Boss calls me into the office for a review.  Very much a ""no beating around the bush"" sorta guy.  Tells me I need to grow a backbone.  To be honest, he's right.  I am awful at dealing with confrontation.  You wouldn't guess it by looking at me, but when people start becoming aggressive with me, I tend to lose focus which exposes my lack of experience.  I've been in the customer service industry for so long that my automatic response is to calm the situation by trying to appease the aggressor in any way possible.  This usually worked with your average Karen, but has not been very successful in my new line of work.

I've tried getting advice from my coworkers, but everyone just says the same thing: ""Just man up!""  How the hell do I go about doing that?  I have to confront a guy tomorrow who has multiple violations and has already been a huge prick to me.  I'm dreading it.

I'm hoping someone on here has been in a similar scenario that could offer some advice on how to toughen myself up.  I can't give up on this job.

I apologize if this doesn't fit in this subreddit.  Thanks."
How to ask for training compensation?,"TLDR: began job in law firm 3 months ago, never worked in legal. Trying to manage teaching myself the law side, while also learning what makes up the job. Was told this week that I am training a new employee. I don’t know the job in it’s entirety itself, let alone to teach someone. 


Started at a law firm about 3 months ago completing ‘signings’ (when the clients sign their papers. My job is highly interactive , being a go between of the lawyer and who he retains. 

Since I began I’ve been thrown into the work: being forced to complete the signings alone with the clients 4 weeks after starting. This is going through 300 page documents explaining their life’s work and hoping I do it correctly. I’ve voiced my opinion many times to my office manager and boss about how I don’t feel comfortable and like I’m educated enough about the material, but they believe in me. 

I was told this week that I’m going to be training a new client liaison, who will do the same job as me since we are so busy. I just hit my 3 month mark, and still have multiple questions everyday about the job I’m doing. 

How do I go about asking for more compensation because of this additional training aspect? Or do I even? I feel so out of touch with ‘law” because I’ve never worked in this sort of field. Not only am I learning the actual meat of what I’m going over, but I’m still learning the process of how to go over the stuff."

Contract job: Training-related question,"I'm a registered nurse in Canada and recently got a clinical educator contract job. My employer agreed to pay me 4 hours for completing the online modules, but I'm pretty sure it will take me 8 hours to complete all the modules plus online tests (each module and follow up test has taken me 30 min to complete so far). 

I'm just wondering if it's worth bringing up with my employer or whether it sounds like a ridiculous request. I'm asking for double the hours but I'm finding the content from the modules is more medical and pharmacy-related than what I've been taught in nursing school. Should I track my hours and present how long it took me to complete the modules? Or is it assumed that my education should have taught me the content already but the modules act as a review? This is my first time working in a contract position but it looks like I'll be working here for the next two years, so I'd like to keep good relations with my employer. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: should I ask my employer to pay me more hours for training?"
Customers at the retail store I work at were leaving without paying. Is it my fault or managements’?,"Hey, to give you a lil bit of background, I’m a college graduate who has fallen on hard times. I was fired from my previous office job and have taken a retail job in the meantime until I find something better.

I started work as a cashier three days ago. I was shown a thirty minute video for training then put straight on to the registers. We would have customers pick up online orders. We retrieve the items for them and hand them to the customers.

Well, there’s a receipt attached to the items ordered online. I didn’t think much of it. On my third day, I was scolded by my manager for almost letting a woman leave with the attached receipt. He told me to never let them leave with the receipt, and that by not having a manager scan the accompanying receipt, the customer never pays for it as the system only has the customer pay once it knows that they have left the store.

So I basically let hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise out of the store, without the customer paying. I was honest with my manager about it and let him know that this needs to be made clear to all of the new store associates.

Later that night, I told my coworker the story and she said that she did the same exact thing the first few days she worked there. She only found out about it on her third day there, just like I did.

Is this managements fault or mine?"
"I made a mistake on my first day of work, and now I feel bad.","I just got hired as an inventory/utility person at a new hospital cafe. I was sweeping the dining area today, and I noticed the area where a woman was eating was a little trashy. I asked her, ""Is it okay if I sweep around you?"" She said, ""Not really because I am eating, but go ahead."" I told her, ""I'm sorry you're right, it's my first day I'm learning."" I thought about it afterwards, and yeah it's rude to sweep and clean around people while they are eating. Only go to tables and areas that are empty and clean them. I felt bad because I made a mistake and the woman was probably a little ticked off. I do not want to make the customers feel unwelcome and unhappy.

I definitely learned my lesson from this, but I still feel bad. What do you guys think?"

Should I attend an expensive training seminar on my company's dime if I've been casually looking for a new job?,"My company is supportive of attending these types of things once or twice a year. I've had my eye on one for a little while that's a few thousand dollars. I'd love to go, but I've been casually looking for another job.

If my future at my current company is uncertain, should l avoid pursuing pricey learning opportunities like this on their tab?

Edit: thanks everyone for the great discussion and advice! A few answers to common questions:

1. I'm only on the hook for the cost of the program if it's for tuition reimbursement. This is not one of those programs, so it would be covered in full by the company with no repayment clause that I'm aware of.

2. This training will be very beneficial to my career development no matter where I end up in the future. It is not company- or industry-specific.

3. I have no plan or exit strategy at my current company, just throwing my resume out whenever I see a great opportunity. I am ready to leave if any of these opportunities materialize."
Starting a seasonal job as an “Elf/Santa’s Helper” and starting the second day they want me to work alone!?!,"I went to “training” yesterday and it most certainly was not training. They didn’t have me do anything. It’s only four of us working this season and I’m the only one who hasn’t done this so everyone was in a rush to go home since we had to meet up late. They showed me around the program but that’s about it. Not how to get kids to Santa or what to say to people, how to take/print photos or anything!! My first day I work four hours and by the next day she wants me working by myself and doing end of day and even taking the money to the bank!! Yes “Santa” will be there with me but he can’t help me because he has to keep his act together while in public.. I’m so scared about working by myself when I literally know nothing! It’s only until Christmas Eve, but I have anxiety through the roof when it comes to this stuff!! I’ve been out of a job for a little while so having to interact with people by myself is nerve wracking...... Any tips or advice?"
Was this a critical mistake I made at work?,"I am 22 years old. I work in a new hospital cafe doing Utility/Inventory. This cafe opened in July, and I have been working there since August. It's my first job. Typically I don't work out front serving food and what not. Since we were short two people today and it was busy, my manager had me serving food today. I have not been trained or prepared to do this. He just threw me out there.

I think I did pretty well even though I was nervous and I had to ask my coworkers lots of questions on how to do things.

However, there was one thing in particular that I messed up on and I am beating myself up over it.

This week at work we are selling tacos and nachos. As I was serving a few people, some of them asked if they could have like their salsa and stuff on the side. As I was putting their food in the containers, I like put the salsa outside the container to itself. Like you have the tacos and stuff in the container with plastic wrap, and I put like the salsa outside the plastic wrap to itself. I now realize that was not the best way to do it.

I didn't know until a coworker mentioned it that we have plastic cups for side stuff to be placed in. I was upset with myself that I ruined a few customers servings. Also for one lady, I accidentally put salsa on her food container and it was dripping on the side. I felt bad about that. I directed her where our napkins are.

I didn't know though. I didn't know that we had those plastic cups. Had I known that, I would've put their side stuff in them. The way I was doing it was kind of sloppy.

Doing things like this is how you lose customers. I would hate to be the reason why customers don't come back.

This was my first time serving and I was not trained to do it.

Was this a terrible mistake?"
"I took a training course on harassment. It seems there is a gender bias, why?","I took a training in harrassment in the workplace. It seemed to me that in the training, the woman was always the victim. So much that a few male staff member said something about it. I work in the mental health field and I do not believe that portrayal is accurate. I work with an almost 90% female population and have seen and heard some women be  unprofessional as well. Much more than then the men I've worked with. However, in the training it just made it seem that men are always the aggressor. Isn't this a type of indoctrination, making it seem women are always the victim?"
[Serious] Has anyone here ever been hired because of a free online certification?,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

Currently I am on the hunt for a job that pays better and is a better work environment. What I am looking for is a job in the trades, for instance an electrician, a plumber, an auto mechanic, medical technician, a HVAC, etc. What I am curious to know is if it's actually worth it to study online courses to land a better job. Pretty much any job nowadays, even entry level, will require you to have some form of certification or experience just to get in. How do you break the ice to get into a decent job? I am looking for a higher paying, better quality professional job.

&#x200B;

Have any of you tried computer coding and has that worked out for you? Or do you think that there's other careers to consider.

The three fields I'm looking into is:

1. The trades
2. Government
3. Computer technology (very broadly ""coding"" , other forms of computer level work)

&#x200B;

Any thoughts or experiences are welcomed in regards to any success taking free online courses to land into jobs."
How do you adjust to a new job?,"I got a job at Brusters and today was my first day/training day and I messed up quite a bit. Not too bad, though. I’m nervous for taking orders and accidentally messing up. Advice?"
Extremely slow job starts?,"So i just graduated with an environmental science degree in May and finally find a job that didn't decide to rescind their offer for no reason !(happened once lol) the people are really nice and I really enjoyed my first day


The only thing is, there was a LOT of downtime, and my 2 managers basically said the first month or so is going to be very slow and to ""get used to it""(albeit they said it in a nice way)

It's also weird because I don't have a computer to use yet, so if I want to look up stuff that can potentially help me ( it's a regulatory based job, so looking up some regulation that I need to refresh myself on can really help) I have to use my phone which looks like I'm texting or redditing or something. And sitting around doing nothing makes me feel like I'm just wasting time.

I'm sure tomorrow on day 2 they will have more time(today both of my managers were in meetings all day and told me that it was payroll day. Initially my first day was supposed to be tomorrow, but they wanted me in asap)and they will be able to give me more stuff to do probably more training but yeah."
Overwhelmed Package handler,As the title says. I work at FedEx. Today was my first day and I’m already overwhelmed. Out of all the candidates they put me with the worst driver. His truck is “special” and isn’t to be loaded like the rest. He has a perplexing system for his truck. He also was very boorish to me. I already feel like and idiot and don’t know if I can stick with this. Any advice. Thanks
Hotel sharing norms?,"I am going to an expenses-paid seminar in another city for a few days this summer. I have the option to share a hotel room with another attendee, or pay the difference to have my own room.  


I would prefer to share a room and save that cash, but my only question is about what companies usually consider when placing roommates together. I only want to be placed with someone the same sex as me, for no reason other than that is what I'd feel more comfortable with. Is that something most companies would do by default or should I request that specifically?  


If anyone else has any additional insight on hotel sharing etiquette and expectations, please feel free to share! This is completely new territory to me."
What's empathy and how do I fake it even though it sounds stupid?,"Like some ppl don't care if you're empathic and they need their problem and issues resolve as soon as possible. But why stay empathic when its going to annoy my clients or myself?

My trainer said I need to have empathy when I already have it or thinks I'm sympathic or something now he is very happy and wants me to get hired in the company and actually succeed on doing my job.

If bpo is really that basic and stressful, should I like sell houses and condos instead of relying on such a high demand and low expectation with 400 usd per month job? I'm from the Phillippines and I need help with this."
"My cash drawer was short, how do I NOT do this I'm the future?","I'm at a brand new job, it was my 2nd day. At the end of the day my cash drawer was short by less than a dollar. I didn't get in trouble or anything, I just don't want this to happen again. Im pretty sure I was counting the correct change, so I'm not sure what I did wrong, if anybody has an advice it would be greatly appreciated, like tips or tricks."
19. Lost and confused. Want to do some type of trade. Where to begin? Any help is appreciated,"So I’m 19 and college just wasn’t for me. 


I’m eager to start a career and get out of my parents house. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to do so. I just want to start something that has a livable wage ($19+ an hour)


I’ve been looking into joining an apprenticeship program through a union, but there’s a bit of an “old boys club” mentality, meaning that you kind of have to know someone to make it in a trade. I don’t know anyone.


So any tips? What should I do? I’m in Illinois if that helps."
Trying to build skills on a low budget with less than great hours.,"I graduated in May with a design degree and I ended up taking a job at a coffeehouse while I kept looking for work. I was hoping to figure out where I wanted to specialize as a designer so I could better market myself and improve on my craft (Also it turns out that my year was the last year my college would offer my program, so yay! /s). I did eventually sorta figure out that I like working with textiles and as well as working on UX/UI. I was hoping that my time working in food service would only be tempory but it now been over 6 months and nothing has really come to fruition. I want to end up doing something that is meaningful and pays the bills, but I feel like I never have the time, money, or energy.

 I wanted to work on retooling some of my old portfolio pieces that I made in college, but I haven't been able to do so because Adobe is ridiculously expensive when not paying student prices. I've ran into the same issue with textiles because cloth isn't cheap and even the budget-esque practice of making a muslin so as to not use more expensive materials is still more than I can justify as of current. I've been spending money on paying for a domain name that never left a private setting thinking that I could make a blog/ online portfolio site to better promote myself but never could really get everything to run right. I feel like I'm held down by a ton of financial barriers, and that isn't including that I need to start paying back student loans this month.

Time is also a major constraint at the moment. I don't have a car which forces me to use a less than substantial bus system. On average I'll spend 30 minutes a day heading into work, and depending on when I get off, I can end up spending over an hour to get home like I did last night.  I live in the midwest and the temperature has been at or below freezing for a week now. Its really not even properly winter yet, since temps can hang around 0 degrees Farenheit for months. Honestly just having to commute ends up draining a ton of energy, especially when I realize that if I did have a car my commute would take around 20 minutes for a round trip. Being reliant on the bus schedule also limits where I can search for a job and what hours I can work, because the bus cut off before 8pm and run on an hourly schedule. Even if money were not an barrier, I would still be at the mercy of a rapidly fluctuating schedule that leaves me feeling unable to work on anything because I'm constantly having leave far earlier than I need for a shift in order to actually be on time.

In short, I feel that I can make something out of my skills and creative drive but I dont have the time or money necessary to do so. I'm currently looking for a better paying job that has me work more regular hours but so far I've been striking out.  Do I just need better discipline when it comes to practicing, or is there something that I'm missing that I could be working on? I really want to start getting to a better situation fast. I feel like my mental health has really been affected by this."
Training Course Dilemma,"First off, thanks for reading this. I am in a bit of a catch 22 situation right now with this training course which my boss would like me to take. 

It is not required, but I did tell my boss I was interested in taking the course. It is going to cost $1,200 which is basically an entire paycheck for me. I can fill out a company form for tuition reimbursement, however, I have to sign an agreement that if I stay with the company for 6 months I owe 50% of the course or a full year for 0%.  I personally do not see myself staying here any longer than maybe 3 more months at most, so I would basically have to pay for the entire course on my own. 

My question is how can I tactfully say to my boss that I no longer would like to take the course without giving the impression that I plan on leaving at some point in the near future? I don't want to be $1,200 in the hole because I took a course for a career path I am no longer interested in anymore."
"Going to start working at a gas station soon. I've never smoked or played the lottery before, what are some terms customers use when requesting specific cigarettes and/or lottery tickets that I should be aware of?","My store does not sell alcohol, but has a large selection of tobacco products that I'm wholly unfamiliar with.

What is a cool little side gig you can do for extra income?,"I've been pondering this for the last while. So far I've come up with:

5) Tutor.

Any other ideas?"
Just got hired at Walgreens! Any advice for a newbie?,"I had my interview at Walgreens today and got hired immediately. I'm a little nervous... this is my going to be first job straight outta high school, and I've heard tons of bad things about retail like ahem rude customers. Not sure if I'm ready to deal with those type of people lol. I'm not as quick as other people, so I prefer to take things step by step. Also I have a bit..no A LOT of social anxiety and last thing that I want to happen is to get screwed over at my first ever job.

Anyone with experience in retail, but specifically Walgreens, can you pitch in and tell me about your experience working there? I know that it's different at every store but I just want to get a general idea of what it's like so I know what type of environment I'll be working in for the next weeks to come. What did you find particularly challenging about your job? Any rude customer stories and how you dealt with them? Advice you would give to someone like me who struggles with said issues?

Thanks!"
Should a company's conference travel benefit cover all expenses?,"My company gives us a benefit that for $Xk, we can go to any conference we want. Supposedly that includes the cost of attendance, airfare, and hotel. When I asked my manager if this also covers food and local travel to and from the conference, he said he thinks it is not included, that is our responsibility. That seems ridiculous to me that we can be sent to a conference but not allowed to expense food. 

I know typically when a company sends you on travel, everything must legally be covered by the company withing some reasonable limits they set. 

Does this fall under that requirement? Or is it different because it's presented as a benefit? Maybe it's more of a stipend, I don't know what they officially call it. Also is this $Xk taxable?"
How long should it take someone to fully be on their own in a new job?,"I’m 24. I started my new job 2 weeks ago as a legal assistant. Professionally, my background is in criminal law and drug and alcohol. 

I had an internship in probation and parole with a full caseload which is why I was hired for this job with the public defenders office - they use the same programs and procedures tend to cross over. They flat out told me they didn’t want to have to train someone. 

I understand just about everything, I’m doing my own work filing motions, doing paperwork, managing cases with no questions whatsoever. I’ve essentially been thrown to the sharks, sink or swim. However, I also handle bench warrants and extraditions that I didn’t have to deal with in this aspect. 

Warrants and extraditions are very complex, there’s a lot of steps required and one size doesn’t fit all. When it comes to this, I’m constantly asking questions and I’m getting confused easily. I’m not doing them consistently because those hearings are only MWF and I could have 0 or 10 to do. 

The people around me tell me that it takes a while to understand and encourage the questions. I just feel bad asking questions a lot and feel like I’m annoying at this point. 

How long should it take someone to fully understand what the hell is going on? When do employers begin to get annoyed with a new employee?"
Validity of Certification Courses,"A couple years ago, I took a job as a Reading Specialist. One of my goals was to leave formal classroom teaching. This year I’m teaching six classes...

There are new schools opening all the time in my district, and it’s pretty easy to transfer. Testing Coordinator is a job which posts a lot, and I’m fully qualified except for MS Excel experience. I have general experience with Excel both for personal and work use, but I’d say I’m still at novice level.

I’m thinking of taking various Excel certifications. Do employers take this seriously, or do they want hands on experience? I assume they’d want the latter if Excel is the focus of the job, but it’s only part of it."
improperly trained and no one will believe me.,"so to avoid a rant i'll just give the details.

two weeks ago i was hired on as a shipper at a local warehouse, there are a number of them around so they sent me off to get trained in another building a city or two over.

From the very start i was given very little explanation on how to do anything and whenever i asked a question i was given an exasperated sigh and retold the same thing i was just told which doesn't explain the task only how to complete it, not what im doing, just push these buttons, input this number, press enter.

i figured it was a bad day but it went on like this for 2 weeks with my trainer steadily growing more and more angry with me but not telling me anything, I had no idea what i was doing to make them upset so in the end i basically just shut down and waited to be told what to do, I did have a moment or two of extreme frustration bordering on anger because I had no idea what i was doing and ever question was answered with something like ""that's just what we do""

the building i was training at no longer wants me to show up for the last two days of training, so im going to the building im supposed to be working in, the problem is word of my negativity and attitude have spread so my reputation is already sullied in my actual work environment.

I've talked with 3 different managers and expressed that I really don't know what i know and what i don't know, that my training isn't going well, and in effect i was told to shut up and do what im told, the man training me eventually tried to get me sent back to my building but was unsuccessful at first.

Im pretty sure im going to get fired tomorrow over something i can no longer fix, and issues no one will care to listen too.

we also have a whatsapp group to ask questions to each other and get information on whats coming up, I was removed from that group. I feel like i've already been fired."
How do you deal with the anxiety that you're not qualified for a job?,"Does anyone else feel like they're not bright enough or fast enough to learn a job, even though that's unlikely to be true? It's like this anxious feeling that you're going to fail at a job. Has anyone ever applied and gotten a job they were initially scared of from the job description but ended up excelling in the role?"
Is it bad I asked to change my training?,"So long story short, I have an issue of being a people pleaser. Got hired for a job on spot today for a part time office job, she loved me, liked my resume cover letter and just me in general. She asked if I could train this Tuesday and maybe Thursday. I said yes since I’m a people pleaser.

Issue is ... Tuesday and Thursday this week I had already committed to watching people’s kids for their back to school night events! And yeah, canceling childcare is kind of a hassle to deal with and can leave the family hanging. 

So I emailed saying:

Hi ____ - 

I am working Tuesday and
Thursday this week. I had already committed to these days and I don’t feel comfortable cancelling. Can we please change training to the following week?

Let me know!

Best,

(Me)


Should I not have done this? I’m worried about it costing me the job etc. but I just felt bad also breaking my prior commitments."
Advice for a soon to be “shipping and receiving clerk”?,"This week I will be starting a job as a shipping and receiving clerk. As described by my future boss during the interview, I will work in the back garage area where the shipments come in and out. I’ll be the one to direct the truck drivers and such. I’ll also be using a computer software to enter data about shipments that come in and out. It’s hands on, I’ll have to prepare the boxes and such I think.

The reason for this post is that I’d like advice on how to do this job as well as possible. I’d like to get a head start on learning the ins-and-outs before I even begin training so that when I do get trained in I can be as efficient and productive as possible. 

...Basically, I want to learn how to do this job before they teach me in order to make the most of my training.

Any pointers from someone whose worked this position, a similar position, or has worked around someone with this position is greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
Leaving a job before training is over,"In May I accepted a job offer. Seemed great! I needed a summer job and it had good pay, super flexible, meaningful work, everything I wanted! It was an entry level job so I wasn’t expecting training to be so dense.

As we’re entering June, I’m still going through online modules and more training. At this point I won’t see a paycheck until the end of June. I’m going through the money I have saved up and really can’t afford to keep waiting to start. I’ll get a minimal stipend at the end of training but after that I’m not sure when I’ll see a solid paycheck. 

Today I started looking for an escape route and started applying for different jobs. I got a call back immediately from a job that more so aligns with my career path. The person seemed very excited about my previous experience and wanted me to interview as soon as Friday. 

If the interview goes well and can start giving me hours soon, I’ll take that over the job I’m training for now. 

How would I go about quitting? I feel kinda bad for wasting their time especially since I really respect what the company does, but it just isn’t meeting my needs right now."
"1 Month Free Time, What Class/Certification Should I Take?","Used to work in customer support at a startup that has now gone under. While I search for a new job I want to devote half my days to a class. Any suggestions about a type of class/certification I could get in a month that would help on my resume?

I want out of customer support, my plan right now is to apply for any jobs at educational institutions so I can work there and take discount classes part time. 

Some careers I want to explore: data analytics, UIUX, computer coding. I know, I’m all over the place. I WAS going to do an intro class for each topic (like Harvard’s CSx50 for coding) while I worked customer support—but then I lost my job and my timeline accelerated my timeline.

I will work another customer support job if I have to temporarily but I really really do not want to.

I’ve thought about taking a SQL or Python class, but not sure if 1 month of that would be enough to put on resume. What type of class would look good on your resume?"
Managers at new job give me anxiety??,"I work at a tea shop and have had prior experience at a different cafe. I got hired, I assume, because of my prior experience. The place I work at now is relatively new, having been opened at the beginning of the year, and I know that they want to uphold a good reputation within the community so it's important for the owners (the 3 of them own/manage the store) to keep the drinks in consistent flavor and quality.

I know that they probably had high expectations since I've worked at a different cafe before and therefore have had similar experience, but the thing is that the process for making drinks are radically different. I do have some transferable skills, but for the most part 90% of getting things done right is memorizing the new recipes and techniques.

So far I've worked 3 shifts (technically 4 but my first shift was mostly training so it wasn't a full shift of me working). Today was my 3rd shift.

The issue I'm having is that 2 of the 3 managers are giving me anxiety about messing up. Again, I know that they want their products to be the best that it can be, but it doesn't help when I can tell they're getting angry at me for it. When I get anxious, my mind pulls blanks and I stand there staring, trying to think about what to do but at the same time my mind isn't thinking at all. It just freaks out. I've only worked with the 3rd manager once and because he was so chill, I was able to relax and think through the recipes. I only made one minor mistake that day. I know he oversaw me make drinks, I know I didn't struggle as much as I did today.

For example, there are ""cheat sheets"" on the wall to help baristas make the drinks. There was a seasonal drink I had to make, and being new, I was looking at the wall to double check to see how to make it. My manager saw me and mentioned something like, ""You're still looking at those? That's not good."" and shook her head, despite this drink being a ""special"" drink. To me this was absurd because a) I'm new, and b) no one taught me how to make this drink; it's not a staple drink that is popular and is in stock year round so I'm sure even the baristas that had been there for a while would have to take a peak at the recipe. But the comment that bothered me the most today was when the other manager said to me, ""if you worked at another tea place shouldn't you be picking up on this faster?""

I don't know how to calm myself down when they watch me make drinks anymore. It's a minimum wage job, it's close to my house, and I'm a college student who needs money. I'm terrified to get back to work or even to get fired, and after today I was debating on quitting before they get the chance to fire me.

Is it normal for managers to be this passive aggressive or am I just freaking out? Is it worth it to stick with this job or should I find a different one/quit??"
Is it possible to get a job as a drug and alcohol counselor when I never myself have been addicted to drugs or alcohol?,"I have a BA in Psychology and been seeing lots of drug and alcohol counselling positions lately. I am thinking of finishing my addiction studies classes and then get certified. Wondering if I would be looked down upon because of my lack of not going through addiction? I applied for a basic residential job and was turned down. 

Any ideas?"
How can I become less thin-skinned?,"Hi, I started a job recently working for a local government in a small town where everyone is really judgmental and combative, and hostile to outsiders. I relocated to take this position, and everyone in the local clique is mad I was hired over a particular local person (I'm more qualified). Since I'm a public servant I interface with the general public often, and they're usually coming to me to criticize or complain about how I'm doing my job. 

I'm not used to having to constantly defend myself. I get anxious and all of a sudden my brain shuts down and I can't articulate in a professional manner why I have made the particular choices I've made in this role. My mind goes blank. 

Is there a professional training where you constantly get ragged on and beat down that I can go through to get good at being attacked? Any suggestions are welcome.

"Let's be real - most jobs are not that hard, so why don't companies train anymore?","Except for maybe fighter pilots, astronauts, F100 CEOs, and ER docs the vast majority of jobs are really not that hard and most people can do a good job if trained. (Except F100 CEOS all those mentioned happen to have intense training too)

&#x200B;

So why don't companies train workers? I spoke with a friend who works in HR and he claimed that it's too expensive to train employees. (I didn't mention that just last month he was complaining about how they can't find anyone to fill their openings!)

&#x200B;

In reality it seems like leaving a job open and as a result work unfinished and companies understaffed/inefficient is way more costly to a business than training someone.

&#x200B;

What do you all think? Should companies train employees? Is HR just populated by fools unable to properly perform their tasks?"
Got stuck in a department I don’t know anything about. Bad day. Feeling lost.,"So I started a new job a week ago today. I applied for a position, got it, but they moved me over to a different department; one I know absolutely nothing about. Like, someone could burn their house down if I tell them the wrong thing know nothing about it. 

My supervisor said that was fine, just be honest with people that you don’t know their technical questions, and just point them to whatever item they’re looking for. 

Today, when my sup went to lunch, I was left alone to cover the department and had a customer asking for a specific kind of wire. Only being there a week, I’m not at all well versed in what wires we have, or what they do, so of course the customer got upset. 

And that’s fine. I’ve done retail before. I can handle people being rude or dicks. But this customer went to the front to complain about me, and when the employee they sent back with him couldn’t find what he was looking for, he went to a different apartment to complain. 

When the supervisor came back from lunch, I told them what happened and they were very sympathetic and understanding and basically told me to brush it off, before going to tell the neighboring department’s supervisor what happened. 

My confidence was already low working somewhere I’m not familiar with, and being berated by a customer is always rough, but now I’m embarrassed the two departments surrounding me know what happened as well. My day was shot basically, and I hid as much as I could until my shift was over. 

I’m working the department by myself tomorrow and feeling really anxious about it. (Why am I working an entire department alone after seven days????) I want to do a good job and show my worth, especially to my coworkers who  a) I’ve had to bother relentless for help this past week, and b) seem generally chill about it, but I just feel so useless and in the way. 

How can I go about learning more about what I’m doing and carry my weight? Should I just try and turn tail to another department?"
Job training is taking way too long,"My manager is basically the only one who trains me. In past jobs I was trained not only by the manager but others who were either the main person who did the specific process, whomever was the most proficient or whomever had the time. This manager has not made enough time. I have been there several months and should have been trained in most areas of the job description. The team I work with understand the slowness but it doesn't help that I cannot help them at the level I should be. 

This boss has many meetings during the day and has lagged a lot on my training. And lately when I have been trained it is during my lunch time (east coast time sucks). No apologies that it is my lunch time. Then, I miss certain things within the office when they have a social gathering for a celebration. Although this is minor, I have missed the lunch because I could not get up. I had to ask someone to save me something. I have been through this before when meetings and training has been on my lunch time. But I wish managers would let others train me who are actually in the office. It shows no trust in others. I work with people who have been their a long time. I think it is also a control issue. I get frustrated when I am still doing the same thing day after day. My bosses manager called me one time to apologize that my training is taking too long. I think she was nervous that I would get fed up and quit. I read the reviews on Glassdoor that training was slow but not like this. I had wondered if this manager was doing it on purpose but they need me way too much. I am good at what I do. I just wish they had a more formal training structure. 

I like the office, the work an the people, but the training needs to be changed. I would think if my manager's boss called that things would pick up. Nope. Nothing happened for two weeks. I just feel like it is not prioritized."
Just starting a new job with some anxiety,"Do you guys ever feel a little too vulnerable at a new job. I’m still training in a project management position but I feel like I may not be catching on quite as fast sometimes and think that my boss regrets hiring me instead of someone else more equipped for the job. 
I assume it’s a normal thought and just want some piece of mind."
Worked for a local small business for two months and I think they're already trying to get rid of me.,"I recently got hired part-time at a local small business along with a few others. I enjoy working there, but from the beginning, some things seemed a little bit shady. 
I'm a young adult trying to save enough to be self-sufficient. I pay for most of my expenses already. When I first interviewed the manager stated I would work ten to fifteen hours a week. While the small amount of hours and pay would make living more difficult, I agreed. I'd just cut back on unnecessary spending. 




So for the first two weeks, aside from one day of training, they never scheduled me, then gave me one four-hour shift in the next two weeks. Since then they've only been giving me eight or nine hours a week. I got my paycheck, and there was no training wage in it. I thought that was odd, but decided to wait and see if the mistake would be resolved the next check. It hasn't, and on top of that, it says I've only worked eight hours this whole year when I know I 've worked more. 




There's a lot of other weirdness too. I applied to be a cashier but they don't let me use the cash register. When they say they need people to cover shifts, when I volunteer, they suddenly don't need anyone. I just got a text from the manager telling me and a few other workers that we suck (her words.) I work hard and while my personality isn't all bubbly and bombastic, I'm friendly. I'm going to wait a few more weeks and see if the weirdness all resolves itself, but I can't shake the feeling that they don't really want me. I don't know if this is normal for working part-time in California, and I'm afraid other places would be worse. I just don't know.


TL;DR Got a job, got way fewer hours than I was told, no apparent training wage, not allowed to use the cash register despite being a cashier, and boss suddenly got kinda mean."
trade school or accelerated training ?,"I am currently in taking apprentice classes in both HVAC and Res Electric, first year for each. My school offers a 10 month ""accelerated program"" in New Home Construction. 

&#x200B;

1. The Apprentice classes are 2 days a week, 3 hours a day for each with light hands on training in the shop. 
2. The accelerated program is 5 days a week, 6 or 7 hours at an off site location, hands on training at a Habitat for Humanity home construction site.

My issue with the apprentice classes are that they are PAINFULLY SLOW. I am switching careers, not starting school for the first time. I have a degree and worked in the corporate world for a few years and then decided to switch and pursue work in the trades. I am not working currently and living at home in order to take these classes, and to find work in the field after time, I am 28 years old. 

The appeal of the accelerated program is time it takes to complete and the almost 100% hands on training. 

The con of the accelerated program is that its not specialized, not plumbing or HVAC or Electric or finish work, its all ruff labor work, putting up frames/roofs ect. and its 5x the tuition... 

Will working in home construction LEAD to specialization and/or good skills or would I basically be busting myself for a quick career that wont have too much progression ?

Anyone here work or have worked in rough home building? did it teach you anything that you used to progress to bigger and better things? did it open doors? 

Has anyone here worked as a tech in electric or Hvac or something else? Did you wish you started off with something different or are you glad you went the specialized route ?

Thanks!"

"New Cashier Here, Just Had a Shitty First Day at Work. Read On and Please Tell Me This Gets Better.","TLDR: First day. Thrown on reg without being able to study produce codes in a busy supermarket. My spotters could barely speak English so many of my questions went unanswered. Berated all day by customers (even the nice ones commented). Awkward set-up of reg counter causes agony in the lower back after a couple hours, took the bus home instead of walking because of the pain. Am I being a baby? I'm used to busting my ass (former waitress), but at the moment I'd rather physically run headlong into a truck than show up for work on Wednesday.


EDIT: Sorry for the length, really had to get that out.


Hello all! Today was my first day at a busy local supermarket and it was god awful: I mean, it's my first day so I didnt expect things to be perfect, but damn.

Anyways I came in and was handed 5 pages of codes that I had to memorize (plus an additional 50 more since mix nuts is self serve now). I was nervous, but knew I would get it down with repetition and would have some time to practice before I had to do anything too challenging...or so I thought. Without any time to even glance at the codes I was put on a register while an experienced cashier spotted me. It was okay in the beginning since the morning was slow, but everything started to fall apart once the rush(es) started coming in.

People would come through with carts filled with produce, most of which I didnt know the codes for, so I desperately tried to memorize all these codes as they came at me, but I struggled all the way through. My spotter got to the point where she basically was just telling me all the codes without letting me try to memorize because she got annoyed. About 80% of the customers I had were talking shit, and even the nice ones just had to say something to my spotter about me being new. Also, I should mention that the two people I was bouncing between all day speak really broken English so a lot of my questions weren't understood or were misunderstood. 

I was simultaneously told to slow down and take my time (probably had to call my manager 10 times today because I was anxious and hitting the wrong keys), but also felt a huge pressure to speed up because the place was packed, the lines were getting long, and I know I was slowing things down. One of my spotters was asked by a manager how I was doing and I told her to be honest; she said something in Spanish about my speed and the manager wouldn't translate for me.

I'm afraid what this job will do to my health. The cashier counter is set up in a way where you have to lean forward to be able to reach product and scan it or else you will hit the conveyer belt button. Within my first hour and a half my lower back was screaming at me; I was able to rest it during my breaks and lunch, but it wasnt long until it started up again. I was able to walk to work since it isn't far, but today I took the bus back home because I was in so much pain from leaning all day that I couldnt walk without hunching over. I also know carpel tunnel is a problem with cashiers and one of them was telling me how she had to get surgery for hers; this didn't help her and only made things worse. If I'm in agony after one fuckin day I'm afraid of what will happen to me in a month or two. I've been getting into running lately and I dont think I can run with pain like that.

I am finding this extremely demoralizing. I worked at this place as a courtesy clerk from 2014-16 and left because the workplace politics were toxic and the managers were in on it. Years later I have had to come back because the job I took afterwards asked way too much, but refused to hire the proper amount of staff to handle the workload (still did it for 2 years though). The job I took after that one hired me full time only to have me (and everyone else there) work only several 4 hour shifts a week and sometimes you only got one day for the week. I looked for full time work, for months, but NO ONE is hiring for full time, so I eventually had to come crawling back to this place; seeing that many others I worked alongside years ago are still here in the same positions makes me feel trapped and hopeless.

It just sucks you know? I messed up and was forced to go back to a toxic environment to help make ends meet. I resigned myself to it and was looking forward to saving up money to finally get started on the next phase of my life, but it's worse than I imagined and I cant afford to leave. Even if my back ends up shot and my nerves frayed, and my self esteem beaten into the ground I have to do this. I dont mind being a cashier, but I'm not suited to this environment. I feel like I'm being a whiney baby, so please, tell me its going to get better.

What's it like working at a thrift store?,"Young guy here, I've always worked construction after graduating HS. Never worked retail or any other kind of job. Have 80 hours of community service I need to do starting tomorrow. I assume it's pretty straight forward, unloading donations etc just wanted to know what people's experiences have been like."
Week 1 of training and I already want to quit,"Hey everyone! I just finished my first week of training for my new job and I am feeling really unsure about all of this. I am training to be a fisheries observer in Alaska, and am currently in Seattle for a 3 week training. This is my first job out of college and being this far and isolated from my family is really difficult. The training is very rigorous (12 hours/ day) and has a high fail rate. I am living with 5 others in the training class (apt. Is provided by company) and I feel like I’m not really making friends. Our teachers say that the training is the hardest part of the job, but I’m afraid that once I go to AK I’m going to hate it as much as I hate this training. Does anyone have any experience with this job specifically and/or training difficulties? Did things improve once you finished training?"
When is it acceptable to ask for more work?,"Hi all! 

I began my job about a month and a half ago and it’s going well. I’ve had a few hiccups here and there with easily fixed mistakes. My job has a 6 month probation period which is fine. 

My boss is really hands off. She showed me a bit of the ropes my first few days and I was off to the races. If I have questions, I learn as I go or basically teach myself. The biggest hurdle for me is learning the process of how things are done.  

The problem is..... I get bored! There’s been a lot of times where I’m sitting at my desk *finding* things to do and making it up as I go along. My workload isn’t enough, I could easily handle double of what I’ve been given. 

When is it appropriate to ask for more responsibilities or tasks to do?"
Trade school or academia?,"Hi guys i'm 28 and torn,
I have done a few years at a university switching majors around until eventually i settled on Psychology. I did enjoy it quite a bit, I don't know if I see myself as a therapist, but I've been told by many friends I could be successful as one. I realized what interests me the most is the Neuroscience field. I've been on hiatus from a university for about 4 years now and have been working since.

I worked as a restaurant line cook and even did a year of a culinary program at one point because I thought I enjoyed cooking enough to really learn as much as I could. I realized though, I no longer want to work in the restaurant industry. 

I currently work in the manufacturing field. I've wanted to explore jobs that are more hands-on just to earn a solid paycheck and maintain hobbies outside of work. Recently, I've been turned on by the idea of trade school. I know that renewable energy jobs will be on the rise in the future and i've considered going to an electrical program to learn about renewable energy. Renewable energy is something I've always felt inspired by ever since HS.

Being a morning person has always been a struggle for me (unless I retrain myself to do so), and I realize that a lot of trade jobs start work at the crack of dawn. 

As far as the Neuroscience field I could see myself being a researcher, maybe getting an M.S to become a Neurologist. There's a lot of really cool things Id like to continue learning about in the field of Neuroscience and Psychology. Id probably enroll in a community college to bring my GPA up so that I can get into the best state school here.

So thats my story, id appreciate anyones input."

Stressed about new ice cream job,"I just started training, this is my first job. The job is pretty much nothing like what I expected it to be. I really liked this place as a kid so I was excited to work there. The place is very messy, despite what customers see. You are expected to work alone and the manager is pretty much never there. It is empty 90% of the time and you just have to sit there and wait for people to come. Most of the people who come in look they read way too much Yelp, and they can be very rude.

Ice cream out of the freezer is very stiff and with my weak arms I can barely get it out, although I only tried once. I don’t know how to use the register and am worried about making coffee and milkshakes. There’s so much to learn yet they expect you to do and learn everything by yourself. Training barely helps because there are almost no customers to use as examples. And you don’t even get paid for training!!!

I feel so worried about this and I’m not sure if it was a good choice, but it was my dream job. Tomorrow is my 2nd day of training. Any tips/advice?"
Questions to ask on first day?,Is there any basic info that would be useful to know or anything you wish you had known when starting a new job?
Annoyed with training new coworker...am I being unfair?,"I work at a makeup company that has gone through a lot of changes in the past month with multiple employees quitting, leaving me as the only copywriter with double the workload. As background, I am the social media copywriter responsible for all the social media captions, giveaways, YouTube descriptions and everything related to online presence. Meanwhile my boss - who just quit - was the Marketing Copywriter and wrote product descriptions, sales, ad copy and more. However, I would often help out with her duties so I'm trained on all of it.

This week they hired a new Marketing Copywriter with 25+ years of experience, although none in makeup or e-commerce. I was fine with this and figured she would be a big help to me, until I found out I had to train her since I'm the only copywriter left in the company. 

It's been an absolute nightmare. I've tried my best to explain the work to her, but she just isn't getting it. She keeps asking the same questions over and over when I've answered them multiple times, or asking about things that aren't even relevant. ""Why can't I see this copy in the email?"" ""Why does it do that?"" ""Is that right?"" She also has no clue how to use technology. She straight up asked me how to start a new document on Google Drive - which is how we communicate at work - and doesn't understand the concept of sharing files. She doesn't understand Basecamp, Slack, anything.

Even when it comes to writing she's pretty mediocre. For instance, a recent sale had a theme of sparkly makeup and summer and she asked me ""How do we write it with a double theme like that?"" This woman has been a copywriter for as long as I've been alive, so I don't know why I'm the one giving her writing advice.

I really don't want to sound bitchy because I know she's trying, but training her is adding to my already huge workload and I feel like she just isn't getting it. My main questions are.... is it normal for me to be training her? Like I said...she's 48 and has been a copywriter for two decades while I'm 25 and have been one for barely a year. Shouldn't a manager be the one doing the training? It's gotten to the point where I'm having trouble finishing my own work and am constantly interrupted by her questions. Is this normal? Am I just being bitchy? What should I do about this?"
How to speak and write smoothly and articulately in both English and Russian and become employable?,"Hiyah. I'm 22 y/o Russian native guy. Just came back to Moscow after studying for 6 years in US Florida, and I kinda speak fluently both languages, but not really. Today I lost a Russian job offering on a really good position because my written test assignment had too many mistakes in Russian, which was ""unacceptable"", said by HR manager, who I agree with. I haven't practiced my Russian outside of chatting with friends and family members and I guess it's become a lot rougher. I mostly do everything in English now, but even that isn't perfect. As a non native speaker I have a lot of issues with pronunciation, accent, and word choice.

I would like to polish both languages and become employable, so I'm trying to organize my thought process and what my next steps should be. I'm going to start reading Russian literature, so as of today I'm picking up Dostoevsky! And for English, I need to read a lot more books too, and the area I'm lacking the most is speaking, so I need a lot of practice on that too, but I'm really unsure on how to do that in Russia. Maybe finding and hiring English native/fluent, public speaking specialist, but I don't know.

I don't have great education or experience, so I would like to sell my fluency in two languages as a skill to get some experience in corporate environment. I can't really do that if I can't prove it. I feel like a mess. I want to get my career going. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts, thanks for your time :)"
"Please HELP! My new job lacks organization, structure, and training. How do I discuss the issues with my employer?","Let me preface and say that I'm currently in the processes of changing my career field. My background was mainly in business and merchandising. I did exceptionally well in the field, but it wasn't fulfilling nor was it my true passion. So, a few years ago I decided to make the big leap and pursue my true calling in life- Nursing! I completed my pre-reqs as of June and I'm currently in the process of applying to different schools. I wouldn't start my program till the beginning of next year, so in the meantime I decided to start an entry level job position doing administrative work in a clinical setting. I was hired as an executive assistant for a behavioral healthcare facility for kids and this past Wednesday was my first day. I was so excited because I also have previous experience working with children and want nothing more, but to be a pediatric oncologist one day! This job would be a great way to get one's foot in the door!

The tasks of this job are nothing new to me. Create a marketing plan, make travel arrangements, purchase merchandise for facilities, schedule and conduct interviews, and support front desk as needed.  No problem I thought! Boy, was I WRONG. As mentioned, Wednesday was my first day on the job. 9 AM - 2 PM.  I arrived on time in the morning and the executive assistant (Helen, we'll call her) whose job I would be taking over greeted me. Helen is going on maternity leave in October and she is the directors right hand. The director informed me that she would be out of town for the week and that Helen had a wealth of knowledge to provide me. So, I expected lots of information and training from Helen.

My first day consisted of a tour of the facility, introduction to some staff members who were there that day, and brief information. I was then plopped in front of the computer to schedule interviews for various job positions that I didn't know much about. Helen assured me that I had everything under control while she left to support the front office in another room. I went  through the notes Helen provided me and realized that she didn't cover many things. What were the candidate requirements? Did they need a college degree? Certain amount or type of experience? Any certifications? What did the various job positions even entail?  Also, Helen was allowing interview walk-in's based on the previous emails she sent. Something I have not seen before. So, I made a list of questions and went to ask Helen. Helen was unclear and short with answering my questions. She looked annoyed with me and it was apparent that she didn't have many if any requirements for potential candidates. Also, the information on the various job positions were very brief. So, I went with the flow and tried my best to send interview requests to people I thought were best qualified.

The second half of the day, I was asked if I was comfortable interviewing the walk ins. I said no because I still didn't have a good grasp on what their expectations were as far as qualified candidates, various job details, and interview style they wanted. So, I took notes by shadowing Helen, the HR manager, and HR assistant as they conducted interviews. Well, what I learned was that although HR & Helen had similar interview styles, they had very different expectations on who is qualified for the various job positions. When I asked about this, they went back and forth with one other and came to no conclusion. By the end of the day I was confused more than ever and had fragments of information coming left and right. Helen then told me she would not be in tomorrow, Thursday. Nor would she be in Friday. She expected me to continue scheduling and conducting interviews, assisting front desk as needed, create a marketing plan, and request quotes for customized merchandise. Helen assured me that I had it all under control and that the scheduler at the front desk would be helping me out on my second day. HR would also assist with the interviews and if I needed anything else that I could text Helen questions. Before leaving that day I asked Helen to email me further information I needed. She agreed.

Thursday and Friday were complete madness. Two members of the staff had emotional break downs in the front office. One kept threatening to quit and ultimately did the same day. The other was the scheduler who showed up late and had received bad news the previous day. People kept calling trying to get in contact with the scheduler and were frustrated that she wasn't returning their calls and I didn't have the information they needed. So, instead of the scheduler helping me on my second day, I was helping her while she took constant breaks leaving me alone at the front desk. Then, I realized Helen didn't give me all the passwords I needed to access certain accounts and information. Nor, was I told where certain documents would be or materials in the office were stored. One of the front desk phones was broken on top of that.

Next, I had walk-in interviews show up throughout the day and that's when I realized just how crazy it was that they have open time frames where people walk in for interviews. In addition, Helen evidently did not have any of this under control because she was making errors such as interviewing the same people twice. Furthermore, no one ever knows who or when they are assigned to conduct an interview. HR could only help me to a certain extent and I found out they were asking interviewers illegal questions. So, not only was I more confused, but also falling behind completing my other tasks. As a result, I had to work off hours without pay to finish these other tasks.

Helen wasn't answering important questions through text and there were constant delays in whatever she did choose to respond to. On top of that, she failed to email some information to me that I requested Wednesday when I left the office. She then proceeded to argue with me that she did in fact send it to me. She did NOT. While trying to get quotes for custom merchandise on the phone, staff was yelling and screaming in the front office. Instead of working till 2 PM for Thursday and Friday as I was told. I ended up having to stay till 5 PM as requested the last minute because things were crazy. Therefore, I didn't have much of an opportunity to take a break because of the madness and had not brought lunch. I nearly fainted on Friday as a result of overwork and failure to take a break. HR manager was not understanding at first when I was fumbling over my words, until I nearly fainted. I let HR manager know when they came to check on me afterwards that I was very unhappy with the lack of structure, organization, and training. He didn't offer much of a solution and left for the day shortly after.

To say I was livid would be an understatement. I'm an individual who thrives in fast-paced detail oriented environments. But, this was absolute madness and I've never been more at a loss for words. The clinical assistant (Carrie we'll call her) informed me she was aware of the issues with the center and would request a meeting from the director next week when she comes back. Carrie let me know that the HR assistant and herself were also struggling with similar issues and that she did not want me to quit. So, here I am glad not to be alone, but questioning what on earth I just signed up for. I really want to make this work because it's not only a great opportunity, but the mission of this facility aligns with the values I espouse. I know there are many ways I can contribute, but I'm not willing to share my connections and sacrifice my health for a business like this. What is the best way that I can convey all of this to the director in the meeting next week?"

"For my job interview, my boss gave me $8000 and wants me to deposit it into my bank account, then transfer over to another company, is it common?","I applied for this job as an office assistant, and my boss told me he wanted me to do several tasks as a test. One of which is he sent over an $8000 check and told me for helping out I could keep a couple $100s, then send the rest to another company. 

I think it's incredible I literally just semi-joined, and he's trusting me with that much money, esp how certain potential employees could probably just run off with it. I normally want to keep a decent reputation if I can so I don't and also just out of personal values, but I haven't heard of a job interview doing something like this as a test, is this a common thing? Should I be wary or is it totally legitimate and okay? I looked up the company and they have a website and all and seem pretty legit, so was hoping to grab an opinion? "
Weird Work Environment/Internal Hierarchy Seeking Advice,"I have been working as a data analyst at this company for 4 months. There was no proper training (first red flag) and I’ve been “on my own” for the most part struggling to learn. 

The weird part is most days I’ll have 1-2 hours of work tops, some days I legitimately go through the day with no tasks and leave at 5. I beg my 4 person team to give me more work and teach me more so I can help, but they’re always busy. The most senior guy on the team who is also my manager doesn’t communicate much with me and often stays till and past midnight to get work done yet never delegates to me. I also feel they know I’m sitting here doing nothing, because 90% of my work gets passed down from the team. 

I know they need me because they wouldn’t have hired me, but it really feels like it I leave there will be a huge burden put on the team. However, what is so confusing is that I don’t really do much day to day so I don’t see how this is possible from my POV but in reality they need a 4th on the team.  

I have a great salary for my position, 1 year out of college. However, I really am not learning at all nor growing as an individual because most of the company is much older than me and there’s a sit and get your work done type office vibe. 

Part of me is like wow your getting paid fairly well to surf the web, learn about real estate and Amazon FBA... milk this as long as you can. People who work 60-80 hours weeks making 10-15K more would kill for 9:30-5 (actually leave at 5) for my salary. On the other hand, I hate not doing anything and feel this is slowing down my life’s progression and know I do not want to be here long term. 

TL;DR

My small team doesn’t delegate work to me even after asking numerous times a day. I’ve almost stopped asking at this point. Any advice would be helpful."

Is the Skills Gap a Myth?,"A recent SHRM article, written by a professor in the field, argues that [“The Skills Gap is a Myth”](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/1217/pages/the-skills-gap-is-a-myth.aspx).


His arguments confronts the claims that U.S. businesses are having a tough time finding and hiring qualified people because of factors like universities inadequately training recent graduates for the workforce.  He responded that such claims are exaggerated because employers, that used to provide training to new employees (especially in entry-level positions), have been cutting training budgets and are expecting new candidates to come in already trained for the tasks specific to their roles.  This was especially common during the recession when there was a surplus of seasoned employees competing for entry-level jobs.


 As a result, these entry-level positions, that used to serve as starting points in a career for recent graduates, now require multiple years of experience.


The author argues that universities training students for specific job roles is incredibly inefficient because of the rapidly changing demands for different skills in the job market:
>One problem with trying to get our educational institutions to produce the students employers want is that there is no guarantee that anyone will hire them when they graduate. Telling young people to major in, say, petroleum engineering, which was among the hottest jobs this decade, turned out to be bad advice when demand fell off. It’s also incredibly inefficient to try to learn work-based skills in a classroom setting.

5 star upscale restaurant barista," 

My manager had come up to me ran by me a couple of questions he has asked me If I I was in school and whether or not I had another job. My answer was no. He offered to give me forty hours, something that a lot of people would be grateful for. He had asked me If I wanted to do the coffee position at my job. I use to work at Mcdonalds and making drinks use to be fun so I thought that this would be a nice opportunity for me. I had agreed to take the position but that I only wanted to work 30 hours, that way I could move up or down in hours depending on how I felt while working the new position. He was upfront and told me that I would only have my trainer for one day and that I would be all on my own from there. I saw that he had put me on the weekend and the trainer said that it gets really crazy with coffee and Im scared for the weekend because I know the servers are going to be frustrated with me because its going to be super busy and I will be slowing everything down for them.

It was my first day working the restaurant side of my job today. Usually I stick to banquets. Throughout the day I had been following my trainer around and one person that I know from banquet said ""cmon guy"" in response to me not knowing the table numbers and not knowing where to drop off the coffee and It was this comment that made me feel awful. I just cried. This is because I am not able to take criticism. I wasnt sure if I just needed to sit on the idea of telling my boss that this isnt the position for me for a day and get outside advice. The thing is that the coffee guy only makes cappuccinos and espressos but I still struggle with working the machine. Theres a certain part that we have to take out and then put a new one in and I can never get to put the regular coffee in. Not understanding simple concepts is something not new and I believe that my anxiety has something to do with it.

My manager had asked me how was the first day and he was on already on his way out of the restaurant and I just didnt really know how to tell him how I felt because I was very scared. I would have felt guilty telling him that I was uncomfortable and that I didnt think the position was right for me. I was going through some scenarios in my head but none of them I thought would be perfect. I had to prepared to answer what do you need? Can you give it another day? What is stressing you out? You had already agreed and your on the schedule. I thought about being vague and just keep repeating that its not working. I thought about telling him how Im scared to death of people. I thought about saying It was good, I just dont know how to make coffee. I just told him that it was okay, I was just thrown out by the numbering system that we have so we know whose tables are whose. He had brought up something about needing a map, I think it was a joke but its important interactions like these where my anxiety just freezes me up and I dont hear what the other person is telling me. He was feeling good, and kept coming out of the office with all of my tips from the previous days that I have been working, had his backpack on and I would have just felt too bad to tell him any of this."

Frustrated about not getting a work term,"I just wanted to rant a little bit, and let out some steam.


So I just finished my 2nd year as a civil engineer, and haven't gotten a coop work term yet. I applied to about 80 jobs but only got 5 interviews, and no offers. Getting no offers really sucks. It seems like my confidence lowers everytime after an interview. One interview that hit my confidence was an interview with the city of Edmonton. They were looking for 2 students and interviewed 3 people (including me), and I still didnt get the job. It really sucks.


I've been going to my university job office for resume/interview help, but still had no luck. Even before going for help, I realize the biggest weakness I have compared to other students is my lack of work experience (ie. I have no work experience at all). I thought that grades were everything and dint focus on getting any experience. And it's a mistake in my part, and probably should have tried to look for jobs during highschool, but no point in regretting in the past. 


With my lack of work experience, I have been volunteering and joined an engineering club to compensate for the lack of experience. With those, I gained amazing memories, but it still doesnt feel the same as getting a work term. 


I feel like a part of not getting interviews is my interviewing skills. I generally don't have very good experience with talking to people, but I felt that most of my interviews felt really good (only 1 interview felt unprepared). But I guess that wasn't the case since I'm still looking for jobs. 


Since the first work term started today, they waived my first work term since they saw I was actually applying to jobs/put some effort into looking for jobs. However, if I don't get a job in my next work term, I'll be dropped out of coop. Furthermore, the experience I hear from my friends about their first day, makes me really depressed since I cant partake in the same experience.  Also since about 90-95% of civil students got a job makes me even more depressed about it.


Being dropped out would kill me inside. I worked so hard during my first year since I needed a higher GPA to apply for coop, but I feel like that was just a waste if I end up being dropped out. In addition, if I don't get a job for my coop, what are the chances that I get a job after I graduate? Thoughts like this scare me. 


At this point, I kinda accepted the fact that I'll be dropped out of coop, but the future terrifies me. I basically don't see a future in what I do right now 


Thanks for anyone that read my rant. Hope you guys have a great day."
"With LinkedIn Learning growing so much the last few years, what kind of weight does it carry on a profile or resume?","Personally, if I was a hiring manager and I saw that someone completed a bunch of learning paths, they'd peak my interest because they have continued learning even after they've achieved a college degree.

In the end you are learning skills that give you advantages over others. It's only fair to list it, right?

I'm wondering if anyone has had experience with hiring managers thinking high or low of these, or if they've completed these learning paths and if they've created an uptick in profile views/messages?"
Best job for simpletons?,"I am someone who struggles with instructions, needs a helping hand or trainer wheels whilst beginning, and lacks qualifications in pretty much every role including a shelf stacker."
Discrepancy related to work recertification course?,"I've been at my current workplace for 16 months, and there are several trainings we are required to complete an annual recertification course for (around every 12 months). My workplace consists of 2 different buildings with the same trainings administered by different staff (we'll call them Building A and Building B). When I initially started 16 months ago, I was assigned to split my time between both buildings, and completed all of my initial training at Building A; however, after 5.5 months, I was offered to work full-time at Building B, and have been there since the last 11 months. Overall, my workplace consists of frequently being short staffed due to mismanagement, miscommunication, inadequate trainings, low salary, burnout, etc. I have been searching for another job with a better work atmosphere, but haven't been successful in finding another job yet.

During one of my initial trainings, the training was supposed to taught for 3 full days, but ended up being taught for only 2 days due to a snow day happening that week, and subsequent time constraints at Building A. Despite the ""shortened"" training, I felt fairly well equipped with the presented knowledge, and passed. I was initially supposed to complete my recertification of this training 4 months ago, but due to the backlog of trainings and disorganization of my workplace, they decided to do my recertification just last week, after 4 months past the original ""deadline"". The recertification course is intended to be a 3-4 hour course summarizing all of the training from the initial 3 day course that's taken when you first start with the company.  I completed the recertification at Building B (since I now work there full-time), and have been noted to have several deficiencies, which has significantly caught me off guard, especially since the trainings are supposedly created to provide comparable information at both buildings. It is also noted that this training is not completed by my department supervisor; it is by another coordinator within the workplace.

The overall recertification training was only completed by 1 instructor at Building B (no other instructors agreed to show up to assist with the training, leading to mass confusion about recertification training expectations, improper abilities to fully teach material, etc. When I completed my initial training, it was done with 3 instructors present for additional feedback also, etc). I have never completed a recertification course before, and felt that the instructor heavily criticized me in front of the other trainees, and felt that the training was ultimately a very demeaning, humiliating, and discouraging experience for me, which I did not experience with any of my initial trainings at Building A. I also have not been noted to have any other deficiencies by my supervisor related to my job duties, etc.

Given that I completed all of my initial training at Building A, I am not sure if deficiencies are being noted because the trainings really aren't ""standardized"" like they should be between both buildings and I did not learn everything I initially should have, if it's because my shortened 2 day training really should've been a 3 day training when I initially took it 16 months ago, etc. None of my coworkers  or other colleagues have had a recertification or initial training experience like this. I spoke with my supervisor about this situation because I truly feel like a ""failure"", and she assured me that this is a result of errors and inadequacy by the training department that are beyond my control, and that is not my fault. My supervisor also mentioned that there seems to be ongoing issues of training consistency occurring between both buildings also. I am planning to meet with the instructor (with my supervisor present) to discuss my recertification training performance, as well as my previous training experiences, but am overall still feeling like a failure and really upset about this situation, even with 16 months of experience at my job.

Has anyone ever dealt with a situation like this, and has any advice they can share about this situation?"
How to cope with adopting a mess of a job,"So long story short one of my coworkers was fired and I was placed in her position (education and experience lines up and they were disbanding my department) 

I pretty much adopted a mess. Things were put off/ignored and never done, things weren't done correctly and since my predecessor was fired, I did not get any training in this position. I was placed and my other coworkers are fantastic eith helping me but theres only so much that they can really provide me given it's not their position. It's been a week and I've been stressed out to the point of being sick about 3 times. I cant keep doing this.

Point of Sale (POS) technician,"I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to do this on so please let me know if it isn't.

I remember reading somewhere that you need a Network+ cert to get into it, is that true. I know Microsoft has this cert called the MB6-897, will that prepare me for it?

"I got a job but have no previous experience, trying to learn but it’s hard","Originally this job posting asked for at least 5 years in administrative experience. You know how many I have? 0. None. I still got the job.

I think I only got it because I was an intern at this organization for 2 summers. I only applied for this job because I didn’t think I could get a job anywhere else. I wasn’t actually that interested but felt like I had no other choice. I spent the last year sending out job applications and only one interview. Well, two including this job.

But since I have the lack of experience, they kind of expect me to do things I have no knowledge about. I’m not being thrown to the sharks, but I’m really not confident in anything I’m doing. This job is completely different from my internship, which was all research-based, and I didn’t have to talk to many people all day, which was my favorite part.

It’s just all really new to me I guess. I also have horrible social anxiety and that doesn’t help. the people there are sort of helpful but my job is different from their job. I’m supposed to be the expert on this stuff and I have no expertise. I just feel lost, but maybe I should still feel this way since it’s only my second day of work.

I just wanna know if anyone has had experience practically being thrown into doing tasks that you didn’t know much about and were basically told to “figure it out yourself”

"If I fail a job training and got fired, is it the end for me?","Good day! I will take this opportunity to mention that this post will be a bit of a text wall. Also, I will be completely honest here. All opinions, insights, and advices will be welcome.

QA - Software Quality Assurance

So I am an IT person with 2.5 years of IT support work experience. I pursued a career shift to QA because I wanted that ever since before graduating from college. After six months of being jobless and countless interviews, I finally landed on a junior QA role. I was so happy about landing this job...

...until the training session began.

Basically, the purpose and goal of the training is to learn about three company-specific tools, and the endgame was to develop a working system using these tools. I was motivated at first, until the trainer began to inform us that if we fail the training, they'll have to ""let us go"" (it wasn't his intent to scare us in the first place though).

When I heard that, my motivation...became fear. So I had to learn them all by a bit of ""force."" (I was able to learn the use of these tools properly though)

Our training session only has two weeks overall, I am currently at the last week of my training, and we are now developing the system on our own hands. Most programming languages used in these tools aren't thoroughly discussed, and we had to use Google to even begin studying for it. In the first place, developing a system from scratch wasn't my forte, so I experienced so many difficulties coming from here and there, to the point that I am beginning to feel shy asking questions to my teammates.

Not to mention, the training session is still in the process of being improved. There were many VAGUE requirements and data dictionaries. We had to figure out the rest, according to our trainer. The two-week pressure was too much, and we had to resort to overtime just to finish one module from another (this OT is not paid and is not approved as an offset). Heck, we even had to sacrifice our weekends just for this.

The final day of my training will be next week, and I am already anticipating the results. I am particularly slow in developing a system, and I felt like I will fail the training.

Fast forward if I fail the training: I was thinking that I will need to put that company in my resume because they had my government numbers for taxation purposes (in our country, almost all companies required our government numbers). I cannot lie in my resume because it will just make situations worse when applying for other companies. 

So I was thinking: Am I complaining too much? I tried my very best, but everything becomes overwhelming for me. I would feel ashamed of myself if I only lasted in a company for less than a month and got fired because I failed in training.

Again, I would appreciate any advice, suggestion, or insight. I will try my best to respond to your post. Thanks again and good day."
"Other HR representatives/receptionists, have you ever been insulted over the phone while trying to setup interviews? How do you respond?","(Also sorry I’m on mobile for formatting) First time this is happening to me today. An applicant had two phone numbers listed on their resume. I called the first one, person asked who it was, when I responded they immediately said “ugh” and hung up. I figured maybe the person had the incorrect number so I called the second one. Second person asked who it was, responded with the same information and before I could say we received their resume they said “suck a dick” and hung up. I went back onto the website and it was the correct number. I’m assuming both the numbers listed was the applicants and their spouse. So I’m not sure why they insulted me when they were the ones who were trying to apply to the job we listed? It’s not as if we called them a week later or so after they applied. I rejected the applicant afterwards, sent them a rejection email, and reported them on the website itself. Not sure if I should be changing the way I answer? I usually start off with “Hi is this (name)?” Then I say who I am, the company I’m with, and that we received their resume for our position. Should I start with something else? "

Is learning coding/programming as useful as it proves to be?,"I keep seeing posts about learning how to code and program and wonder if it's as useful as these posts make it seem. I have in interest in learning different things and I don't mind learning how to do this type of thing, but it is really as much of a useful skill as it seems. Is it really a highly sought after/employable skill? 

&#x200B;

Like I said, I don't mind putting in the time and effort to learn it and see if it's something I'm interested in and can do for a (short term) living and job, but I am also curious on the demand for someone with that type of a skill set. 

&#x200B;

If it IS an in demand skill set, what can you do with it and what should I be doing to help myself learn it better and come off as employable? I know I'm going in blind, so any help would be useful. "
Maybe I'm under qualified?,"I graduated from university with a math degree 3 years ago. Got my first entry level job (business intelligence related at a small company) for about 5 months. It was a great opportunity for me to show my soft skills. Next job was at a big company, did that for 10 months (analytics and sales related). Most of the team I worked with was very junior and I never felt challenged. Next job was in business intelligence as well, lasted a little over a year. Got promoted after the one year mark. It was a startup and my soft skills were challenged but my technical skills weren't really a problem. It was a small team so I could learn as I went along. Once again, most of the other team members were quite junior and were less skilled than me.

&#x200B;

I left the last job and took on a data engineering role at a large company. I am now on a team of about 20 people, all of whom have substantially more experience than me. They knew before hiring me that I was a more junior person. This was one of their reservations. Even I constantly reminded them of this. I told them I was a quick learner and I suppose they believed me. I've only been there one day, but I am definitely the weakest link on the team and I worry that while they do know I have a lot of technical skills to learn, I feel they don't know how much I don't know. I never lied about my skills during the hiring process. But all of my other colleagues know high level data engineering/architect concepts that I have never once used. Moreover, this role behaves like a software developer. While I am familiar with the basics of agile and the development process, I have absolutely zero experience with a development lifecycle. For the first time since I can remember, I am at the bottom of the food chain and it is quite intimidating. I do believe I can learn, I just worry it won't be at the pace they expect.

&#x200B;

Has anyone else been in a situation like this before? It might sound a bit silly to say this, but I feel I have almost progressed too quickly in my career. In 2 and a half years, my income has increased by 210% compared to my first job. I worry that at this pace, I may breakdown, fall apart, crash, etc. I am not the most functional person (I suffered from depression for many years, can't get out of bed sometimes, can't fall asleep, etc.), and I worry I might fall back into my old habits. Has anyone experienced something like this, and what did you do to keep yourself on track?"
I suck at my new job,"I work two days a week at a grocery store in the deli section (cheese shop). My first day was June 25, but I'm still struggling.  I work the morning shift at 8:00, so I'm supposed to check the sell by dates of stuff in the cooler and refrigerator section. I've been trying really hard to be thorough when checking dates ( I'm supposed to done by 10 but I've gone over that time). I'm still missing stuff that supposed to be pulled. I try to jot down on a small note book things that are going out of sale soon but my list isn't long enough ( before I was writing things that were going out sale in the first few days of the week) My cutting and wrapping is still too slow. I'm not learning about the cheeses fast enough. Last Monday I was there by myself until 12 (this was the first time) and I was really struggling. It took forever to find to find the cheese I was supposed to cut. I  ended cutting the wrong thing. I didn't have a sample set out. Anxiety was really kicking in at that point because certain cheeses go well with a preserve topping and others don't. I wasn't sure what to pick and over thought the whole thing because I was worried about making another mistake. I delayed my lunch break and tried to cut as much possible to not leave my co-worker with a lot to cut, but still I didn't cut enough. Technically, I'm on my second warning before my boss has to talk to management. I'm trying so hard but I can *feel* myself sucking and struggling. I try to ask for help when I need it but I'm not improving fast enough."
How to keep my cash drawer in balance? HELP!! (Bank teller),"So I’ve been working at a bank for about 2 1/2 months. Been handling transactions for about 2 months. For some reason I can’t seem to balance. My bank has a rule where anything $3.00 and under doesn’t count against you. 

Anytime I’m receiving cash or giving cash, I always count it to myself out of the drawer, count it out loud, run it through our counting machine and count it out loud to the customers. I also track everything I receive/give to the customers onto the computer. 

For the past couple of weeks I’ve been at least short/over 3.00 and it’s super frustrating!!! I do everything I’m supposed and I somehow still end up with my cash drawer being out of balance :(

I am struggling in my new job and making constant mistakes because no one trained me. I feel like a failure.,"I feel absolutely depressed and I don't know what to do anymore. I've been in this new job since October, I came to this department highly recommended and the managers fought to bring me over. It's a brand new job that I have no experience in but I guess they decided that since I excelled so much in my previous departments that I would just fit right in. They trained me for about 30 minutes my first day then immediately thrust me into making big decisions and doing big projects. I've done good jobs, but I've also done some bad ones that have had a lot mistakes. 

They are very nice about it and have admitted several times that I'm making mistakes because they dropped the ball on training me. My supervisor had a meeting with me and said that I came at a bad time when the department was swamped, which is why nobody trained me. But I still feel like a failure. I'm still making mistakes and every day I get discouraged further with every error that is brought to my attention by my team leads. 

This is really affecting my morale, I find myself questioning my abilities and wanting to leave this department. But they still insist on keeping me for some reason. I don't know what to do."

Tips for making an employee training program?,"So I have the opportunity to basically design the training program for my job position (we have about 6 technicians nationally and will probably increase to 10, plus the constant turnover anyways), and I have some ideas. However, i dont really know how to design an effective program and wondering if anyone has tips and/or useful reading on designing them? This is a technical job with several skills/knowledge topics (electrical theory, networking, mechanical design, hydraulics/pneumatics, etc.), several equipment, and a couple softwares to learn, just to give an idea what kind of training program."
Everything seemed wrong,"Has anyone felt so useless when they're off to work?

I just joined this new company barely three weeks ago including on job training. And was informed this morning that work for the past week or two weren't up to their expectations.

To add on, they were looking of extending the training period to an additional month or two on top of the initial 4 weeks allocated.

My point is, I'm barely a month here, just start to find my ways or even the policy in place to work and yet was shared I'm not up to standard? The last job I had lasted me over 5 years where I felt drained. And now moving to this company, I thought it'd be better but ended up worst.

My role is basically drafting responses and emails to Organisations regarding the legal aspect or some policy in placed. So the kind of questions I'm asked to deal with varies. They acknowledged that the learning curve might be steep but they are like solely blaming me for my shitty work. Weekends are here and I have 15 over cases just for today and the sla is two working days.

If I take too long to respond, they'll see me as slow and incompetent. If I submit it on the same day, they see me as someone who couldn't care less. I'm really lost at this... I would want to have a good career and prospect just like the one I had before this. But no..... Things are not looking bright."
Halted training advice,"I work as an independent contractor editing from home. I have been with my main company for 5 years. I wanted to make more money since we are buying a house, so I applied to another company. Being an IC, I don’t have anything in my contract that says I can’t have multiple jobs. My supervisor even said she didn’t care as long as I wasn’t bad mouthing main company. I love it, so I wouldn’t. 
Another editor with my main company also applied and started at the new company. Main company then starts talks about possibly moving us to employee status. Other editor quits new job and tells them she is being made employee at main company. 

Now new company doesn’t want to continue training me because of what she said. Conflict of interest if employee at main company and IC at new company. Thing is...there is no guarantee we are being made employees at main company. If we are, it won’t be for a while. 

I’m really upset because we just bought a house, and I wanted extra money to get some things fixed. I tried to explain to new company it’s not a for sure thing (which is true...again, just ideas being tossed around) and wouldn’t happen for a long time if it did. The director had emailed me and asked if I was an employee now with main company.

Don’t know what else to do to try and save this job. Any advice?"
Starting new job (internal) - How can I be more effective in learning?,"I'm feeling a bit nervous. I am not expected to know everything, but I am expected to learn quick and perform well. It's giving me a bit of anxiety because I've been doing my past role for 8 years and do it in my sleep. This will be taking me out of my comfort zone.

What advice would you give me?

My concern is also asking too many questions and annoying people. Is there any way to diminish someone from being irritated by the new guy?"
Is it ever appropriate to ask for a day off during your training period?,"I just got a job in the bakery department of my local grocery store. The store's training period lasts 6 weeks. I have a doctors appointment this week (that I can't reschedule), and I am 3 weeks into training. My manager has me scheduled to work alone the day of the appointment, which means my department will be vacant for an hour. I have to take a 30 minute (unpaid) lunch break, and I'm thinking about talking to my manager to see if she would extend that break (which I am allowed to do, according to the handbook). Is that appropriate, or would trying to trade the shift or even asking for the entire day off be better?"
How do I get trained for the job that I want?,"So I've been working at a law firm as a receptionist for the past 7 months now. It's been great, but when I started I was told there was a potential for growth as a paralegal. I was excited, knowing that being a paralegal could mean a better pay.

But honestly, I've learned that I'd much rather stay in the office management side of things, rather than being a paralegal.

I've been being trained in anything they can teach me to do, mainly because I pick things up quickly and I want to learn anything and everything I can to better myself and my resume.

They've given me some tasks that have me work with one of the paralegals, but some are done with the office assistant. She's on top of her work for the most part (from what can I see), but she's getting up in age. She is well past retiring age, but she'll probably work until she literally can't anymore. I'd be more happy to help her with more office upkeep work than to be a paralegal. 

So my question is, how can I steer my training towards office work and less towards being a paralegal, if at all?"
Starting Over,"Greetings!


I’m a 34(m) currently working as a freelance comic book cover artist living in the US. Got my permanent resident card a couple of months ago but I’m not planning on continuing in this industry for much longer. 
I have a high school professional diploma in graphic design however, this is something I really do not enjoy doing and, whenever I get recruited by some agency it always has nothing to do with what my resume mentions.
Anyways... Going straight to the point, I’ll be pretty much homeless in a matter of months if I can’t find a job that pays at least 30k a year. Doing all my budgeting, this would be the bare minimum I could get to “survive”. It would obviously depend on city/state since 30k in SF is absolutely nothing, but kinda doable in Seattle. (I currently reside in Florida btw). Does anybody have an idea of what sorts of jobs can I find that allow me to basically live by myself? Right now I’m just trying to go through all my options. I’m good with my hands and I’m confident I could put them to very good use with the proper training... Just don’t know where to look or where to start.

Thanks in advance!"
I started my new job today...,"It's absolutely terrible. I'm sitting here crying as I type this and just hoping any kind soul out there will lend a sympathetic ear and some words of wisdom. 

I've been unemployed for a few months. I have a good amount of money saved and it wasn't too big a deal. I quit my last job and made a big move across the country, so it was voluntary. Last week, after a while of searching, I received TWO pretty exciting job offers. I waffled between the two jobs for days. Job A was a job in my chosen career path, low stress, okay pay. Job B was slightly different from the path I've been on, medium stress and great pay. After much deliberation, I decided to accept Job B because I thought it might be exciting and to be honest, the pay was enticing. 

Today was my first day. First of all, the job I trained for today is not really the function I was told I'd be hired for. I was offered what I thought was an office position. However, today I shadowed the C.O.O. all day on a job site, being trained as if being on site would be my primary position (using language such as ""you'll be doing this"" and ""when you are in charge of this""). It ended up being an 11 hour day. I wasn't given a restroom break. I didn't have anything to eat or drink all day and even though I thought I was taking a white collar job, I spent much of my day doing labor tasks. Also, I'm a young woman being given a somewhat rowdy crew of men to manage out the door on my first day. 

The person who trained me today texted me just now telling me to come in even earlier tomorrow, almost guaranteeing a 12 hour day and I just don't even want to go. I feel terrible, but I want to just crawl in bed and turn off my phone. I feel like I made the wrong choice and I wish so badly I could go back to the day I turned the other job down and choose the other path. 

Sorry for the whiny rant, I'm just exhausted and upset. Anyone out there have some wise sagely advice on how to keep going after a horrible first day on a new job? "

I work in an engineering role that is very technical. I started work at a very busy time and got thrown into a very poorly managed project with a very tight deadline. I have recieved mininal training, and it is hard to ask my coworkers for help and it hampers their progress towards our short deadline. I did well in school and at my internships, so im not used to being in this spot. Im trying my best but im getting discouraged with how difficult the project im working on is. I recieved much better training at my internships and i feel like i am set up to fail here. 

Looking for some words of encouragement or advice.

What to expect and prepare for in Training,"After looking for a job for a while I finally start training for my new job tomorrow. They have what I consider ""Formal"" Training because it's at a different facility going over procedures/policies/etc and then the following week I will be at my assigned location getting more hands on training. I've only ever had Informal training/hands on. Would anyone have an idea of how to prepare for this kind of training, what to bring besides the necessary paperwork and what to expect?.          I'm going into this feeling slightly unprepared and very nervous. Would appreciate any insight on this topic."
Hi I'm from Michigan does anyone know how to prepare for tabe Test?,Yeah I took the tabe test. Past the reading portion need to be brushed up. On the math section I only get two tries in a year. Is there any timed test. Or ways to be ready for it. Things that help you pass it.
Should I call and ask to be sure what time my orientation is?,"I got the call about a week ago letting me know I got the job and my orientation date, I just can't remember if she said 7 am or 8 am"
How do I make sure I will succeed in my first big boy job?,"Thanks to all your advices reddit, after 4 looong months of constant search and disappointment, I had finally received an offer from my dream job!

I had never had a full time job and pretty much have only had retail experience, so I am very nervous and truly want to perform well in my new job, especially since my boss had decided to match my salary expectation with a pretty significant increase because he says he sees the potential in me. 

I am super eager to learn and I really want to do well and not disappoint anybody. 

I want to hear some stories from you guys, how have you prepared for you success in your first 'real job' and make sure you are learning things at a good pace? I would also appreciate any tips!!

Assembly Line first day tomorrow???,"Anyone who's worked on an assembly line before, what was your on-the-job training like? And did it go well?"
"New employee - 2 weeks in, training is going too slow. How do I ask for more work/training?","I get the feeling my boss/coworkers don't have the skills to train anyone.

I work in an office job.  One of my core responsibilities will be paperwork.  I'm 2 weeks in and they haven't started ""teaching"" me about the paperwork that is so easy it's self-explanatory, and instead have me doing almost nothing.  I'm over 30, speak 3 languages, have a degree, and years of experience in another professional field so it's not like I'm slow.

I want to do the paperwork, and asked the guy who is supposed to train me if I could get a copy of some old data to practice filling out paperwork.  He didn't, so I asked him again later, and asked the head of our entire branch before we went home.

This job pays better than any job I've had before, by a significant amount.  I like the staff, and the job has the potential to be interesting, but they're going at a snail's pace."
Stressed with lack of training,"I work in Software Implementation.  I have been with my new company for almost a year.  The software is very complicated and I was told I would get 6 months training at my interview, but in reality I only received 10 weeks.  They are now putting me on projects where I am implementing new customers from scratch, and I feel like I am in way over my head.  I have emailed my line manager my concerns but he hasn't done anything about it.  I worry about it every night and it's really stressing me out.  I'm thinking of calling in sick next week because I have some training to do that I know I won't be able to deliver.  What should I do?"
Being trained... but looking at leaving,"So I need to know if I'm being a bit of a dick to my company, I am currently looking for a new job closer to home to half my commute and lower my costs, but my current company is spending money on getting me certified on forklifts.

I cant say to my boss that I'm looking for a new job or else I'll just get it owed for everything but at the same time I'm costing them money for this training and I might get a new job within a month."
Unsure what to do about new job,"I started a job this week as an parts/inventory clerk for an emergency automotive company.

The company seems great, my coworkers are nice, but... it’s been 4 days now, and I’ve received exactly 0 training on my job. I keep asking, but my boss is extremely busy, and the person who’s supposed to be training me seems like she actively dislikes me and refuses to do anything, preferring to stay on her phone all day.

Just... I have a lot to learn about this job (I only have inventory background, but not with car parts and stuff) but it feels like there’s no support structure. I want to learn and do well, it seems like a really great job and the pay is good and I enjoy actually supporting emergency vehicles, makes my work, however small, feel like it helps.

What would be a good way to voice my concerns without throwing people with tenure under the bus? I don’t want to be fired for this type of nonsense twice this year. 

Or should I just coast on this job till I find a new one?"
How to negotiate: looking for book recommendation,"I'm looking for book recommendations on the topic of learning how to negotiate successfully. 

While negotiating salaries for women might be interesting for a side project, I'm mainly looking at how to negotiate with contractors to get the best deal available while not alienating them. My biggest issue seems to be to be either a) too modest woman or b) too aggressive in negotiating, going for an all or nothing approach. I think I need to learn to to get more professional.

Thanks a lot for your recommendations."
Boss keeps saying she’ll be here soon to show me things and leaves me for hours,"So it’s my third week. I still don’t know how to do 90 percent of job because my boss keeps saying she’ll show me things soon and then it will be hours before she comes over even with me checking in to see where she is (when I do check in on her, she says ‘I’ll be over in just a minute’ or ‘over in 15’ and then doesn’t come for hours so I start to feel annoying and like I’m burdening her). When she does eventually come, she usually just gives me busy work and doesn’t divulge in or educate me on my recurring responsibilities that I have. Now, I’m imagining that when she tells me she’ll be here in ‘just a minute’ she actually goes back into her office and laughs about leaving me with nothing to do for hours. 

How do I handle this situation? Am I supposed to teach myself? I told her that I need to know the contacts and and general info for the newsletter in order to put it together and she says she’ll sit with me but my god it doesn’t take 2 hours to send an email. Is she bad at her job or am I bad at mine? There’s no one else I can go to to ask."
Training/Certificates to boost resume,"Hello, I have a question that Google has failed to answer (maybe I'm just asking it wrong) and I was hoping someone here could help. 

I'm a recent psychology graduate and I want to get into grad school except all of the schools I want to apply to require so many hours (or years) of work experience and I'm struggling to get a job in the field. I was wondering if there were any training courses or certificates I could get to improve my resume and make me a more competitive candidate. When I say courses I mean short term like a day or two (I don't have the time or money to get another degree ATM). I already have CPR/First-aid but there are so many different courses out there and of the jobs I've been applying to no one seems to be looking for the same certification. Can anyone help with this? Thanks in advance."

No training at new job.,"I'm a technician in a start up company that was created in 2015, so far in the past 2 months, I learned that there's no training or documentation of any sorts(schematics, inventory list, build of material, quality), we are financially struggling and that got my monthly pay delayed for 14 working days. I asked my family and they insist that this company is testing me for some reason I don't comprehend yet.

Is it really normal for companies not to have training or documentations?

First day of liquor store training. Any advice?,I'm about to start training for a liquor store clerk position I just applied to and have no experience working as one. Just wondering what I should expect and be prepared for. I've worked at a retail store for two months but quit due to lack of hours and never got around to cash register training. Any do's and dont's or tips to leave a good impression would be greatly appreciated.
I physically entered a retail to offer my CV. Now I have been there for a week still with no contract.,"For the first time in my life (20 y/o male) I physically went searching for a job. I’ve been unemployed after a miserable job this February. 

I found a mobile repair shop which told me to call the boss. He immediately said I could go to the shop the next day to receive training so I did, spending a good 6 hours with the only guy in charge of the shop, who showed me an introduction to mobile repairing.

Now I’ve stayed there for a week (minus the weekend) and nothing is written, no contract, not even a promise of money. I understand I don’t have a claim for it, but why should I get treated like this when I physically show initiative and hard work?

I’ve actually been working solidly. The guy running the shop hardly speaks our native language while I do, so I’ve basically been handling this shop’s customer service for a full week without any thanks.

Today he told me that if I want this job, I will have to go to our capital Oslo an hour away from where I live to go to a related store in order to receive training within mobile repairing. He made no note of salary during this time, nor if I would be guaranteed a contract if I did this training.

They say they desperately need people because the current guy working locally which I’ve been working with will leave for the 1st of April. Therefore making it even stupider that they would treat me like this.

If the skill required to fix mobile phones is so important and difficult as they seem to claim, surely they wouldn’t have gave me the chance when I specified I had no experience in the matter, right?"
What are the best skills/jobs for remote work?,"I know there’s an abundance of remote work for software engineers. I’m curious what other careers and skills lend themselves well to remote jobs. 

I know that copywriting can lead to good remote work opportunities too. What about recruiting? Any other fields?"
Non-IT certifications that will help me get a job?,"I'm currently considering a career change out of IT and into something else. There are plenty of IT certifications that I could pursue, but I just don't have the interest. So I'm wondering if there are any other certs I could study for that will actually help me start a new career.

I'm not interested in sales, and I have a bad back and bad feet/ankles, so anything that requires me to stand all day or lift heavy loads is out. Aside from those restrictions, I'm interested in hearing about any certs I can pursue on my own, in my free time, that could actually facilitate a career change.

Thank you."
What shall I do to handle a new bad job situation,"I was hired 3 weeks ago in a company, a colleague was assigned to train me, most of the times she's busy and when she has time she explains things fast , and seems to be angry when I ask questions, she told me that I need to get authorization to access the company's system and different programs, she didn't tell me who to call and how to ask for the authorization , I asked other employees and took me time to get to the right people, and then she got angry and yelled at me for getting the authorization late, she gives me things to do and when I make mistakes , she belittles me and treats me as if I was stupid, I'm still in probation period and I don't want to insult her or put her in her place, because I don't want to be fired I need the job, my manager doesn't care , he barely speaks to anyone and he doesn't bother with anyone, since the first day I asked for a desk to sit on, he only cared to tell people to give me one only 2 days ago , I'm supposed to do a report next week but I didn't understand how to do it completely and I'm frightened to ask her because I know she'll not help and worse , what shall I do to put her in her place without ruining my chances in a company? P.s it's a Korean company and that colleague is also Korean, I don't know if her attitude and behavior is normal in companies in Korea?, Is it normal to treat New employees like this to tough them up or something ? or is she just rude?"
What jobs can you train for at nights/weekends?,"I work during the week during normal business hours. Seems like it’s hard to find training or classes for other career fields during nights and/or weekends. Any ideas? I would also like to avoid careers where you could spend a bunch of money/time on classes or training without much of a guarantee afterward, been down that road before. Any ideas would be appreciated."
How to get started in the PC/tech repair field?,"I've been considering switching careers. I think a phone/PC/tech repair job might be something I could enjoy though. I have had and used computers my whole life, and am generally good at looking at issues and troubleshooting. My experience with hardware itself is lacking, but I have enough cursory knowledge that I think I can pick it up with some training. My OS knowledge is pretty limited to Windows and Android at the moment though. I have a bit of programming knowledge (python, C#, Java, GDscript) but only on a very basic level. And my GoogleFu is strong. What paths for training are there? Would starting out with a corporate outfit like Geek Squad be a good way to get training?   "
Spend $120 for forklift certification? I have no job skills and am partially mentally disabled.,"Richland Community College in NE Dallas is offering a 2 Saturday class, 9 hours total, for forklift certification. I have no job skills, and I just lost a simple job after a short period due to mental dysfunction. I still collect SSDI/Medicare. I am not of sound judgement. Maybe this work is too dangerous for me. I have about $1400. I'd like to get my teeth fixed, and get some trauma therapy. But yeah, $120 is a good investment. Military service, Level II Security License, Forklift Certification. If I become homeless driving my father crazy, this is a good way to land a job, and low wage jobs often add $5 or so to the hourly wage if you can drive a forklift. My problem has always been holding a job.

I hate making eye contact with anyone, I avoid the potential for intimacy by not being around women, I fear authority figures, and my working memory is absolute shit. I might have to explain to my next employer that it took me 20 years to realize I had been molested before puberty."
"Recently got a new job, but training has been painfully slow","Hi all, 

I recently got a new job working in production. I had my interview months ago and signed all the necessary contracts and papers to be an employee, but currently I have been waiting around to hear which gigs I can shadow on to train. I want to ask my boss to accelerate this process as I need at least three training days and I've only been on one. I really need this job to pick up quicker than it is, but she said that she'll keep me mind when a suitable shadow day comes through. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any advice about how to approach this without coming off as rude? I am really at a loss as to how even word the text. 

&#x200B;

I'd want to say something like, ""Hey \_\_\_, I know that you are looking for appropriate days for me to train, but I really need to start working in the coming weeks. Is there anyway to put me on the schedule next week for training, so I can start as soon as possible? Thanks""

Suggestions are appreciated.

"Employer paid for training, applying for another job","My employer paid for me to take a series of classes between May and this month that led to me getting a few certifications.  They spent about $12k total. 

Since then, a job opportunity popped up.  I've been looking for jobs for years but it's rare that I find something this specific to what I want to do that doesn't require me to move or commute over 3 hours a day, so I applied and now I have an interview scheduled.  It's not a sure thing but I think I have a really good chance to get an offer.  

What are the ethics here?  If these jobs were common I'd probably wait a year for another one to pop up but there's no guarantee that would happen.  I've been with this company for over 10 years.  "

Quick advice needed about sending an email to new boss,"I'm still in the training phase and am now moving onto the on floor training for a week. This is a part time job thats supposed to be for 3 days bit the trainings are occurring 5 days a week. I emailed the director yesterday (who handles initial training and first schedules) about how i'm done with the administrative part and would like to move onto on the floor. 

She told me to come in tomorrow (today), friday saturday mon and tues. I have mentioned previously to literally everyone in HR that I have a second job and need to be aware of this before hand to handle coverage etc. Additionally because I took off for a week at work already its harder to find coverage because I left then hanging for a week (annoying because they weren't even sympathetic enough to let me take off for my dads surgery). 

I'm at my 2nd job right now and genuinely cannot work until MAYBE Sunday at the earliest and have mentioned to the person dealing woth scheduling that i had weekends and mon/tue even for training because unfortunately my other job has become a little inflexible. 

I did send an email yesterday, telling them my dad is in the hospital and would appreciate to start on sunday/monday because he'll discharge then, but she never replied and would like feedback on how to approach this now..."

Coca Cola job posting… more info?,"Coca Cola is hiring in my area for *Logistics Operator II*. the post doesn’t explain if training will be provided but it states that a forklift , pallet jack, jack stand, glad hand locks, and yard dog will at some point be used. none of these listed i have dealt with in my job experience. does anyone here know if training is provided on site after being hired? i would assume so, but it’s not stated.

Tips for learning how to drive a forklift?,"I've had previous experience using an electric jack and a walkie stacker but never a forklift that you drive. I started a new job and told them I was interested in learning how to drive one. The very first day they let me get on one to try it out but I had an incredibly difficult time with it, particularly turning the forklift so that the prongs fit underneath the pallets in the bin.

My question is, what is the best way to turn it in a precise matter? Is it better to just come at a pallet almost perpendicular like a ""T"" and do a 90 degree turn THEN go forward, or are you supposed to turn in one fluid motion? I think it's awkward for me because I'm used to a car having a moving front axle, not a rear axle. I kept turning too early and it was INCREDIBLY embarrassing, as the other 3 guys that were with me training seemed to have no trouble at all driving and moving palettes. I ask because I will continue trying to learn it and I don't want to keep embarrassing myself each time I try. Would love to pick it up much more quickly if anyone has tips."
New role in the banking industry. Looking for training advice,"I'm starting a new exciting role with a very large international bank! I start within the next few weeks.

What types of links or readings can I study up on to get a better handle on the banking 'business'. My background is in IS, so I'd like to become more banking/financially literate before I start. Any tips are helpful! :)"
How do I go about asking my supervisor that I want to take on more responsibilities?,"I currently work at a radio station that only has about 10 employees. Most of the employees are much older than me, with the exception of the part-time employees.

I’m going back to school now in an unrelated field, but I’d like to have a backup plan. Maybe working in the office more, or at least seek out a job that’s in an office setting.

What’s the proper way to ask my supervisor that I want more responsibilities? "
I keep making mistakes at my new job and am taking a long time to complete my work. How can I take more ownership of my performance?,"I started a new job in a corporate office about 4 months ago and have been working in my field for 5-10 years (i.e., not a newbie). My first month here was spent training, and, afterward, the person who trained me has been on a sabbatical for the last 3 months (and will continue to be so for another 2 months), so I've basically been on my own since that time.

My team's work is pretty siloed, and each of us work on our own projects without much overlap. In other words, my teammates aren't very familiar with the technical details of what I work on, although there is some overlap with some of our more general job tasks that everybody on the team is responsible for. My boss says that if I have questions on my projects, they would be the most knowledgeable person to go to. 

Onto my problems. I am basically making mistakes in my work, and, so far, I've always been the last person to complete their work amongst my team, sometimes going a few hours over the deadlines. When I started this job, my boss said they are looking for someone who can work independently. I feel like I can work by myself, but it just takes a very long time for me to find the answers when I look independently. I can go to my boss and ask questions to make things go faster, but I feel like lots of my questions would be very basic things that would make my boss ask, ""The information's right there. Why are you asking me what to do?"" I can work independently, but it just takes me a long time to find the relevant information I need. I also don't want to keep bothering my boss with every, little question I have, and I feel like I have a lot.

I'm also naturally a slow learner and need some hand-holding with new tasks (whereas hand-holding seems to be frowned upon these days). There are still a lot of things I don't know about my projects, lots of what I feel are basic things, like how they work in general. I feel like this is because my trainer didn't have time to train me on everything before they left, and my boss often tells me to just look at previous examples to try and recreate what they did. This leaves lots of gaps in my understanding about my projects since, while I can recreate the work, I don't really understand what I'm doing.


I feel like my boss is now starting to lose confidence in me. They continue to accompany to meetings about my projects and has started leaving me reminders about my job tasks on my calendar. (When I started, my boss told me they don't want to be have to remind or keep track of his team's detailed tasks and wants them to take ownership of their own projects.)

My team had most recently completed our most critical time of the year, and I made my boss stay late at night since I was the last person to finish my work, whereas all my teammates had completed their tasks and left for the day hours before I finished my work. I was finally able to complete my projects a few hours after our deadline, whereas the rest of my team was able to meet theirs.

My work quality was also not good since I was rushing to complete my work, and, sure enough, the next day, another team pointed out errors in my work, ones that I've made before. Once I have a chance to review my work in more detail, I expect to find more errors. My boss did not seem upset at me when the other team pointed out my mistakes, but I think they were starting to get a little irritated.

I think more frequent check-ins with my boss might be a solution, as well as explaining the situation, that I'm having a more difficult time onboarding since my trainer has been out the last 3 months, but how else can I take ownership of my performance?"
Can you get into tech support with no experience?,Is there certain minimum things you would need to know?
Why exactly are new hires made to learn so fast for?,"As far as I know or the norm of it there is this thing known as probation and it usually last for 3 months. During this time the new hires are supposed to take the chance to learn mostly of what is to be learnt and are not supposed to be someone good, and especially for those entry level hires 3 months is not even sufficient due to lack of experience. So when people are expected to get moving on their own after like less than 3 months I am not sure why exactly."
"Don't know how to approach getting schooling, training or maybe even a mentor?", I'm 32 year old male from Michigan. I have been working in produce for  about 9 months. Took a test just recently I passed the reading. Just  need to be brushed up on the math. If I want them to pay for schooling.  Don't even know where to get started? My testing said I was  enterprising. Just seems like everything I want to do. Takes four years  and do not want to be in debt. With apprenticeships seem like there  physically demanding. I'm type 1 diabetic and do not. Want to bottom out  while working. I mean I like the idea of trading. Which would be cool  if I had a mentor. Analysts perhaps I feel like if I'm the best I should be making. The money to show for it. I mean wondering where the future is going. And how to tap in on it. Skys the limit any ideas? 
"When you first started working, how bad were you at making professional phone calls?","I'm at an internship rn and I feel like I'm so bad and awkward on the phone. It improved since I started, but I still feel like I stutter over my words, I don't sound legit, maybe I try too hard to sound ""customer service-y"", and people don't really take me seriously. Sometimes there's like awkward pauses on the phone where the other person is trying to process what I just said because I probably said something dumb. I always say that I'm an intern at xxx organization so I don't represent my org badly. Just wondering if other people here were like that when they first started and if it improved with practice?"
Help Approaching Boss for Development,"I need some help with figuring out the next move at my company. 

I've been at my current company for about 2.5 years.  When I was first hired on, it was so I could help the then project manager expand this new business line.  Long story short, that manager ended up being very hands off, and I ended up being responsible for leading the team, handling meetings with client, facilitating the manager's meetings, and doing the actual technical work.  The PM was fired and replaced, team shuffled, and throughout all of this, the company owner made it a point to tell me how he appreciated what I was doing, and that he saw me evolving into a partner at the company.   

Around this time last year I had to move departments to fill in a vacant position, and everything shifted at this point.  I got little to no interaction with the company owner or other managers, and when we did interact the dynamic changed.  Managers now talk to me like I'm an entry level employee without the benefit of anyone checking in on my status or progress.  I've tried to be patient over the last year and learn more in my new position, but nothing seems to be changing and I'm starting to feel like I'm needed to fill this role, but I'm not a valued member of the team anymore.  

The actual request - I'm going to approach the boss in the next few weeks to discuss what opportunities there are for me in the company, and/or what he thinks I need to work on to get to the ""next level.""   What feedback do you all have on how to approach this conversation?  I don't want it to come across as I'm complaining for being a forgotten employee, but I do want to get the message across that if no one checks in on me while still treating me like a younger employee, then I have no tools to succeed and/or progress.

I passed my OSHA exam with a 70% exact. Does my percentage matter to say other jobs/employers?,"I'm not honestly sure how to feel about my passing of the exam. I want to feel proud but am disappointed with my score at 70% exact. I went on over a 6 hour streak today to get to the exam and finish it before returning back to work in the next few days. I spent 22.5 hours in total to get to the exam. I feel highly proud of how I did on the quizzes but the exam is what got to me. I got 70% for my first go at it but felt I could have got much better if I had either given myself a break from since waking up getting all the quizzes out the way or just not have rushed through it in a sense during the final exam. I wish I could re-take but hey, I'm just fucking glad I got it out the way at the least as I was told to have done before returning from break. It was a originally suppose to be an OSHA 10 hour General Industry but with my added electives and such, it came out to 17.5 hours estimate. All in all, over 22 hours it took.

Unrealistic pressure on myself as a new-hire?,"I'm an exec assistant and just transferred from one department of our company to another. I was with my previous team for two years and I was a \~rock star\~ over there. I knew how everyone worked and was able to manage my six executives and team of \~70 on my own, which really impressed my new executive in my interview. I was hired with this team almost 3 weeks ago, and I feel like I've been *so slow* since my first day.

Granted, I haven't received any form of training with this team. I was basically thrown in to it from day one, and I feel like I'm learning how my new executive works by her telling me I'm making a mistake or doing things wrong. I'm really struggling with this learning curve, because her working style is a complete 180 from what I'm used to with my previous team, and I almost feel like I'm starting from scratch or having to rewire my brain and unlearn what I'm used to. I also feel like an idiot because I'm having my mistakes pointed out to me constantly. I was told that I was hired because they knew I was a great admin and that I could handle it, but I feel really discouraged after having mistake after mistake pointed out (which is really just preferential stuff of my current exec vs. my previous ones). 

My previous execs would essentially give me a long list of things to do, and then leave me alone to do them + answer their phones. My new exec is *extremely* hands on, requires a lot more ""assisting"", remembers exact conversations and things she asked you to do from two weeks ago, and likes everything to be a certain way. She will ask me questions about her calendar or meetings I've scheduled as if I have her calendar memorized, expecting a quick answer, and then I feel like a flustered idiot trying to remember what her meetings are or when I scheduled a specific meeting for.

She's SO nice and everyone tells me she's a great leader, but I can't help but feel like I'm falling short of their expectations of this ""master admin"" they hired. I think she's used to a level of service that her previous admin provided (who was with her for a few years) and I'm just not there yet. However, I feel like a learning curve for just changing departments within the same company shouldn't be this difficult. My friends tell me to cut myself some slack, that it's only week 3 and that I wasn't trained, but I also feel like it really shouldn't be so hard for me to grasp, especially since I technically do know how to do everything.

Anyone else in the same situation or have any type of advice? I feel like I'm putting unrealistic pressure on myself because I'm so used to being able to handle everything, and that just being ""new"" is hard for me, but I can't help it when I'm constantly being told I'm doing things wrong or not being ""proactive"" enough when I never really needed to be before."
Why do HR people get so put off when you ask what the position pays but think it's fine to ask what your salary is?,"This seems backwards to me. I think I'm underpaid for what I do - everybody does, I know - so disclosing my current salary puts me at a disadvantage because I know I'll be offered less than what I'm seeking. 

I've never asked anybody how much they make. I've always thought that's a rude question. Unless we're married or I'm applying for a loan from you, it's none of your business. 

Last time I had phone screener, I countered the question by asking what the salary range was. She wouldn't answer. Another time, I revealed my salary and she said the company could hire me ""at a bargain."" What the fuck? She basically admitted that they wouldn't pay me market value. 

Why is it accepted for recruiters to ask for your current salary? What ways are there of avoiding the question without coming off as rude?"
Retroactive pay cut?!? Is this legal?,"I work a retail job where I had been on salary working 4 10hr shifts/week. I am currently the only employee. On 5/20 I got an email from my boss informing me of a ""company wide change"" that effective 5/15, there will no longer be salaried employees and my hours will be cut to part time.

Is this legal? I know that bosses can cut hours and the like, but I don't see this retroactive stuff being ok. 

I want to quit tomorrow when I go into work, but I don't know if I can demand my appropriate prorated pay based on my salary.

Advice please!!!!"
26yr old just got a 50% raise by almost quitting job for another offer,"**I somehow got a 50% raise at work.**

I was offered another position doing similar work, but with better pay. When I informed my boss that I was leaving for another job, they asked me to wait a day to get a counteroffer approved.

The next day, the head of the office offered me a new title and a 50% raise from **60k to 90k** as my base salary. 

I did also just finish my MBA, but did not expect this big of a raise this quickly.

Just wanted to share this story as an example of how much of a raise you can get if you have some type of leverage, such as another job offer. "
Was told I was getting a raise. 4 pay periods later I still haven't seen it. Not sure how to proceed.,"I work in a hotel as a sales manager. I've been at my current property a little over a year. When I was hired I had no sales experience but over the course of the year I have met and sometimes exceeded my sales goals.

I was desperate to get out of my old job so I accepted an offer with a slightly lower base salary then people in the same position in my area. I gave myself a year and if I was doing well in the position I was going to ask to be compensated. I did research before my review and saw that the sales manager at the hotel listed directly below us in tripadvisor rankings was making $3000 more than me. I took this information into my review and stated my case. I was told that not everyone was getting raises this year but I had definitely proven myself and my GM told me that I would be getting one. I asked for a specific amount and he said he would have to discuss that with his bosses.

I waited 2 pay periods to see it on my check and there was nothing. I asked my GM and he gave me some excuse but assured me that while it would not be on the next check it would be on the one after. Said check came on Friday and there was nothing. I am not sure how to proceed today. I feel like I am being taken advantage of because I haven't raised much of a stink.

On a side note, getting my bonuses has been a pain in the neck as well. I have to continually pester and ask and they come months after the fact, so much so that I have lost track of which months I have been compensated for.

Any advice would be appreciated."
Salary Issues,"I’ll keep this short and sweet! I’m currently finishing a year training program in which I was paid $35,000 (I have a 4 year psych degree where I had a 3.81) and was just promoted to branch manager. I’m responsible for an 8 million dollar a year revenue office and have full management responsibilities. I’ve taken on a huge workload and work a minimum of about 50 hours a week. I was just told today (been with the company a year) that my raise was to $36,500. Unfortunately the amount is non-negotiable. Is it time for me to go or should I stay? I feel this isn't even fair for an annual increase let alone a promotion. I do have 2 internships under my belt prior to this position.  "
Did I just screw myself with my response about salary requirements?,"Hey all,

So I just had an interview with a large company and it went great. I was referred to the position by a friend, and I knew going in that the starting salary for this position was $42k (I'm currently making $32k). During the interview, the recruiter asked what I'm currently making now and what my expectations are, so I was honest and told her I'm making $32k currently but I don't think I'm being compensated enough given what I do at my current job, and I'm looking for ""at least $40k."" I didn't want to give her a huge number above my current salary because I didn't want to seem unrealistic. Do you think $40k is the max they'll pay me now? Or since it's a corporate company, they'd offer the starting salary of $42k?"
Salary Negotiation,"I'm in a rather unique position and I'm hoping someone out there can offer some advice.  I've never negotiated a salary before so I've been doing some research on the subject.  Everything I read says to know your value in the job market.  

Here is where my dilemma begins, I am in a highly technical field.  I am lucky enough to have become one of, if not the top person in the field.  This has led to my latest job opportunity, and subsequent salary negotiations.  

Now my research efforts on sites like Glassdoor have not been very successful.  I do know my skills are very high in demand, and very few if any qualified people exist to fill those positions.  I have about a 5 year head start on any competition and I really want to try and capitalize on that.  My issue is no one has any published or community based information on salary ranges.  Trying to link up a few other close careers to mine have yielded very different numbers.        

I already have the upper hand walking into the negotiations, however I don't want this lack of information, arguably the most important information, to be used against me.  Will I be insulting to HR and my new management to begin negotiating very far to the right side of the pay scale?  I'm talking in the range of 30k to 40k more then what I would normally expect.  Without any baseline numbers it is hard for me to even estimate where to begin the negotiations.  

If anyone has been in a similar situation, or been involved on the other side of the table in these types of negotiations any advice would be most helpful.            "
Negotiating salary at a startup--what to expect? [x-post r/personalfinance],"I've just finished a long and very involved series of interviews for a startup sales position. This is a total career shift for me, but I have years of experience in another field that will translate very well to this position. I should find out next steps next week and want to be prepared in case I'm given an offer.  

Looking on AngelList and Glassdoor, I'm estimating salary would be between $50-75k (likely toward the lower end). Right now I'm making $60K and am hoping my next position will start out around $65k.  

My questions are:  

* If I'm given a lower offer than expected--say, closer to $40k--would it be inappropriate to counter with a number as high as my current salary of $60k? Should I be upfront about wanting $65k?  

* If I'm asked to tell them what my salary requirements would be, how do I avoid low-balling myself? Could I hurt myself by coming in too high?  

* I've been reading many articles about how equity works at startups and I'm still not sure how this might factor into an offer. This startup finished a very successful Series B funding round earlier this year and is in a period of rapid growth. I've read different things about how this will impact equity and salary offers.  

Any insight or personal experiences would be helpful. I'm moving into this world from the nonprofit sector and this is all brand new to me."
Honest opinions on earning 14/hr fulltime?,"I'm graduating college in a week and have been offered and accepted a full-time job with a nonprofit that pays 14/hr, 27k a year before taxes. This job is in a social work field so I wasn't expected a high salary, but after talking to some friends they seem to think 27 is ridiculously low and it's making me nervous. I don't live in a big city so rent is not outrageous (hour outside of Denver, CO), and I will be living with a roommate. I've never known much about finance or budgeting, so i'm having a hard time grasping how living on 14/hr will really be. Will I be able to have any spending money realistically or is all my income going to go to bills?! I'm stressing a little.
Any advice is much appreciated!

additional info: the reason I accepted the position is because it is in my field of choice and will give me great social work experience (I plan on getting my masters down the line...)"
I did it! I negotiated my contract - I got a 25% increase on the initial offer + training for certs.,"Hey Guys, 

Im a long time lurker and for months i have been picking up some of your advice, so thank you for all you that contribute to this sub. I have fortunately always been employed but recently after being redundant, I have job hopped a few times and got stuck in companies that don't push me, nor pay me adequately for my skills. I work in a county that is full of smaller companies that don't appreciate IT security and infrastructure and all the big players are moving out as its cheaper to set up elsewhere. Well after months of searching, 100's of applications and 10+ interviews I finally found a company who was willing to pay me the going rate. 

I initially got offered the job but 10% under the advertised salary with promise of getting that 10% after 12 months. However I retorted that for the job they require me to do, what they are offering well under the going rate for someone in that position elsewhere. I advised the recruiter of some sources that prove this (itjobswatch, etc). I also had an advantage of knowing that they have been without that role for over 4 months and there IT was in a bad state so I knew I could play hard ball. 

Anyway they rejected my counter-offer last Friday so I rejected their offer entirely. However today I got called by the recruiter saying they are desperate for someone like me and the MD has agreed to my counter-offer plus certification training. So happy days!

So apart from sharing this with you and hopefully giving you some hope that this can be done, I will share some of my experiences:

-For those of you that have a job already, be prepared to be comfortable for as long as it takes in that role until you find one you really like.

-Don't always go for the first offer you get, weigh up the benefits, travel, extra costs, also the feeling you get from other employees when you walk around

- Be patient, some weeks I sent 5 - 10 applications and got 0 back and other weeks I sent 1 and got a callback. 

- Don't sell your self short, do some research of what others doing your role are getting paid and use that to leverage 

- Go in with 'nothing to lose' and be confident. Remember they NEED YOU, so put your big boy pants on, research the role, apply that to your current skills

- Turn the interview into a conversation, ask questions and don't be afraid to interrupt when appropriate when they are asking you questions. Try and relate these questions to what you are being asked so conversation flows smoothly.

- Do not rehearse answers to questions, get some facts about the company and research the role and memorise them but don't memorise them in structured sentences as it comes of non-genuine.

- It's OK to pass on questions you don't know - just be honest

- For some of you this is hard because you've been out searching for so long but be positive, show you are enthusiastic even if you have to 'fake it to make it'.

Temp to Perm Job -- Salary Negotiations,"So after many, many posts, and redone resumes, i finally landed with a temp agency on a temp to perm basis as an Executive Assistant/Office Manager. The pay and hours are shit at the moment due to the rate the Agency is charging. It's a small company, so the high rate is putting the squeeze on the bottomline.

That's where my concern comes in. The owner has told me that he absolutely wants to keep me on after the contract ends. However, I was able to take a look at my predecessors last pay stub (after reaching out to her beforehand, of course), and realized that she was getting paid a significantly less amount than I was expecting to get, which was really disheartening.

To be fair, from what I was told, she was very much a bare minimum person: punch in on time, out on time, no initiative (coming from other workers. not the owner). 

So I did some research on what other E.A.s and Office Managers in my area make, and the number in my head is still significantly lower than what my projected number is on salary.com (about $15k more than what I am asking).

I'm wondering if I am selling myself short on a potentially great salary. based on the size of the company, [the task I am doing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mXOCvr1ycouzDKFw5QRr_sdP3A_8SsZTeXHd8JedbrE/edit?usp=sharing) vs. [the tasks they expect](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nH72410TYYYWVxnsemT5VKhXVp3QoNQx6LjTENi-ybk/edit?usp=sharing), and the expectations of the field, should I be asking for more? Should I be prepared to walk away and find something else?

I've never been in a situation where negotiations are available, so this is all very foreign for me."
Threatened to not share any salary information.,"I had a meeting with my boss about my growth with the company. They were having a hard time finding a new person for my previous position (two people had quit after a couple days) and I said I wanted to talk about my growth in my new position since for three months and an undetermined amount of time going forward I was still performing most of the old duties. She asked me where I got the idea of ""normal salary progression"" for my new position. I said that in my initial interview it was outlined pretty plainly. She asked if I was also getting information from my peers. I (regretfully) said something like, ""Eh, a little."" Then she said there was something she wanted to discuss. When I had originally been promoted and she had presented me with my new salary, I had argued for a salary a couple thousand higher, citing my strong performance and previous contributions. I had said something like ""my understanding is that if people had been performing really well they received a bump up a couple grand higher."" She said I cited my coworker's salary as reference. I said I didn't remember saying anything like that (completely true, why would I cite a coworker?!). She asked me if he had shared his salary with him, knowing he was a close work friend of mine. After some grilling I conceded and said ""Um, I guess"". She said because of both of these concessions she was going to sit down everyone in the department and ask them to stop disclosing their salary moving forward. I stated that this placed me in a really bad position and asked if that was really necessary. I emphasized that 90% of my expectations came from the initial interview where it was outlined plainly. She said, well did only FRIEND discuss this with you? Honestly I'm bad at lying, but the funny thing is I only knew a couple other people's salaries. Mostly I just know the normal promotions and when to expect them (I thought this was a good thing, knowing the positive things to look forward to as you develop skills). It was obvious in my face that it wasn't true, so I finally cited that only an employee who had quit had disclosed his salary to me. She made me promise to never disclose my salary in the future. Somehow I feel like I really mishandled this situation by giving even the slightest previous implication that salaries were discussed. I used to work in the government where salaries were just common knowledge. I know what she did was illegal, but where does this put me now? Does anyone have any thoughts? Before this entire conversation she had told me how great of a job I was doing. But I feel like I really bungled this."
How to handle 1st round HR salary expectation rush?,"Typically my past internships and jobs had fixed rate salaries, so there typically were no need for negotiations. I'm looking for a switch and almost always HRs ask me for salary expectation which I try to evade, but then HRs push me with annoyance sensible from the other side of the phone. It could be their tactics, but I really wanted to know how I'm supposed to handle expectations as I was trained not to never reveal salaries first. Thank you."
Did I mess up the negotiation?,"Hello, 

I recently negitated my salary for an analyst position. The original offer was for 40k and they said they do yearly evaluations, so I countered with that I would be more comfortable with 45k or if that wasn't entirely possible to work in some sort of evaluation at 6 months or so.

They accepted my offer at 45k but said that their original intent was 40k with a 3 month offer so they would do 40k and waive the 3 month evaluation. I feel like I made the right call because at 3 months its hard to picture a 12.5% raise after 3 months.

Did I make the right call? I haven't signed anything yet. This is also my first job out of college I graduate this month. I just need someone to ease my worries. Thanks!"
Salary negotiations research technician?,"Edit: the posted salary was 30,000 plus doe.

I'm a clinical histotech with a BA, I'm the field for three years. Due to the work environment, unhappiness, and no prospect of moving up, I've been looking for jobs. My undergrad was in a hard science with a focus on research and I'd like to go back to that in preparation for grad school. 


I just interviewed for a position as a histotech in a research lab and I think I will get it. The only snag is the pay - which I understand. Research labs can't afford to pay as much for a Histotechnologist as a clinical lab can. After three years (Union too), I've worked up to a salary of 60K. Keeping in mind my long term goals, I expressed a range of 45  to 60 K, to encapsulate what I'm currently earning; I think I can go as low as 43,000 though. The job was posted as 30,000 plus DOE. They've been having a hard time getting qualified candidates with a histology background to apply for this position.


The PI said my range was too high and I'd really have to think about if moving to a research job will give me the benefits that I'm looking for (research experience, publications, growth). I understand this, which is why I'm not just looking for jobs in clinical histology or processing labs. 

However, according to the PI, my job isn't just a research assistant. I would be 'fulfilling an important role in preparing tissue for the other lab members who don't have time to cut their own tissue'. In this case, my technical skills are very important. 


I'm also worried that if I accept an offer that they still feel is too high, that I won't have job security. At first, I would be filling in for a research histotech on maternity leave and they're not sure if she's coming back. I would also no longer be in a union. I think they could easily let me go if my salary is a strain on finances.


I feel that, despite the benefits, 30,000 would be exploitative for my histology skills. What are your thoughts on how I should proceed?

First time negotiating for a salary. I need advice!,"So I've been working for this company for two years as a shift manager earning about 30,000 a year after tax.

I've just applied for a site management role within the company and the pay bracket is $50,000-$85,000. I have been involved in hiring and training as well as working at multiple sites for the company. I am thinking of trying to negotiate a base salary of $58k. Does this seem reasonable or am I aiming too high??

I am trying to prepare myself, as I have no experience in doing this as I've been on a wage for all my working life."
At salary negotiation phase of an interview. Not sure how much I should ask for.,"Interviewing for a mid-level management position with a well known hotel chain.

Salary is unlisted, and nothing comes up on Glassdoor when searching the company + position title (similar position titles at other hotel chains appear, but the ranges are wildly varied). Payscale is the same, with numbers all across the board.

I have no idea how much I should be asking for, and was able to stall with ""I have done a fair bit of market research into the pay range of those with similar titles and responsibilities and have decided on a range that I would be comfortable with. Can you tell me what you have budgeted for this position so that we can come to agreeable terms together?"" in the first interview when asked how much I was looking for.

Second interview is on Thursday and I know Salary negotiation is going to resume (because they told me we would discuss salary further during the second interview) but I'm not sure what kind of a ballpark to expect.

Job title would officially be Meeting & Conference Services Manager, the closest listed salary I can find within the same company is that they pay their Event Coordinators ~$50k/yr on average. Other searches I've done show that national average for ""Meeting Managers"" is ~$52k, and for ""Conference Services Managers"" it's ~$47k. Of course this is an average, and doesn't factor in location so I don't know how accurate it is.

I'd be willing to accept $45k/yr at the lowest, but I don't want to broadcast that, and I'd certainly rather be sitting closer to the $50k mark. I don't want to lose my opportunity at this position by asking for a number that's too high if their upper-limit just so happens to be $45k. I'm just not sure what else I can do on my end before going into the interview on Thursday."
How I broke out of retail & got a 6 figure salary in 3 years,"This is a personal story.  Some details have changed or kept vague to protect my identity since I work for a ""high profile"" position now.

---

First, my humblebrag: I make over $100k per year working about 20-25 hours per week for a multinational corporation in the Midwest US.  I'm officially a ""business analyst.""  In reality, I look at Outlook and Excel for 10 hours per week and B.S. the rest.

Three years ago, I worked 40 hours a week on my feet doing retail customer service B.S. at a local grocery chain.  I made $10 per hour.  I have a liberal arts degree.

Here's what helped me make the transition (in order of importance).

**1\. Learn new skills on my own time**.  When I decided that I had enough of retail, I went to the library and picked up books on different office skills.  Excel, accounting, finance, project management, basic programming, and business leadership.  For me, these were the topics that stuck.  I came home every damn night and read and practiced everything.  I continued to do this even after my first office job.

**2\. Be a job hopper**.  I found job hopping opened many more opportunities.  Yes, some people will thumb their nose at your resume, but it's necessary to advance.  I've had 5 jobs in the past 3 years (not counting the retail one).  Contract positions were great because it taught a lot.

**3\. Keep in contact with old coworkers (aka networking)**. This didn't help me get my first job, but it did help me land my current gig.

**4\. Find the path of least resistance.**  Opportunities just came up organically that I was not interested in.  I would normally not be interested in programming, but a software development position came up in my company and my boss asked me if I was interested.  No, I wasn't, but I studied my ass off and took it anyway since it was a move up.  I'm not a developer now, but I have used a lot of those skills in my current job to get some street cred with the IT/tech department.

**5\. Be willing to stay late for a big project.**  My father gave me advice once that said: be the first one in the office and the last one to leave.  This advice is old hat.  Here's my version.  Stay late for a big project ONCE, then come in late and leave early afterwards.  Once you get the reputation of the one who got that big project done, you never have to worry about being on time to work again.  You get a lot of cred with leadership who don't give a crap about what time you came in today.

**6\. Keep a good relationship with a GOOD third-party recruiter.**  Third party recruiters are a dime a dozen.  And there are some shady ones out there.  But if you find a good one, they are really valuable.  Found 2 jobs through one.

Here's been my career path:

First job: admin assistant (aka secretary) for around $25k/yr

Second job: financial analyst - looked at spreadsheets for around $40k/yr

Third job: junior software developer - built some stupid internal websites around $50k/yr (only job where I moved within the same company)

Fourth job: project manager - a much better paying admin assistant around $80k/yr

Fifth job: business analyst for around $110k/yr"
How to know your about to be fired in the IT world.,"## NOTE## Don't think of this as a bible here, more or less this is from my perspective and experience. ####

One thing that is great about IT is it's fairly easy to know when you're about to be shown the door, this often gives you weeks in advance to prepare for it and get as many resumes out into the internet as possible before the axe comes down.

One of the primary reasons for firing is the company owner is more often than not clueless about tech, and often will think of IT as a utility (sort of like an expensive electric bill) combine ignorance with bottom-line level thinking your job in IT is always hanging on by a thread; so the owner might not care you spent all weekend rolling out a dozen VM's or installing VPN's all throughout the state, and this is fine as it's also your job to educate them on that necessity, but still never be shocked when your time is up and more often than not it can be up fairly quickly. With this in mind I'll offer you some very common scenarios that foreshadow your tech demise:

1. You get a PIP

Generally this has nothing to do with your ability, more often than not this occurs due to the hours you work, how tidy your desk is, how often you travel between locations and inter-department communication; you might think these are minor things but since the owner probably doesn't understand everything you do on a day-to-day basis they tend to gauge your performance on triviality and something as simple as leaving too many Linux books on your desk can warrant a negative review. 

The first sign of trouble is the owner now wants you to consult with them on everything you do, be it how you send out emails, to where you are at all times, you begin to feel the sting of micromanagement as everything you say and every location you visit is now logged (and yes that office manager in that remote office WILL report that you got there at 11:15 as opposed to 11:00 when you said you would be there because your owner asked them to) so expect a litany of these issues on your outboarding papers.

2. Your suggestions are more easily dismissed

Remember when you first got there and the owner listened to your suggestion about purchasing a NSA2600 and a couple TZ400's to get the locations standardized and it was a done deal? But now the owner puts simple things on the backburner or you can't push much needed updates as easily and or they require excessive documentation (we'll get to this later) and approval? 

The sign here is that the owner while they still have confidence in your ability to do your job, they don't want to make costly purchases if they know you'll be out the door in two-weeks, and if this device arrives and your no longer there then it just sits in a storage closet and wastes money... No one wants to spend money on equipment if there are no operators for that equipment. 

If you notice the owner seemingly giving you the slight on recommendations that would've been a no-brainer three months ago, it's probably time to start looking on job boards.

3. Documentation Frenzy

Documentation is key to order for any organization, any good IT Manager knows this and should be updating all documentation pretty regularly; however if the owner out of the blue starts requesting a bunch of documentation such as tutorials on how you encrypt laptops or step-by-step processes on how to backup the systems then it's safe to assume that there is doom on your horizon.

Look owners hire you to do this stuff for them, documentation serves them ZERO purpose as it would serve you and your subordinates, the goal of getting all this documentation upfront and right now is so when you are shown the door the next guy to sit in your seat doesn't have to metaphorically re-invent the wheel that would slow business processes down.

If your owner asks for this, you're probably in trouble.

4. The Consultants

Every now and then the owner might bring in a consultant to help with certain IT functions that might overwhelm you such as setting up SQL databases and or some programming that is time-intensive, there is no problem with this but do understand a consultant is a double edged sword.

Consultants can't make any money unless there is a ""problem"" that needs to be solved, and often times that problem becomes you, the consultant will often tell the owner about how cheap his services are in comparison to your salary, he might bring up words like ""best practices"" and begin to cast doubt on your ability to do your job. 

Something as simple as ""the passwords aren't strong enough"" or ""The VM's aren't best practice"" is enough to cause reasonable doubt, even if under your watch there has been ZERO security risks and 99.99% up-time the consultant doesn't NEED to prove he or she is better, they just need to plant the idea in your superior's heads that A) you're expensive and B) your becoming a liability

If a consultant is hanging around longer than what would be expected for project completion, rest assured that he is whispering sweet nothings into the owners ears about how his company can do SLA's at a 30% discount; since businesses are bottom-line this is poisonous to your career.

5. The passwords, and the end of you.

Every now and then the owner might want a password or two for a few systems, this is pretty normal as a owner might want to see all the folders on your shared drive and a domain admin account makes sense for that. 

But if you come in one Monday morning and suddenly the owner wants the passwords for everything, the Wi-Fi, the anti-virus, the VSphere, the help-desk and anything and everything in between, then rest assure that you'll be boxing everything up by the end of the day.

The moment you start handing over passwords is the moment a hired consultant is on the other end changing them as fast as they get them, and within the hour you can count on your administrator credentials being nuked from the system and you can't login to anything... Feel free to take extra-long on that lunchbreak because the moment you return you'll be greeted by a powered off computer and a HR rep asking for your keys.

So what now?

The good news if you see the signs you can better prepare, and don't dwell on it too much. IT is a large field with a lot of demand and supply it isn't uncommon at all for entire IT departments to be swapped in and out year-to-year, you have a blessing of working in a high-availability career.




"
The nicest rejection I've ever gotten.,"Hi r/jobs, 


I just wanted to stop by to vent and share my experience.  I have been on the job hunt for about 10 months; 4 months unemployed and VERY actively interviewing, testing, and (as the title implies) getting rejected. 


I just finished the process of interviewing for a position supporting the Superintendent and Board of Trustees of a small, public school district.  Long story short, it was down to me and one other candidate.  I ""knocked [the first interview] way out of the park"" and met with the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent on Monday.  I just got a phone call from the Superintendent himself and I was told the following: 


* You didn't get the job, but I'm calling because you did very, very well in the process.

* You have incredible potential and your references/qualifications speak to that.


* There's nothing else you could've done; I don't want you to think that you could've done x, y, z or done anything differently. 


* You're at a great point in your career; there was nothing else you could've done. 


* It was a matter of circumstance. 


* We have some openings in the Spring and we really want you to keep us in mind.  We will probably be reaching out to you before you reach out to us. 


I've been in similar positions (i.e. getting to the last round and getting beaten out) probably about a dozen times in the past couple of months and I'm so **very** tired of hearing ""you have incredible potential *BUT* we went with another candidate.""  


I don't know what I'm looking for here, maybe just an outlet to express my exasperation with this process.  But here I am.  I really have done everything I can to prepare myself for each interview; I just (stupidly) let myself get really invested in the idea of this particular position.  Has anyone else felt this way?  What do you think of what he said to me; was it bullsh*t or was it genuine (no one knows for sure, I know..)?  How do I muster the strength to move forward?  I'm so tired of constant rejection and (fake?) validation at the same time.  I can't help but feel defeated each time this happens.  I'm overall a more bitter, jaded person because of this experience.  


I guess it's just two steps forward, one step back.  As cliche as that sounds.  I've got another few interviews lined up and I'm having trouble refocusing on what I need to accomplish because of this blow.  "
Has anyone been a mega-commuter? (90+ min each way),"If so, how was your experience, and how is your commute now?

**My story:**

I've been mega-commuting for three years. Two hours each way, on a small, jerky company shuttle (I experience some degree of motion sickness 95% of the time). I live in a major city, and my job is located 50 miles away.

The reason I do this is because I love living in the city. The people I care about live here (girlfriend, family, friends). I rent my own nice place for a great price. I explore the city a lot. And, I don't need a car and don't own one; I can use public transit or use a Zipcar if I need to get around. I've driven to work in the past, and I just can't endure the gridlock for 75-90 min each way.

I've been doing this 4-hour commute for so long and am somewhat used to it. I work with a wonderful team that I'm in sync with, and the company provides great compensation and benefits.

However...after taking time off recently for the holidays and only having to commute from my bed to the kitchen—Jesus, it finally dawned on me how devastating my commute has been. I finally realize, and feel, the years of cumulative strain on my psychological and physical well-being. I've endured the discomfort, telling myself that I'm just paying my dues; after three years, I'm certain it's time to move on and find a job that'll only take me a 30-min bus ride.

Anyway, would love to hear all of your experiences. Thanks."
My call with a start up CEO-Founder,"So, i work as a back-end web developer in a medium sized company, 500 people or so and some recruitment agency calls me to discuss this new role they have available which seemed really interesting as it will be with a start up company and i will be their main and first developer if i get the job.

I told the agency woman im interested in the job and what she said about it and told her if she can send my CV that will be great. So she sends the CV and tells me they guy would like to do a phone interview. I tell her thats fine and i will take 15 mins break next day to have the call in a local Costa coffee shop near my work place and it gets set up for next day 9.15am.

Next day i go to work, sign in and prepare for the day then i leave to go to Costa and get there for 9.10. i dont get any call until 9.21. So we discuss and go through my CV, he complains about background noises, so i go to the back of the shop and resume the call, he then says thanks and i will report the feedback to the agency bla bla bla.

This is where it get ridiculous, he calls the agency woman and give 2 VERY BAD feedback points according to him. The agency woman says, he said he wasn't happy i was late for the call, and there was train noises in the background which was VERY unprofessional and he is not sure if he can risk the role specially when his company is a start up. ""this is where i interrupted the woman and said, please withdraw my application for this job"".

In regards to the 2 points he mentioned, the noises one thats fine to an extend even though im sure there was not trains inside costa and i hope he didn't expect me to call from my work desk to talk about the role.

Now to say that i was late for the call that just showed my this guy must be really really stupid, or just a troll. How was a i late when you're the one supposed to call me.

I'm just trying to make sense here, and what i can come up with is that he is actually stupid, or he found another developer for a cheaper wage to pay or even more technical abilities than me and decided to come up with those feedbacks instead of just saying no i found someone better.

How I prepared for my first phone interview,"Last week I had my first ever phone interview. Luckily, it was a scheduled interview, so I had a couple of days to get prepared and ask my friends about their experience. 


My former classmate, let's call her Julie, had her first phone interview about a month ago, it went well, she got to the next round which was the office interview, but didn't get the job due to lack of experience. (By the way, don't you just love this ""no job - no experience - no job"" vicious cycle?)


Julie told me she was prepared, read about the company, thought the possible questions through, so she was pretty much relaxed when the phone rang.


Now we know that the call went well, but **Julie made some mistakes**:


1) During the interview she was lying on a couch in her pajamas, that's why her voice was too relaxed and later during the office interview the employer said she didn't sound ""really motivated to get the job"".


2) She didn't turn off the Facebook notifications on her phone so during the talk she was distracted by the message sounds a couple times. Also someone tried to call her on Skype.


3) The other thing Julie regretted was that she didn't have all the needed documents handy. When the employer asked if she had any questions about the company, she remembered she had some, but had put aside her notebook and forgot what it was.


So **Julie helped me realize this**:

1) I better wear something formal and sit straight so that my voice sounds interested and serious, not demotivated.

2) I should eliminate all the distractions

3) My resume, my notes and company info should be somewhere near when I get the call.


Another friend of mine Mike said he got a call from a company when he was walking home. The interviewer asked if he was available to talk at that moment and he said 'yes'. Mike later regretted it because half way through the interview he got nervous and couldn't answer the questions properly. So his advice to me was **never agree to have an unscheduled phone interview**. Apologize, say that you're busy and schedule for later. That way you'll get an opportunity to prepare.


I had a couple other friends give me some tips. I've collected all of it here, in an [article](http://www.essaytigers.com/blog/getting-ready-your-first-phone-interview).


My phone interview went pretty well. I was a little nervous, but prepared. I have an office interview scheduled in a couple days. Wish me luck! And hope my advice helps you!

Is it okay for a company to threaten someone during an interview? True story.,"Is it okay for a company to threaten someone during an interview? True story. Manager at said company (happens to be in Silicon Valley) threatened to so called reveal information about an interviewee. Said strategy badly backfired because interviewee brought in a small army of supporters and kicked manager's ass. Idiotic, idiotic, idiotic. Idiotic what people seem to put up with from managers in companies. Is this the future of work?"
Tata Consulting services (TCS) - Reddit - Do you have any experience working for them?,"Hello =)  
Has anyone worked for this company? TCS (Tata Consultation Services)  I have been offered position with very good pay in the Wilmington, DE area. (three year contract)  I am currently employed but thinking about taking the position.

I am attempting to research what people think about this company?  What experience(s) have you had with them? 

Any information would be greatly appreciated!"
UPDATE: Boss wants me to hide that I quit,"My boss called me (she has been in contact with me at least everyday since I quit, which is new since we'd go weeks without contact whilst working for her) and told me that I am not allowed to mention my job on social media. She said that someone flagged up a post to her in which I said I was unhappy with my job and that things hadn't been going well and I was stressed, which she said was both embarrassing to the company and to myself (even though the company or specifics were never mentioned). She has said she is doing me a favor by asking me to remove this as a future employer would look down on this. 

I will be speaking to her supervisor tomorrow, but she keeps saying my contract came to a ""natural end,"" which is strange to me because I quit. She has emphasized that I don't say anything bad about her or the job once it is done, however, once my notice period is up, I am confused over what she can even do....and at this point since I'm within my notice period, I am still confused as to what she can do to me for vaguely mentioning my unhappiness on social media. 

Can't wait to be rid of this job.

"Interviewing tomorrow with Uniqlo, has anyone ever worked for them?","I am loosing my job in two weeks due to my workplace going out of business so I have to find a job quick. I saw the local Uniqlo store is hiring so I applied and have a ""first round"" interview with them tomorrow. I have worked retail before and have had a few jobs so I was wondering if anyone here has worked for them and if it's any better than the average retail job? This isnt my first interview by any means but I like to be prepared so what can I expect in the interview? Also what is the dress code like? Do I have to wear only Uniqlo brands or something (totally fine with that). 

Any and all advice is appreciated thanks!"
"My rent is $45 a month, which includes heat, electricity and about 50 cars. Let me explain...","About two months ago I hit rock bottom. My job and its shitty salary couldn't sustain me anymore. I was about to get kicked out. Then I had an idea. I live in an apartment or I used to anyway, and they have a huge garage. Parking spots cost $45 a month. I spoke to management and they told me that it won't happen. So I went to another apartment and asked them. I said I'll pay you the $45 a month for a spot but instead of a car I'm going to set up a little section for myself. Well, holy shit he said yes. I put up a makeshift wall so that no one will be disturbed by my presence, I'm only there at night really so the people aren't active while I'm there and I still have my shit job but now who gives a damn, my rent is $45. 

Remember folks, we live in a democratic society, lol not really it's an oligarchy but the important thing to remember is, society doesn't have to dictate how you find your happiness. I don't work hard at my job, at all. Hard work doesn't pay off if you don't mind living in a garage. 

Peace out!"
Best Job Boards to Find Niche Talent,"Everyone knows the job boards like Craigslist, Indeed, and Monster, but there are over 100 different other job boards that specialize in various niche industries.

As someone applying to jobs, this can be great because you can find a much more targeted list of opportunities based on your career desires.

Also, as a business owner, they can be a great resource to find a targeted interested pool of candidates for a low cost.

A few examples I've come across:

* Creative: [TalentZoo](http://www.talentzoo.com/), [Art Jobs](http://artjobs.artsearch.us/)
* Media: [MediaBistro](http://www.mediabistro.com/)
* Startups: [Angelist](https://angel.co/)
* Nonprofit: [Idealist.org](http://www.idealist.org/)
* Technology: [Dice](http://www.dice.com/), [Stack Overflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/)
* Legal: [LawJobs](http://lawjobs.com/)
* Restaurant/Hospitality: [Culintro](http://culintro.com/), [PoachedJob](http://poachedjobs.com/choose)

* Healthcare: [CareerVitals](http://www.careervitals.com/)
* Constructions: [RigZone](http://www.rigzone.com/)
* Retail: [WorkInRetail](http://www.workinretail.com/)

Sometimes it takes looking beyond the first page of Google search results to find these boards, but they are a great resource for job seekers and people hiring.

As an employer, you can also use sites like [Proven](http://www.proven.com) and [ZipRecruiter](http://www.ziprecruiter.com) to post automatically to a lot of these niche jobs as well as the big dogs like Craigslist and Indeed.

Anyone else have a good experience with a niche job board? Some of the intern ones have worked great for me in the past."
