Are you seriously trying to quit your job during a global pandemic and impending recession? o_O,"This will probably be downvoted to hell. That’s okay. 

But really, there has been an uptick in people posting about quitting their jobs. This isn’t to berate you. If you aren’t happy, you really should find a way to leave. Your mental health and professional fulfilment is much MUCH more important in the long run. 

HOWEVER, if you know that you don’t have a fat kitty saved up or a wealthy family to fall back on- please don’t make the jump just yet! The same goes for those in jobs with an easier ‘replacement index’ or ‘entry bar’ (cringe). Don’t do it!

Think long and hard. Where I am, the depression from the lockdown retrenchments alone has led to a rise in suicides. Quitting your job and then finding yourself in the cold may put you in a worse off position.

This is sounding harsh but it is coming from a good place. Things are going to work out. We just don’t know when. In the meantime, hang in there. Take this global lockdown time to plan your exit meticulously, save up and start skilling up for the jump. 

Good luck!"
"Anyone else graduated, got in a 'career' and realise there was more to life than work?","It's probably the number 1 thing driving me into depression. I can't come to terms with the fact that as I'm coming to 30, never have I felt more certain that the idea of a 'career' or working for the rest of my life in some repetitive job just to support my housing, family and retirement, is just NO life.

I'm not sure if it's bad experiences, or not knowing what exactly it is I want to do. Heck, I'm being paid 55k, but have already decided I will resign before the end of the year, leave London, and move back to my hometown (where opportunities are limited). This is simply because, after several years of slaving it out in an office, I so desperately miss feeling PURPOSE in life. Whether that's living under mum's roof and feeling the love of living with my family, being at University, and being surrounded by some of the best friends and richest experiences, being young and adventurous, traveling. Living life. 

Ever since I graduated and got into the 'workforce', aka, sitting at my corporate desk all day every day, life has been a misery. Eeach and every day typically morphs into the same scenario, wake up early, feel tired, commute, spend x hours under intense stress, commute home, change, cook, wash dishes, maybe go gym, bed, repeat. Then the weekend. Even weekends are duller than they used to be because people are so busy or spend time with their other halves or whatever else.

I came to realise through a lot of self-reflection during lockdown, that it's not the job, or the industry (I changed industry to mix it up and try something new). I realised that selling all of my time just to receive a paycheck, is nonsense. To the point where I'd rather resign and be unemployed whilst preparing for long-term travelling. It's strange because I want someone to tell me I'm barking mad, to leave a nice paid 55k job in the city for what I want - but you can't help what you feel. I'd imagine it's like a gay person and bottling up their feelings and then eventually coming out. For me, the truest thing I feel in my heart is that I just don't want to work 9-5 for the rest of my life, full stop. I want more out of life than living for the weekend, than defining my life and value by my 'work'. I can't derive value from anything else because I spend 80% of my waking time at work/commuting. No job has ever brought me any sense of purpose in life. It just draws me down further, gradually.

I just think it's an incredble shame, that we spend our lives in the pursuit of careers, selling our health, our time, our relationships and everything else just to put money in the bank and jump on the old societal bandwagon of buying a house and settling down. I thought after going into uni and then into the exciting world of financial services, that I had life set. But suddenly, I could not want it less. Even the idea of spending 30 years paying off a mortgage disinterests me. I find it a grim and miserable idea. What's wrong with me? But scarily, there's no viable alternative. It seems though a lot of people around my age who think similarly travel, so that's what I'm considering also.

Any others feel the same way?"
"""wE'vE dEcIdEd NoT tO mOvE fOrWaRd At ThIs TiMe."" Is anyone else sick of reading these emails?","I'm so sick of these emails. I want to scream bloody murder everytime I open one up. I wish they would just be honest and tell me that I'm absolute trash and that's why I was rejected instead of beating around the bush. I don't know why I'm even bothering. I'm stuck in my dead end job forever and that'll be my life.

What are your guys' thoughts?"
"I hate office culture, I hate my job, am burnt out and my mental health is suffering. After COVID dies down, I just want to work on building a life where I'll be happy. How can I make a realistic plan?","Firstly, I'll just preface this post by saying that I KNOW I'm lucky to have kept my job during COVID. I'm aware that many people have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and been forced into difficult situations (and my heart goes out to them). However, I hope it can be taken into account that many of us are struggling in many different ways right now.

Without getting into too much detail, I've been extremely unhappy with my job for some time now and was planning on leaving until COVID happened. I'm a copywriter at a marketing company. I honestly hate sales and marketing writing. I also now feel stuck and like I can't plan a proper exit strategy. I'm currently experiencing total employee burnout and my performance is really starting to slip. I haven't slept at all in the past night and this happens regularly. I'm also not eating properly and am just dealing with anxiety, depression and fatigue. I can hardly think or focus on anything.

However, my general feelings about this really aren't a result of what's happened with COVID. I've honestly been feeling this way for quite a long time now. My company's current work from home setup has not improved any of this, but even pre-COVID my company was very poorly managed, with a lot of inexperienced people running the show and an extreme lack of organization. There's a lot of trite, stupid stuff the company forces everyone to do to try to ""make sure we work as a team"". There are constant, excessive amounts of hour-long, sometimes two hour-long meetings (with an increased frequency during our current WFH setup), where nobody contributes anything valuable to a conversation and where I get the sense that they're only arranged so that managers feel relevant. There's a whooole lot of office politics and people getting their own way by kissing up to the right people. It's all so repulsive, fake and so many of these processes just take away from my productivity.

As someone who is by nature quite introverted and who greatly dislikes having to navigate through annoying people problems, constantly having to tread around the politics, put on a face and play a game every week has become so mentally draining. And that's not even on top of all the work I have. It's a regular occurrence that I work MANY extra hours on top of my regular ones, all of which I'm not paid for. Before we started WFH, I'd regularly stay at the office until 8, sometimes 9pm trying to get work done. Now, I just keep working and don't turn my computer off until late hours in the day.

I've had several people tell me I should find a better job and that my current company isn't run well, but I honestly fear that every office job is like this. That every office job will involve having to say things that you wouldn't normally say to people for 8 hours a day, having to participate in pretentious, vapid and unproductive meetings for the sake of making the more ego-driven staff feel important, having to listen to coworkers talk more about other people than the work itself, being constantly distracted, having to tread on eggshells, etc. I know many have probably said something of the like before me, but it just seems like there should be so much more to life than this. I see other people at my company who seem so excited about the culture, who seem so personable and like they fit into it so well, and I can't help but wonder... is it just me who sees through all of this, or are they just better actors than I am?

I'm a writer and an artist and as much as I am preparing to hear answers such as ""this is life"", ""most people have to deal with this to get by financially"" and ""you won't make any money and will struggle taking an alternative route"", I really can't fathom the idea of spending another 10 years of my life dealing with office culture and putting my time and energy into a climate I despise so much. I really want to value myself, my talents and my life more than this. I really don't want to live anymore if this is all there is to life.

Does anyone have a story they can share about how they transitioned out of this lifestyle and took on a job that allowed them more time to work on their creative pursuits? Such as working at a coffee shop, restaurant or something where you can clock in/clock out a little more easily? I know taking a pay cut is inevitable, but I want to explore the possibility of actually living a lifestyle that will make me happier. Feedback is welcome, and I apologize if this is lengthy and if any of this doesn't sound realistic."

"Has COVID made you reconsider, not just a job change, but an entire career shift moving forward?","I've been meeting people left and right who have outright considered COVID to be somewhat of a blessing in disguise in terms of their career shifts. This time in lockdown has allowed many people the time to sit and meditate on many things that have been swept under the rug for years.

Despite many of us being stuck in a pickle right now after having faced layoffs and furloughs, I've also run across many of the same people who are otherwise relieved to have finally been ""freed"" from their jobs.  It feels like the universe is playing a round of musical chairs with many of us right now.

So has COVID made you reconsider, not just a job change, but an **entire** career shift moving forward?"
Did Covid-19 put a halt on your job search ? Join the club.,"Right before the mass hysteria happened, I had just completed a preliminary video interview for this media/entertainment company.  I was calm, cool and collected. Took my time and practiced so I was confident throughout the process. They said I would hear the results back in 1-3 weeks. However, I did not expect a global pandemic to be going on at the same time as well lol. I still feel very confident and optimistic about it. It just sucks that this pandemic happened at the WRONG time. I want to reach out to the recruiter who contacted me but I don’t even know if there office is closed or not. The job is located in NYC and I feel like it could be another month before I hear back about the results. Has the Covid-19 interrupted anyone else on their job search ? We are in this together."
Anyone else get annoyed with Linkden? (Rant),"It's a great resource for finding jobs and networking, but it seems so fake to me. 

Example: someone posts something like - Today, my salary was reduced by half my pay, and based on where we are with COVID, I was not upset. I pushed my team, blah, blah, blah. Such BULLSHIT, right?! No one is okay with making less. 

Example2: someone worked 6 months at a role which they had no experience in prior - generated this, consulted that, and managed 200,000 whatever, whatever, fake! 

It just seems like such a fake place to try and make yourself look good. It's adult show and tell about their careers, which is fine, but so many 'fakish' profiles and douchebags. 

In a way, it's maybe upsetting because I'm more humble and will post simple - 4 years at x company working in x area managing x, y & z. 

Thoughts? Maybe I'm the douchebag."
"Interviewer berated me because of a misspelled word on my resume, they were incorrect. How should I have handled this situation?","The allegedly misspelled word was 'Licence'. In America, and possible other countries that use American English, the word is spelled 'License'; in Canada and the UK, it is not. 

On my resume I have a section near the end that lists a few licences and certifications I have. The interview was for a very large engineering company that gave me the interview after a recommendation I received, so I assume they only glanced at the resume before giving me a call.

The interview itself was supposed to be an hour, but it only lasted around 45 minutes. I was being interviewed by a man, Joe, and a woman, Jane. Near the beginning of the interview Joe points something out on my resume to Jane and smirks, I knew the area of my resume he was looking at and assumed it was to do with a cert I have that doesn't formally expire so the formatting is weird.

The interview went really well, but it all fell apart at the end when we were wrapping up, Joe said ""just one last question, how do you not proofread a resume?"". He followed it up with a comment about how it otherwise looked great and I obviously put time into it, but this typo was jarring. I asked what typo and he just pointed at 'Licence'; my reaction was shock and a stunned silence before I said ""that's how you spell that"". Which he didn't like. He chuckled at my comment and sounded really annoyed when he just spat out that no, it wasn't. I didn't know what to say so I doubled down and he got very annoyed / angry and became pretty condescending. He started lecturing me about how he was trying to help me, how I obviously wouldn't be getting this job but in the future I should just focus on my spelling and not to attack interviewers. We started to argue and bicker over it and it was getting heated when he told me to leave. I said check your drivers licence and tell me how it's spelled there but he wouldn't. He just ended the interview on that note. While I packed my things and put my coat on, Jane checked, and told Joe that it's spelled licence there. I had already mentioned that 'License' is the american english way, but he didn't seem to know what i meant.

How should I handle that in the future, or should i just take the word of my resume?"

Is there no place for employees that are just “pretty good” at their jobs?,"Is there no room for employees that are “pretty good” at their jobs?

For context, I work in advertising in New York. 

I’ve been in this industry about three years and I’ve basically learned there’s no place for people who want to show up every day and do their job because work is a necessity and you have to do what you have to do in life but without letting it consume you. Everywhere I’ve worked my employer seems to feel like it’s reasonable to expect the entire workforce to be hyper-career oriented, workaholic, type A people who don’t value anything in life higher than their job.

It’s not enough to do your job because it’s your job, you have to keep a facade of passion and believing in the company’s mission and shit and this is 100% expected to be your entire life. Imperfection equates to total failure and being a “pretty good” employee gets you fired. 

Is it even possible to find a job where you’re not surrounded by miserable work-addicted people who expect you to be the same? I’ve been thinking about a career change but I’m afraid it’ll be the same no matter where I am."

I wanted to find some job shadow opportunities in my area to help me try other things and guide me towards a decision to get out of my current career or not. However, all the programs and opportunities I found in my area have been cancelled or suspended due to the Coronavirus crisis, making me stuck in place for now. This is frustrating to say the least, and I want to know if the stupid Coronavirus has crapped all over anyone else’s career plans."
Anyone study their ass off in university just to end up in a job you don’t like?,"As a teenager I was always good in math/science. I didn’t have any specific interests.

So I got into engineering, out of all the different fields of engineering I thought civil engineering was the best fit for me. Grinded my ass off, though interesting, without a doubt worst 5 years of my life (while college/uni is supposed to be the best…) Anyway, I’m gonna have a good job with decent pay so it’s all worth it right? Wrong. Working as a project manager, salary aint great but also not bad. But now I see I have no passion for what I am doing, it's just a job and I am glad I can go home. Now I realize I might not have made the best choices in my life. And it’s not just my job, I come into contact with all kinds of people/jobs in construction. Anyone else in this situation?

Moral of the story: I know its cliché, but try to find something you are passionate about, only that will fulfill you. I hope I will be able to find this for myself."

For example, discussions I've had with ones on one's with each of them are all fine and dandy, and respectful, but they discuss my reply, or lack thereof, and assess. I also discovered the human resources point of contact is also in the bouts. I also discovered they have taken screenshots of my social media and posted it to their conversations to throw even more salt into the fire. 

This has absolutely broken my heart. And I'm not sure what to do. My mental health has not been good."

How do I tolerate a 9-5?,"I just started my first job out of university a few weeks ago. I work in finance. I’ve always wanted to be in finance and had no doubt it was the right career path for me. I’ve been working for a little over a week now and I’ve never been more miserable. My boss and coworkers are very nice, the work I’m doing is challenging and engaging, the hours are manageable but i still feel empty. I never knew the 9-5 would be this soul sucking. Every morning when I sit in my chair I picture myself doing it every day for the next 40 years of my life and almost tear up. Staring at a spreadsheet and drowning in fluorescent lights is a waste of a life. Obviously there’s no conventional way out of this 9-5 life, but i just don’t understand how people make peace with it.The job is good so i know if I quit, I’ll just face the same problem somewhere else. How do I live a meaningful life while doing meaningless work?"
How do I get over my deep-seated dislike of working?,"I’m in my early 20’s. I’ve just gotten a new job that I really want to do well at, but this disdain for work is deeply affecting my work and my enthusiasm for the role. I’ve worked part-time jobs and they weren’t so bad, but something about every 9-5 office job just feels like signing up for your own death. Like this desk, or another one, will be where I sit till I die. 

I resent it so much. I resent that our society is built this way, I resent that I have to spend my days doing this when I don’t enjoy it, I resent that lucky people like Kylie Jenner can sit at their gorgeous pools in the sun and play on their phones all day. 

I know I sound childish. I know this is just how it is. I’ve literally paid for school with the intent of having an office job. What do I do? How do I stop thinking this way and just accept that this is life? How do I start feeling enthusiasm and excitement for this role, especially now that I’ve just started at a new office? (I’m working remotely for now, but still). 

I would sincerely appreciate any advice. I’m scared this feeling could ruin my life. It’s been consistent with every office job I’ve ever worked. 

If this is the wrong subreddit, I’ll move the post. But I’ve always liked the advice given here. Thank you."
"It’s no longer enough to do your job, but you have to be above and beyond to keep it?","I’m not sure if this is mostly a startup thing, but I just find those roles are generally more open. I had an interview with a non startup recently who also adopts this mentality so I’m scared to even proceed in the process.

The past few jobs I’ve had, I would start and do pretty well, but then my responsibilities would grow and I can’t handle it. I’ve been let go twice for not being “up to par” with what they want. It kills me they rather have no one in the spot than me doing an average job. Average is no longer enough. You can’t just do your job, you have to constantly wow everyone. 

Is this normal for most companies these days? How can I find a company I can feel safe at? I’m doing my best. Everyone knows I’m not lazy."
Do you feel like COVID-19 is going to change the workforce permanently?,"I feel like COVID could change the workforce for the better.

Instead of having to be glued to an office chair 5 days a week, I really feel like office jobs will convert to a WFH type of environment. On the off chance that you still do need to go to an office, I feel like the days you are required to be on-site will be reduced.

I also feel like the e-commerce business will be the way to go as people aren't going to want to really deal in hand to hand exchanges. Just my opinion.

Is it worth leaving a job for the sake of your mental health?,"TL;DR: The behavior of my toxic boss has taken a toll on my mental health to the point where I now take medication and seek therapy to get through working with her. I have a part-time job on the side that doesn't make much or has any benefits. Is it worth leaving this job for the sake of my mental health and stick out working part-time until something better arrives? 

I've been working for an organization for the past year under an extremely toxic boss. At first, I accepted her micromanaging because I was working in a field that I had no experience in and wanted to make sure that I was doing my job correctly. After a few months at the organization, I was asked to take on additional responsibilities because a co-worker left and that only exacerbated my working relationship with my boss. She constantly lied to me saying that the other manager I was assisting thought I was doing a horrible job and didn't understand why I was doing what I was doing. She demeaned my work performance (whilst managing two brand new roles), telling me I was unqualified to do even the basic functions of my job. I try to work as independently as possible, but because of her micromanagement style, she doesn't hesitate to complain to directors that she constantly has to manage my work. I've tried going back to the directors about this, and they are unwilling to hear my side of things. 

But as a result of the constant undermining, I've started to notice a decline in my performance. I'm constantly on-edge with everything I do and say. Not only does she negatively critique my work and performance, but she also doesn't hesitate to criticize the way I write my emails to vendors and other associates too. It's gotten to the point where I'm petrified responding back to any email I receive. Currently, I'm going to a therapist to help me cope with her behavior and started taking anti-anxiety medication.

I spoke with the person that had the position before me and they ended up leaving the role after five months due to the stress and anxiety our boss caused. 

I've worked in other high-pressure roles in the past but nothing compares to working with her. 

Luckily, I'm in a good position financially if I need to quit. I also have a part-time job that I've had for 15 years that's not a part of my career path, but can offer a temporary income (albeit not much).  Would it be worth leaving this role to work on my mental health and wait for something better to come around?"
does anyone regret the college degree that they got?,"Maybe a degree that they found to be useless or hasn’t helped them get a job? If so, what do you do for work now?

I was rejected from a position that required a high school diploma when I have a bachelor's. How am I supposed to properly handle how pathetic I feel right now?,"There was a lab job I applied for that only required a high school diploma and practically no experience was required. Being that I have a bachelor's degree and some lab experience, I figured I might have a shot. Turns out my application was about as worthless as a used candy wrapper.

I was sent a rejection email within a few days saying how I wasn't a ""good fit"" and how they decided to move on with another candidate (probably the hiring manager's friend/family member). I feel like absolute garbage right now. Even jobs with the most basic requirements don't want anything to do with me. I keep getting told to stay positive and keep tricking through, but how am I supposed to keep going when I have all of these rejections and failures punching me in the stomach and kicking me while I'm down.

I hate job hunting so much. The whole process is stupid and I wish it wouldn't be so stressful. I feel incredibly pathetic and I don't know what to do about it."
My company keeps forcing everyone to do social activities on webcam as a means of overcompensating for the fact that we're working from home. I'm really not a fan of this. What should I do?,"I'm really not a fan of forced socialization (especially when it's organized ""team activities""), mainly because the type of work I do at my company (and in general) is very solitary and when I have a lot on my plate, I have always seen zero benefit in having to step away from my work and socialize in a way that doesn't feel natural for me.

Right now, my company is obviously working at home because of COVID. When I found out that we'd be working from home for an extended period of time, I was honestly really happy. As someone whose job requires a lot of focus and solitude, I really thrive when I'm just by myself and can zone in on my work without distractions. However, management keeps speaking to our company like they are worried about us all being shut-in and not being in the office. We're now forced to have some meetings every day (over Zoom), that we otherwise have once or twice a week in the office (for a couple of them, it's starting to seem like people don't know what to talk about). In addition to this, management keeps planning all of these ""social"" activities over Zoom that they aren't making voluntary.

I'm the only person who has my role at my company and we've taken a hard hit because of COVID. As such, I've actually had a huge increase in my workload since this has happened, which I've tried desperately to stay on top of. I won't lie - this situation has caused me to feel extremely burnt out and stressed as I'm trying my best to cope with everything. I feel like my main duty is to do my job and stay on top of it, and having to keep breaking my focus is making this so much tougher. I just want to be at home and focus on my work so I can get through this, and all of this forced social crap is infuriating.

I don't want to say something that will get me into any trouble, but I also don't understand why they are ""forcing"" these activities and not sort of advertising them for people to do if they wish/if they have spare time. Especially during a time where everyone is being put under stress and not everyone will be dealing with it in the same way. What should I do? Should I say anything to my manager or just stay quiet?"
"What are some niche careers that while not that widely known, you think people should be aware of?",Pretty straight forward. I have heard a few people tell me that the career they are working in now isn't one they had ever even considered when they were younger. Got me to thinking that there are probably loads of career opportunities that people don't even know are out there.
What is it about the 9-5 corporate life that seems to suck my soul away despite having worked much harder in university?,"When I was in college, I remember studying all the time, morning and night. Weekends were definitely spent studying and catching up on work. Schoolwork was a 24/7 kind of thing, and it was certainly exacerbated by my school’s quarter system. I probably put in at minimum 2X more work than what I’m doing now in my corporate job. 

Now contrast this to worklife now, and it’s fairly light in comparison.  There’s usually a cutoff time for work, meaning I can just shut off after like 6pmish. I don’t work weekends and the pay is alright. Some days I only have to put in around 4 hours of “real work” in the office. My job is not repetitive either. I work in software product management, not like data entry, accounting, or something like that. 

And yet, I’m feeling much more depressed and drained mentally for some reason. I’ve never had this feeling in my life before, and I’m actually not sure why because objectively speaking, the “work” is less than what I did in college. 

Basically, it feels like a dementor is sucking out all my energy and mood every day. When I get home I have to take a nap and my mind just shuts off.  At first, it wasn’t too bad, but then this never ending cycle started accumulating.  The days started to blend, then the weeks, now I feel like I’m counting in months. I don’t even get excited on holidays anymore because it’s a reminder of how little control over my time I have. 

I’m wondering if this is just a personal problem or there’s something I’m not catching. 

Why is it that I’m able to float around some corporate job and do 50% less work than what I did as student, get paid for it, and still feel like shit?

Is it part of the process of life? Is it the constant routine? The work actual job or company itself? Maybe because there is no more autonomy? Or perhaps my memory is selectively choosing to remember only the positive aspects of college? Or maybe I’m just mentally weak?

Sorry if this post makes me sound like a wuss. I’m just venting and trying to figure out the cause because I don’t want to sound like a little pos in front of my friends and family"
"Hello Millenials. I'm graduating university next year into the recession/depression, and I'm terrified. How did you survive the 2009 recession and its aftermath?","Hi! For the majority of my high school life/university career I've been working towards a creative communications career- pr, brand management, advertising. I've always been optimistic that I'd be able to either find or create opportunities for myself to make a good career path. I work part time for the canadian government, and I do some admin work for a small management company on the side. My plan had been to immediately move and find a job in my desired field, however I don't know how long the recession/depression is going to last after this and I don't want to be broke. So i guess my question is how did you survive the recession and is it possible to work jobs that are within your ideal career path but aren't as stable? How did you create a career path after the recession to a job that you do enjoy?"
How is it true that full-time office job is the ultimate goal of all these years of studying?,"I'm sorry if this post may come off as depressing, but it seems that I have been living in my shell for so long, that I stopped understanding some basic stuff.

The thing is, I just landed my first full-time job at quite good IT company.

During my years of studying I never worked or even had an internship due to personal related health issues.

However, now, here I am, and I am in some state of shock.

How can it be that after all these struggles and years of studying - this office full-time job IS the ultimate goal that about which we should dream and fight to reach?

How can anyone willingly sell 5/7 of their lifetime away... just, I don't know, sitting at desk, sharing stories with colleagues near cooler and all this stuff?

I'm also experiencing some anxiety-related physical issues right now, so that may be clouding my jugment.

It's not that I don't want to work. I realize that is absolutely neccessary part of life. I always loved studying, doing stuff... It's quite okay to me to spend most time of the day just working hard.

However, this inflexibilty, having to sit at my desk from 9 to 6 even if there is nothing noteworthy to do... It just drives me crazy.  


So, can anyone share, why having a full-time office job is.. good?"
"Employer is paying new hires more than me with 8 years of experience and around 5 promotions above that original position, how do I handle it?","Hello, first let me start with the fact that I currently love my job. 

I started out as a seasonal technician in 2012 at $10 an hour. I now work at $18 an hour doing full time sales / website development/ Graphic design/ and general IT. This is a huge step up over where I started and is equivalent of 4-5 promotions over the years. 

But my issue is a new hire was going on and on about how great his pay was and telling other employees. The new hire is getting payed $18.50 and hour to be a seasonal technician, which is the same position I started at. As far as I can tell he has no experience in the field and used to work in accounting. 

My question is, is this fair? I know with pay compression, new employees start to make more and more money each year. But should it outpace someone who has been at the  company for as long as I have. And to top it all off, Our company announced that because of COIVD they are not doing and raises this year."
"Is there more to life than a 9-5, 40-hour work week?","Day in and day out, go to work and go home. It seems there's no excitement anymore.

Five days out of seven are spent working, and in the weekends - all I want to do is stay in and do nothing, speak to no one. But I can't quit my job since I need to pay the bills and live my life, of which I have none. Is there truly more to life than a 9-5 and 40-hour workweek?"
"I am a 29 year old male who has autism, never had a job and gets rejected for everyone I apply to and is looking at being homeless so could you please help me?","Up until this week I had lived at the same house my entire life and I had to leave because my grandma sold it. She is letting me sleep on her floor until September 1st when she moves to a new city. I can't get an apartment because i have no proof of employment and I have no savings. My grandma bought me a storage unit but its $108 a month and I can't pay for August. 

We tried getting me on disability but the lawyer wouldn't take my case because they said its hard to win because I am high functioning and did well in college despite the math issues. I couldnt find a job from the ages of 18-23 so I spent the last 6 years taking out loans for an English degree because I wanted to write fiction novels for a living. I now owe 45k in debt and I cant pass that degree because it requires me to pass a math class and I have failed 7 or 8 math classes. 

I have ptsd from a sexual assault at a psych facility so I am really jumpy and squeamish when I am physically touched. And I have a lot of wierd things about me. I really suck at talking with people and communication but I try. I just cant look at people in the eyes and I stumble over words.  I don't have any job skills outside of being a part time handyman assistant and moving karaoke equipment. I have only one good reference.

Im terrified right now. Im absolutely devastated over the loss of my home and its brought back all these memories of my dead relatives. I am getting treatment at a mental health clinic and they did get me in the system for affordable housing but even if I get it it wont be until 2-3 months down the line at best and I would have to pay money for it which I dont have. 

I need help please help me. Im scared of being on the street and losing all my stuff and being homeless forever and never getting to live my dreams.

Hey everyone I couldn't possibly respond to all of your offers from help. I am starting my new job this week and I am thrilled. Im going to start looking for an apartment today. Thank you so much for the help."
"Is adult life after college just sort of, guesswork and taking it one day at a time?","I graduated college at 22, I'm 25 now, and not in my field, but working towards it. A lot of my day-to-day life is figuring things out and wondering where I'm heading and going. Most of the time, I do not know what I am doing, I am just guessing, what to eat for dinner, where to go on my day off, what jobs to apply for, everything in life is sort of guessing for me. I don't mind it, but there's no one to essentially hold your hand, and I'm wondering if other people felt the same about all this. Guessing where to go, guessing what job to take. 

&#x200B;

In high school and college, everything is given to you. Your schedule, your friends, essentially, your life. With being a free man, you have so much time at your disposal and it's kind of bizarre not to try to make anything of it. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; is life after college just a guessing game, and what do you do?"
"Considering quitting my job, which I interact with the same 15 people daily, to protect my elderly relative I live with. I have money saved for est. 7 years of living expenses. Would you choose the job or make sure your relative is as safe as possible and quit?","I go back and forth on this. I'm in one of those thankless jobs you fall into but stick it out for the paycheck. I'm 8 months when the pandemic hit. 15 people were considered essential, including myself. Reading the unemployment rate, I certainly having a new appreciation for just having a job and am humbled by that. It's a large building, though, and several companies are still open. So the real number I encounter, and the risk, is higher. 

On the flip side, I do have money saved and the IRS is giving me money from a mistake they uncovered so my new budget would put me at 7 years of living expenses covered. 

The concern is my mother. After the passing of my dad, I moved in with my mom to help her with little things. It's worked out surprisingly well, she's a sweetheart. 

Now I feel incredible guilt just leaving and coming home daily, putting her at risk. Her health, thankfully, is pretty good. She's a lovely person and I couldn't live with myself knowing I harmed her.

I drive under freeway signs that say to stay home.  I'm so tormented on what is the right thing to do. People scrambling to get jobs, I have a crappy one but, who cares, it's money coming in. If my mom didn't now rely on me so much, I would just move out but she does require a bit of daily care.

What do you think is the smartest move if you were faced with this? Oh, and thank you and wishing you well."
"I dropped the ""F"" word in a meeting a few months ago.. I apologized already but my coworker is still being passive aggressive about it towards me... How can I fix this?","I held a 15 minute design presentation to two Product owners a few months ago, it was to explain how a new design will affect the way that their teams will be working. During the presentation I kept on getting interrupted - as I only had 15 mins of their time, i felt frustrated and might have unconsciously been thinking negatively so i accidentally added an ""f"" word in one of my example scenarios while I was explaining. I have since apologised especially when one of the PO brought it up during one of our lunch gatherings - I understood that its unprofessional.

It had been months since the incident happened but the same PO who was in the meeting is still acting very passive aggressive towards me. For example, today she attempted to embarrass me in front of everyone during our remote meetings by asking if I'm working inside a toilet.. after that, we had a group picture on ZOOM and someone decided to use Donald Trump as their profile picture, since I was the one who took a screenshot of the group picture she accused me of adding in Donald Trump after sharing it to the group.. and she broadcasted it to everyone in our group chat.

To my defence, I am not the only one who curses in the meetings but it seems that she's just targeting me, what should I do? and please don't lecture me how wrong it was to curse, I've beaten myself too much about it already.  


EDIT: Hi guys, I was not expecting the pouring of support from everyone. I thought that I'll get the opposite response that's why I was defensive in the last paragraph. The situation is hard, but it's giving me some peace of mind to know that maybe she's acting that way because she has an issue too. I've been trying to watch some youtube videos on how to be quick on your feet to respond when someone is trying to attack your character. If you guys know any good videos I'd appreciate it if you can please share them in the comments below -- and maybe a tutorial also on how not to care too much if this happens again, it's really draining mentally and emotionally!"
"Serious question, why do many entry level jobs require 2-3 years of experience?","Recent finance grad 21 yo auditor here. I got lucky with no experience, never had a job before, and I landed an auditor job in F500 which was requiring 1+ years of experience. 9 months experience later and I got laid off recently due to COVID-19.

I started applying for jobs again, (staff accountant jobs), and so many recruiters are calling me back for interview but on the job posting it says **2+ years accounting experience required.**

I am very strong in my accounting knowledge and my accounting experience. **So my question is, why are employers asking a minimum of 2-3 YEARS EXPERIENCE REQUIRED, when I keep getting interviews with only 9 months but they require 2-3 YEARS EXPERIENCE?**"
Why do employers and candidates play these little charades during the interview/hiring process?,"I am a recent graduate looking for a job and it bothers me to no end that employers seem to come up with the most ridiculous things to do/ questions to answer for applicants during the hiring process. Tests that can be faked or you later find out don't attribute to the hiring decision. Questions you can just lie about to get in their good graces. Questions employers know everyone is going to answer the same anyway even if it is not true. 

""Now Mr.Smith, this is a prestigous position (it is not but whatever), so we are only looking for people who are hard workers. Are you a hard worker?"" -\_- .....

I mean, seriously what they hell is this? Why do employers do this? Can somebody please explain this?

Is it normal to just not know what you want to do?,"Is it normal to just not know what you want to do? 

&#x200B;

So much of my career is based on impulse. I have a general sense of where I want to go, but lots of anxiety about where I don't. Most people seem to be set in their career, they want to be an actor, doctor, lawyer, here I am - a rift raft in the water, not sure what to do, where to go, and unsure of myself.

I stay because I don’t hate it, and the conditions are excellent which I know I shouldn’t take for granted. I’m just wondering if my constant daydreaming about something else is a sign I should *do* something else, or is it a normal part of a 20 plus year career. Thanks for any perspective you might feel happy to share!"
How do you stop constant job rejections effecting your mental health?,"I got a great Master’s degree from a great university, I’ve done volunteering, co-ran a record label for over 2 years, my career advice group from my university say my cv and cover letters look great but I still keep getting constantly rejected. I had an interview that I felt went great a couple weeks ago but got rejected and no feedback as to why. This is the rejection that has really cut me up.

I KNOW I have the ability to be a great employee and have lots of great attributes but no employer can see this and it’s starting to cause havoc on my mental health. I’ve done all the hard work through university and beyond and it all feels worthless. I feel worthless. How do I get out of this mental black hole? How do you stop the constant rejection impacting your mental health?"
How the heck do people decide what it is they want to do for the rest of their lives?,"It's such a strange concept to me. When we're dumb hormonal teenagers at 18 we're forced to make a decision that will affect the rest of our lives. I stupidly went to school for history because I really had no clue what I wanted to do. To make matters even worse, I went right into a masters degree in it afterwards, as a means of delaying 'real life' for two more years (though I didn't admit that to myself at the time). Now here I am, out of university without a clue what it is I want to do. I'm not really qualified for much, anyways. I tried admin 9-5 type work briefly but was extremely miserable. 

How do people make this huge decision? I'd be willing to go back to school to get some actual applicable skills, but I just have absolutely zero clue what would be appealing to me.

EDIT: For everyone telling me to just try a bunch of new positions, I've been trying to do this, and have sent out over 500 applications to a wide range of industries, with zero callbacks. Employers here aren't willing to take a risk with an untrained new hire, and most entry level positions require at least 3 years of experience."

How do I tell the family I've been babysitting for that I need to be getting paid more then $25 a day?,"Originally posted somewhere else but it got taken down and said I should post here. So please help me out. 

I babysit for this family. They have a 3 year old who I love to death. I've known the mom ever since I was little because my parents are friends with hers. The mom is 23 now. She WAS a single parent when she first needed me to babysit back in September. And now she is married. They are both cops that work in the jails. 

When she first needed me she was a single mom and I told her to pay me as much as she could and she told me she could only do $25 a day (she only needs me Saturday and sunday). So I was okay with it because that's all she could afford. I originally would start at 12:45 PM and go till 9:30 -10 pm and then she started to need me earlier. From 12:45, 12:30, 12:00, 11:30 am, 11am, and sometimes to 10am.

She ended up getting more serious with her boyfriend and he moved in so I ended up getting off around 7 PM. Now they're married so they have two incomes coming in. Their schedules got changed so now they both work from 5:30 am to 2pm, so they need me to come over at 4:45am till 3 PM. 

I did the math for how much im getting paid by the hour and it's around $2.72. I live with my boyfriend now, and with the whole coronavirus this is my only source of income since the other family I baby sat for doesn't need me any more.  I'm not sure if I should tell her I need to be getting paid more and I'm not sure how to tell her especially because when I needed to be paid in advance she did that for me and gave me $150. I ended up almost working all the days off for it, but she recently just told me that she decided to forget about it and started paying me again, so now I'd feel bad If I told her I need to be paid more

How do I play out my final two weeks when my supervisor and coworkers are taking my resignation personally?,"I have been working with the same company for the past 2 1/2 years. Some of us were part of a major company initiative, and there is a strong since of camaraderie amongst those who were part of it and are still with the company. As a result of my strong work performance and the respect I share with my peers, my boss pegged me as the ""point person"" for my department - which involves setting guidelines and training new employees within my wing of the operation.

*You can imagine their surprise when I put in my two-week notice a few days ago.*

Despite the good vibes mentioned earlier, I had not received a raise or promotion since I started. I met with my boss and supervisor several times, and was told the earliest they could promote me or give me a raise was in 6-7 months from now. I recently took an interview with another company, and offered the promotion and raise I was looking for. I accepted it because it's what's best for my career.

Since my boss and my direct supervisor were both out of the office on the day I received the offer and my start date with the new company is soon, I e-mailed them a professional note announcing my resignation effective in two weeks and thanking them for their support during my time with them. My coworkers' reaction upon finding out from my boss and supervisor have been all over the map.

My supervisor, who I shared a good relationship with, didn't talk to me for three days. When he finally met with me behind closed doors, he berated me for leaving - though also asked if there is any counteroffer the company could make after saying I 'burned a bridge' with him, which was sort of a weird 180. A couple of other coworkers who are part of the ""camaraderie"" still haven't spoken to me. My boss, though he understands my decision, was not shy about mentioning the staffing woes the department is now in (we were understaffed even before I put in notice). On the contrary, one superior  who I thought would be indifferent has become my biggest supporter, wishing me the best and saying the company played itself by not promoting me when they should have.

**My question: how do you play out the remainder of your two-week notice when a handful of your coworkers are taking your professional decision personally?**"
Anyone who realized that what they want to do in life is completely different from what they studied in college? How did you go about it?,"So, I’ve always been interested in many things, which made it hard for me to figure out what I wanted to do in life. I’ve tried both the natural and the social sciences, but eventually went for a BA in English. After all, I loved writing and reading.

After about three years of working, I just realized that writing for a living just isn’t for me. Now, I want to go back to one of my first loves—environment and the natural world. 

How do I bridge this knowledge gap? Literally the only thing I can do is write. Right now, my plan is to work as a writer or communications officer in related agencies, then later pursue a master’s degree once I have enough work experience. Is this the right approach?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Especially someone who also switched from the arts to the sciences? How did you do it? How difficult was it to transition to a completely different field?

**Edit: Thanks so much for all the insight! Definitely gave a me a new perspective and helped reinforce some ideas. Now, at least I know which ones to prioritize and ponder on. I initially planned on replying to everyone, but this exploded and I’m not so sure I could! (Will do my best.)**

I just want to clarify a few things since they’re often brought up:

- I’m currently taking some online courses on the subject to see if I’d really be interested in them, as well as to narrow down my interests. I’m not planning to look for jobs until next year, so I have a lot of time! (Keeping my writing job for now.)
- Once the pandemic dies down, I do plan on volunteering on an environmental advocacy org. It’s a little intimidating because I’ve never done this before, but I do want to have hands-on experience (and network while I’m at it).
- I don’t plan going straight back to school! I really want to have some related experience in the field before I do and be really sure I like the subject. I don’t want to make the same mistake again.
- I know I did say I started to “hate” writing, but I also know that it’s my most marketable skill right now. The positions I’m targeting are definitely writing-related. If this pans out, maybe I’d end up sticking with it, who knows.
- I’m doing content writing right now, which has been really soul-sucking for me. Plus, I’ve also stopped doing creative writing, which was my major and something I thought I’d want to do for the rest of my life. (Hence, the “I hate writing” bit.) But I know there’s more to writing than long-form content and creative works, so I’m now exploring other forms, like technical, social media, and mass media writing, etc. I’m liking them better so far (esp news writing)."
Do others around the age of 30 struggle with career direction?,"I am approaching 30. Work in sales and  have done for just shy of a year, before that I was in a financial  brokerage for a year, and an investment bank for a year. Graduated in Business Management in the UK, on a 4 year with a placement.

The  thing is and this has been the case for all my life and probably is for  many - there's just not something I am so passionate about that I want  to invest all my time specialising in. I left finance because I actually  hated the environment, the people. It was so toxic at one point I  resigned from my brokerage and luckily landed a job in tech sales. It's  now been just shy of a year and there's always so much pressure with  targets and aside from COVID for one moment, your job is under threat  after a period of time if you don't keep up with the numbers.

As  I approach 30, I have come to realise that life ISN'T worth this kind  of stress. And yet I'm earning £50k GBP which is in terms of averages,  pretty decent going for a 29 year old. But it's somehow not important to  me. If anything, it's easy to compare to some of my younger friends who  are in banking and earn even more than that and will continue to earn  more and more. I find myself looking up and thinking I should be doing  better, rather than looking down at say retail workers who earn 20k for  example. Heck, I'm talking to a Brazilian lady on a dating app who is 35  and works in a retail store as well as a restaurant receptionist - I  suddenly look much better than her. It's easy to forget.

But  I think I would be happier if you told me that I found my  girlfriend/wife to be, and was earning 20k, rather than earning say 50k  as I am and being single. There's just nothing that makes me think life  is worth repeating day in day out just to pay a mortgage, retire, and  then die. It just feels so unimportant. I guess I was never lucky enough  to discover my 'passion' from a young age and implement it into my  work. I'm into football but don't want any job around that other than be  a professional football player, which I am not.

I  recently started to look into coding and weigh up whether this would be  worth my time. It's actually interesting, but reading between the lines  it seems that it's going to be very challenging finding work in this  area without a degree, notto mention take years to learn enough to be  job ready.

I just feel kind of  lost and always have done with 'work'. Like there's never been an  underlying purpose/motivation behind it. Anyone else having career blues  around a similar age?"

Is the grass really not greener on the other side?,"I've been a trucker since I left school 10 years ago. Every post I come across are full of people dreading the office culture, politics, environment etc and saying how they'd love to be outdoors.

I work outdoors and it's shit, -5°C in winter and 40+°C in summer. Slogging 12-15 hour days behind the wheel, micro-sleeping and hallucinating just to make delivery times. Getting filthy and soaking wet when working outside.

The idea of being in a nice cooled office, not having to put my life on the line and actually working on a project with a team sounds so stimulating to me instead of being a monkey behind a wheel. But then I see so many people call themselves monkeys in other professions and hate the office.

What is one to do then?"
"COVID19: Can my boss refuse to fire me and just not pay me if I demand to work from home, forcing me to quit?","I am the Sales & Marketing Director for a privately owned assisted living community in Connecticut. It was hard enough to convince people to join our community after the virus hit when we weren’t allowing any more in person tours, family visits, and were COVID-19 free...

But then one of our residents tested positive for the virus after visiting another facility for outpatient services. Several of my community’s workers - CNAs, private duty aides, and food service workers all interacted with the patient in the time after she returned but before she was confirmed to have Covid19.  Most, but not all, were wearing facemasks, gloves, and eye protection during their interactions, but no one was wearing protective gowns or protective footwear. A couple hours ago one of the exposed food service workers was sent home with a 102 degree fever...

I have a wife and several children, all younger than 10 years old. I came into the office today for what I thought was the last time and told my boss that I no longer could come to the community and would instead work from home. I also let him know that if this was not okay, then it would be best to let me go so I could file for unemployment and look for a new job.

About an hour later I hear from the owner of the community who tells me that if I don’t come in and work out of the office, he will no longer pay me and I can quit if I don’t like it. He said he won’t fire me, he just won’t pay me - preventing me from applying for unemployment benefits. When I told him that this was against the law, his reply was, “Sue me, then.”

What the hell can I do?  Can I quit and still collect unemployment?"
How important to you is it to have a good boss?,"In my experience having a good manager/boss can really make the difference between liking and hating a job.

"Lost in job hunt and life, what the hell do I do now?","I’m 35, have a degree in wildlife management. After college spent 4 years running trucks for UPS to put my wife through law school. All the while applying for my dream job. I’ve now been working retail for 7 years and taking care of my two kids while the wife has a successful law career. 

Have applied to my dream job at every chance, and every time, at the last selection process, I’ve been denied with no explanation. I decided that my family was too important for me to keep wasting time. Wanted to stay home and take care of my kids so my wife can pursue her career to the fullest.

She decided to leave me for her boss cause she doesn’t respect me. I’ve never been lower and I’ve never been so lost. I now have to find an actual career, not just a job. 

I’ve looked and applied to every job/career that I can think of that would be appropriate for my degree. I love the outdoors and I love working with wildlife. I have begun looking into getting my pilots license, but that will take a lot of money I don’t really have and a long time to make any money. 

I have to find something to sustain myself and my kids. Big city, small house, small vehicle, all the bills, and no prospects......."
"""We've decided not to fill this position at this time."" Has anyone been getting these emails more frequently given the whole coronavirus situation?","Today I got an email from a position I applied for and as soon as I saw it I thought ""Of course, ANOTHER rejection where they tell me I'm not a good fit."" I was shocked when that wasn't the case. Instead I was greeted with an email stating that the hiring manager decided not to fill the position at this time.

I'm wondering if given the whole situation with the coronavirus that this is happening more often. I know it's possible I could have gotten this even if it weren't happening right now, but I know tons of places are struggling and are currently experiencing hiring freezes. Has anyone else been getting these type of emails recently?"
Why is being human so frowned upon in the corporate world?,"I have years of experience in Corporate America. And what I've noticed is that employers couldn't care less about you as a person. You are to do your job, fall in line, and obey the chain of command, and that's it. Try to insert your personality into that? Not going to happen. Try to help improve morale by treating others like human beings and speaking up about what's wrong? Not going to go over well.

I have seen so many workplaces with so many miserable employees, and the root cause of it is that being human is not allowed. It's all about image and employees know that if they break away from that, even if it's to do the morally and ethically correct thing, they're going to be labeled ""trouble"" and they're not going to rise in the ranks. It's not right.

It's no wonder that people call the corporate world ""soul-sucking"" and are counting down the days until they can escape. It is truly a demoralizing place to be."
"I've been unhappy with my job for a while and was looking to leave at this time, but now I feel stuck because of COVID. What are some good ideas to consider moving forward?","I’m sure I’m one of MANY people posting about this same problem, so I’ll first just apologize about this in advance. I’ll also preface this post by saying that I know I’m fortunate to not be out of work right now.

I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job for some time now, and right around this time was when I was planning to look for another one (ironically, I had gone on a trip before COVID-19 broke out and my plan was to do this after I got back home). In summary, here are the reasons why:

* Long hours, understaffing and me agreeing to way too much in the past year has led to me wearing far too many hats. I’m burnt out, never able to complete everything each week and management is aware, but doesn’t seem to do anything about it.
* My role has changed from one where I was supposed to be a creative contributor to my company to one where I just manage and oversee logistics all day. It wasn’t what I signed up to do and I don’t even get to do any of the responsibilities I was originally given when I started (which was work I actually enjoyed, is in line with my skill set and that was valuable for both the company and my resume). Duties that were once mine are now just outsourced by third parties and managed by me. It's definitely not the same thing as what I joined to do, at all.
* Management knows I want to go back to my original duties and have repeatedly told me they will do this for me and reevaluate processes, only to then keep roping me into the very duties (mentioned above) that keep me from doing just that and doing absolutely nothing they promise.
* Management is young, inexperienced and not good at fixing problems when they’re brought to attention. This results in me and other colleagues getting the brunt of other people’s problems.
* According to market trends (at least before COVID), I was being underpaid and overworked for this role. I’m not sure if this still stands now.

Overall, I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now and I don’t feel like this job is at all aligned with my career goals at all. I’ve managed to keep my job and work from home during the pandemic, which makes me feel like an even bigger POS for complaining. But with that being said, I can tell that taking our company online is already starting to worsen the lack of organization and alignment. On top of stress over what’s happening in the world right now, I know my mental health is not in great shape dealing with this role. Even prior to this, I was dealing with working late hours, extreme burnout and lack of sleep. I still want to make the best of my life and my career during this time and I know I’m not doing it here.

With all this being said, I am perfectly happy with working from home (I'm a bit of an introvert and actually fare really well with it) and the type of work I do is very easy to do remotely. Is it worth the risk to still look for something else right now or am I making a bad move? I’d love to know if anyone else has greater insight on the remote market right now or what that’s looking like. It's been over a year since I've looked for a job and I've never looked for a wholly remote opportunity before."
Mid 30’s feel like I wasted my time studying for something I’m not working in. Am I alone in this?,"Hi everyone. So I did the whole college thing, while I was finishing my post graduate degree I started working retail. Now where I’m from retail paid really well so I stuck to that. I blinked and suddenly I was 8 years in the retail game. I finally got out and moved on to something that I thought was academics but is really a glorified call center (no hate on the company it’s just being managed really badly, and I can’t deal with it anymore). I wanted to get into the academics world because my degree is in School Psychology (MA), I’ve applied for a teaching license and have been denied, I can’t find any work right now 1. Because I have the degree but no certifications plus no experience and 2. Because of COVID (I’m in one of the high number cases states). I’m literally at my wits end and don’t know how to move on from where I’m at mentally."
What are some good paying jobs that are repetitive and easy?,Imma be real with y'all. I'm a simple man. I have a college degree but I don't know what to do with it and I'm just trying to find a good paying job that's low stress and easy to learn. Any advice on what job or field I should look into?
"If the unemployment rate is 3.6, why is it still so hard to get a job?","I always learned that the lower the unemployment rate the easier it was to find a job since so there are not so many people available to work. 

Today’s climate seems like it’s nearly impossible the get a job.  I applied for over 50 jobs and haven’t gotten one interview yet even though they are all in my industry. 

Can someone explain it to me? I thought I’d be flooded with interviews"
What if I legitimately don’t have any passions?,"I’ve been in this life decision limbo for years. 

I understand my job does not have to directly be my passion, just something that allows me to pursue that passion. But what if I truly don’t have one thing in life that I see myself doing for the rest of my life? 

I just graduated and while I have little hobbies of yoga, hanging with my dog and friends, shopping,  and smoking weed-I don’t know if any of that defines me. They’re also pretty basic and generic to try and mold your life around. I mean I know yoga can be a big part of life, but I think for me it’s just a way to relieve stress and pain. I think my lack of passion is proved by the fact that I have absolutely nothing enjoyable to do with all this free unemployed time while away from friends. I hate it. 

My one and only dream has been to have my own beautifully decorated studio apartment in the city with my dog. And one day far away, a mom. I literally just want to be independent. It’s hard to get there without any understanding of who you want to be. Maybe it’s because I have depression, but I’m not actually sad right now, just lost.

EDIT: thank you all for these responses. I’ve been trying to take pauses in between my day and read them all. I will keep trying to reply the next day or two because I’m learning with each response!

I understand I don’t have to have a true passion. I just want to figure out what I can literally just TOLERATE. I KNOW I find passion in anything I feel adequate in, that will reward in itself. I just don’t feel good at anything but I know it’s not true."
"CANNOT think of ANYTHING that I want to do as a career. It's so frustrating! I've been researching it for years and I'm at my wit's end. Help. I can't do retail anymore, I might go insane. How do I choose when nothing seems to call to me?","When I was a kid, I wanted to be a teacher. Then it turned into a book writer, then I switched to architecture. none of those panned out but I still think about them.

some other ones I've been interested in: entertainer, librarian, lawyer, doctor (lofty, I know, but why not), musician, artist. Just all over the place.

My parents have told me that I should do something creative but that's never panned out. 

And then there's the fact that so many people I know went through the whole college thing and now they're secretaries or working in retail and it scares me and confuses me. What if I waste my money? what if I can't hack it? what if my IQ is low and that's why I have nothing to show? I am so stressed about this. I'm terrified to go back to retail (I quit before covid and now I'm in quarantine-- how am I supposed to get a job like that when I live with vulnerable age groups?!?!!)

Anything you got for me would be a great help. Thank you so much."
Anyone else ever just feel like it’s over?,"34 years old.

How do i gracefully handle a coworker who blurts out unreasonable deliverables as being easily achievable during meetings without making him out to be a fool?,"Have a coworker who blurts out unreasonable deliverables on the reg during meetings. It would be fine if it was just him digging his own grave(which he does constantly). The problem is when he does this with the work of other people. 

Lets name him ""Blurt""

**Meeting about website & app**

Me: i think we might need to invest 10,000usd minimum in order to properly create version 1 of our web app 

Blurt:  Definitely possible with 2500 usd. I know a guy and a few companies.

[When i asked him later (giving the benefit of the doubt. cost saving is wonderful after all) he said what he meant by he knew someone was that he talked to someone on the phone once. When he said he knew companies, he just heard of them. FML. ]

**Discussing SEO blog content**

Marketing manager: We've all agreed on a budget of 50-150 usd per high quality article but ive found a freelancer who can do 20 usd per post with a reasonably good portofolio

Blurt: Oh thats too expensive! We can get cheaper. Its just writing.

So on and so forth. 

For the sake of team cohesion and morale i dont want to make a fool of him yet id like to bring him back to reality a bit. 

Whats your advice?

Hes generally a good person, just a bit insecure therefore has an ego."
"Is it worth it to leave a high paying job that makes me miserable, for one that pays less but doesn't make me cry daily?","&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

&#x200B;

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking ""Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?""

&#x200B;

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

&#x200B;

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever. I genuinely feel like I am doing something wrong, or I'm a bad person, for feeling this way. I want anything else, literally anything else. Is this a horrible mistake?"
Wtf do people do for a living where they can buy houses and range rovers?,"I’m 26, and I don’t know what I want to do for a career. I’ve had over 25 jobs (mostly pertaining to event staffing and restaurants). Ive also moved a dozen times to different cities. As you can see I have a really hard time “sticking” to things, mostly fueled by the curiosity of “what else is out there” 
I’ve been back and forth school, changed majors like 6 times. I usually do something math/science oriented but find a reason to stop going like “i can’t get a job in that field” or “it’s boring.” I get straight A’s and I’m a hard worker and I’ve made some decent tips but I’m just ready to make a real salary. I don’t understand what it takes, where to start, how to find something I can do. I live in an area where houses are $1 million dollars and I just don’t get how so many people can afford it and it frustrates me. I’m afraid of shifting around BS jobs for years to come and having nothing to show for it. Please help me figure out what to do. I’m currently in trade school for electrical but I’m not sure if the field is right for me either.

Edit: THANK YOU everyone who responded. Your advice is indispensable and I definitely gained a better understanding of how to succeed. I’ll stick with trade school and root myself in that field. Thanks again :-)"
"After searching for about a year, I finally got a job! I'm really happy, but am intensely worried about office politics. A slight hint of it stresses me out so much. Any advice for the mindset to adopt or a way to present myself to move away from politics?","I generally exude a friendly and easygoing disposition, as that is the person I am trying to be. I was a very judgemental and aloof person in the past and want to change that, have been changing that. I don't ever wanna go back there, but I worry that office politics is gonna occur, and I worry I don't know how to handle feelings of injustice or indignance. I want to enjoy being hired by a company I admire (even though I have heard that it's quite political, but these are all hearsays), and enjoy finally not being unemployed and not having a chaotic routine. I just wanna have a great time there. All these fears crept up to me today as I interacted with an employer via email and felt that ache in my chest."
Does the thought of work make anyone anxious?,"Something upsetting will happen at work and I’ll feel really anxious all night or weekend about it (then it ruins whatever nice thing I have going on). It could be an argument between a colleague and I (they have been rude to me, I defend myself and then bamb...anxiety on the rumours, perceptions and so on), work I don’t really understand and have to present (the fear of being caught out for not knowing and being grilled), and so on. 

I think it’s even worse because I’m only a few months into my job and know it’s not for me. I’m trying to be smart and wait for another role. It’s just makes me feel really awful if I’m honest. Any experience? It would be great to get some tips? 

And yes I am applying for a new job."
Fired for insubordination. How to handle conversation in future interviews?,"Hello Career Guidance,

I was fired 2 weeks ago due to insubordination regarding holding my team accountable to the attendance policy. Senior Management told all managers to write up their hourly teams if they called in during the COVID-19 outbreak, and long story short I had my team disregard that. I just got called by our HRBP saying  that I was marked as unrehirable.  How should I handle this conversation when it pops up in interviews? Thanks for any advice."

I’m not taking care of myself. But it pays ok and I don’t know what else I would do. I’d like to take the parts of this job that I enjoy-or used to enjoy-and combine them in one role but I don’t think that exists or haven’t been able to find anything close that pays what I need.

"25y/o homeless disabled single mom, college dropout, dumpster fire work history. Can I still be a lawyer and if so, how do I even begin to work on this goal?","I dropped out of college a semester before graduating. Otherwise, I was a successful student on track to graduate with a dual degree BS/BA in Geography and International Relations, respectively, that following Spring.

I worked in direct services/social work, mostly really grimey, poorly paid, street outreach with the homeless. Hard work, long hours, lots of hearing people's traumas, so much stress. Really hated it. I bounced between jobs a lot. Some of it was my fault, some of it wasn't. I really wasn't great at it. I don't think I have any possible references.

Yada yada yada, I'm now a homeless single mom living of of SSI and food stamps, no family or friends to support me. Honestly, it sucks. It really sucks. I just want to be able to make a living wage and be able to afford a home. I don't even know how to hodgepodge together anything and I just feel so lost.

I YOLO quit my job - what is next?,"I am a 24M who graduated with an engineering degree in April 2018. I have been working in a large company in an entry level contract position for 13 months. 

For the past 9 months, I have been supporting two vacant full time employee positions. Each of the two roles has two separate groups of stakeholders and I am caught in the middle trying to please both while seeming incompetent to both as I consistently cannot complete all of the work assigned. 

My commute is approximately 4 hours per day with work hours typically between 8-12 hours. This often results in 12-16 hour days without paid overtime or time off in lieu. 

Senior management has recently started gaslighting me which is really making me question my own sanity. As a result, I walked out of my workplace on Tuesday and haven't returned. I recently liquidated all my investments to ensure I have enough cash to survive unemployment. 

Have any of you been in the same situation? Am I making the right decision? What steps should I take to find a career path that truly interests me? Is it worth a trip to a psychiatrist or my local unemployment office to see if I am eligible for any assistance?

Apologies for the haphazard questions - all advice is truly welcome."
How can I turn a social media platform into job experience?,"So this is a painfully Gen Z question. 

I'm a fashion business student and I recently gained over 100K followers on Tiktok by making videos of me talking about random subjects, making jokes, etc. (nothing vulgar and no dancing or anything). I feel like this platform could be a great addition to my resume if I only knew what to do with it. Does anyone have any ideas for how to turn this into job experience that may be relevant in my field (ex. selling merch, doing brand deals, etc.) and how would you word those types of things on a resume?

Who changed their career to something completely different in their 30s or later?,"As someone who is currently happy to still have a job but nevertheless deeply unsatisfied with their work life, I was wondering about stories of people who have changed to something completely different after 10 or so years in an industry.

Like banker to electrician, or programmer to language teacher. Whatever, that kind of stuff."
Should you go to an interview 45 minutes early?,"NO!

Sure get to the building an hour or 45 minutes early if you have no idea where you are going or are taking public transit. But don't go IN until MAXIMUM 20 minutes prior, ideally 10 minutes before, showing you are prompt but not overzealous.

And then if you DO go in early and the administrator/receptionist tells you it's in your best interest to take off and come back 10-15 minutes prior to your interview BELIEVE THEM! Sure you can wait there but you are going to look awkward as fuck and if it's a good place HR will ask that person what vibe they got off you. 'Arrived very early and then didn't trust my advice about the company I work for' isn't going to fly.

You don't have to go buy a coffee. Hell go wait in the lobby of another office building ( who cares if THEY think you are odd) but don't sit for 40+ minutes in the lobby of the company you want to work for.

Edit: okay I'm not going to respond to everyone or anything, y'all can read comment or the billion articles on this shit. If you have basic North American office rules and found a job without it then great for you. I too have arrived at the building of my interview an hour early ( public transit) and then gone elsewhere to wait. Honestly I expected like 3 upvotes or downvotes and then for this thread to die. I was just blowing off steam.

Here's the golden rule. If the administrator/receptionist tells you to make yourself scarce until x amount of time prior DO IT. They are VERY unlikely to have any interest in you failing and know their office better than you do, listen to them."
"Why do people assume just because you love a hobby (esp if you excel at it in amateur levels), that you will love doing it for a living? Has anyone found out how hard the pro leagues can be the hard way?","We always hear stuff like ""follow your dreams!"" and the best recipe for successful wealth is ""pick something you love so much an make a career out of it!"".

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic? Why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living, but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job? 

Its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula! But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

Has anyone here tried to go for the NBA or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is? Even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games?

Please put your examples when you tried to go pro when you were younger!"
Is there hope for a 29 year old with no career?,"So basically, I'm a 29 year old Guy who doesn't really have a career. What bothers me is, I really don't feel pulled in any particular direction. I have passion for life, but just don't identify with a notion headed towards a specific career, which is troubling. I have pretty decent school results (UK), but no university degree.

I've had jobs before, like stores as a teenager, and worked for a while in the airport (a job my Dad got me), but I always had trouble with my family, wound up feeling disconnected from life and myself and developed drug addictions in my late teens, which got worse in my early 20s, which spiraled and wound up with me on Government assistance and schizoaffective disorder. But now I'm 29 and I've managed to quit drugs and restore my sanity and would like to contribute to society (and my own well being, since work is good for that).

I just need to *pick something*.. It's very frustrating to have the will but not know which way to go (not even slightly. I rack my brains and there's nothing). I hope somebody here can help guide me in the right direction."
Is it normal for a 26 year old to not know what to do?,"I am 26, in couple months 27. I don't know what I want to do in life as a career and I'm scared as shit."
How do I stop trying to get personal validation from my job?,"Hey friends, sorry if the title isn't totally clear. Basically I had an epiphany yesterday, after I went the extra mile and busted my butt at my job for a project that turned out to not be worth the trouble. I'm on the east coast of the US, and one of our clients is in Alaska, so a four hour time difference. They told us a file had to be finished by the end of the day, so I decided to give up my plans for Friday night and bring my work laptop home so I could hop on as soon as I got an email from the client. But by the time their office closed at 9pm my time they hadn't gotten around to doing their end of things yet, so I had just wasted my evening for nothing. 

This type of thing is a pretty rare occurrence at my job, so this event is not a huge deal per se. I'm grateful I rarely have to take work home with me after hours. However, I just felt sort of disproportionately embarrassed and foolish for putting in that  much effort and giving up my plans for what turned out to be something less important than I thought it was. After some self reflection I realized I'm trying to somehow derive love and self-worth from my job, which is basically impossible in a corporate environment. I think it was drilled into me as a kid that my education was the most important thing, above social and other commitments, and I've just carried it over into my working life without realizing it.

I'm very grateful for my friends and family that give me social and emotional satisfaction, as well as my hobbies, but I guess I have still not come to terms that my job is just a job, not my life's calling, and doesn't give me much besides money and something to leave the house for. I guess basically my question is, how do you deal with the fact that your job isn't the center of your life? How do you begin to separate how you define yourself from how you spend the majority of your waking hours? Sorry if this is a little too philosophical or over-thinking things. I just haven't gotten it into my head yet that I can't just keep working harder until I earn self-esteem.

TL;DR: Just realized I'm stupidly trying to put in enough effort for a soulless corporate to love me and validate my existence somehow. Have others dealt with this epiphany, and how did you start to derive your self-worth elsewhere?

EDIT: Wow I didn't even know that awards on a post was a thing. I'm just glad so many people found this relatable. Thanks guys!"
Should I accept a job offer where I can make a years salary in 75 days?,"Some background information - I’m 19 years old currently work on night crew at a grocery store making $12.20 an hour and make around $25,000 a year. I still live with my parents and am saving up to try and get my own place and eventually want to acquire some rental properties. At the rate I am currently making money it just isn’t cutting it and I need something to speed up the process. 

I was recently offered a position on a fishing trawler boat as a processor where I stand to make $30,000 for 75 days of work. I’d be working 16 and a half hour days, 7 days a week. I have never worked nearly that hard in my entire life it’s hard for me to imagine that kind of work. 

Financially, the smartest thing to do would be accept the position and just try to muscle out those 75 days, but I’m just not sure if I am capable. I want to do the job but it’s hard to imagine myself working 16 hour days when I struggle some days just working 8. Yet another part of me wants to push myself and if I were finish those 75 days it would launch me so much further financially. I know if I can just suffer through that time it would be a big step in my life. I’m just not sure what to do and would appreciate any advice"
Will remote offices become the new standard?,"I feel like more and more companies are shifting toward a remote-centric culture and I'm worried traditional offices won't exist anymore.

I hate working remotely. I can't focus, I hate having to stay in my house all day, I hate the lack of social interactions (despite being a socially anxious introvert), and I feel like I am missing out on a lot of perks.

Where I work, they have a lot of free food around the office, which had allowed me to save A TON of money on groceries when I was working there as an intern, and now I don't have access to that anymore. I was relying on onboarding to make new friends outside my department, but I doubt it'll be happening now. How are you supposed to make friends on Zoom and Slack?

Everyone else seems to love it, but I need the structure of an office. I'm *less* productive when I'm at home and I actually don't mind a commute. It allows me to separate home life from work life. When I'm working from home, those lines become blurred. That, combined with the fact that I end up having to work longer hours because of my lack of productivity, makes me feel like I'm always at work. My house is no longer a place of relaxation, it's all stress. I don't think co-working spaces are an option either. It's like working alone at the library except it's insanely expensive.

Does anyone else feel the same way? Am I in a minority?"
Has anyone here changed jobs because of 1 coworker?,"I work at a small family run office that totals maybe around 25 people total. I am in a more supportive role, so collaborations with other heads of departments is critical to my job.

Enter $NastyCoworker. $NastyCoworker is tasked with running the day to day operations of an important part of the company. $NastyCoworker's direct boss is also my direct boss.

There have been several incidents with her that I won't lengthen the post with, but what may have been the final straw for me was a meeting I had recently. I am working on a project for my Direct boss and $NastyCoworker, to make their workflow in our system smoother. I followed the requirements, with only a few minor things that can get changed down the line as we continue to improve the system. My mistake: I didn't get the changes my boss and $NastyCoworker requested in writing.

Well $NastyCoworker didn't like the changes at all. Started up on a soap box about how she is never listened to and how I wasted all this time on changes that she didn't want. Basically saying openly in a meeting that I am incompetent. My boss basically tiptoed around her the entire meeting and once we got done with the meeting I called him directly and he agreed that she was off her rocker and I had made changes she wanted. He seems to think she has some bias against me because I am so much younger than her and in her eyes I am a kid. (I'm 3 years out of college). He then said he would speak with her about how ""This behavior cannot continue"", but I have already heard through the grapevine that it was the same old slap on the wrist with nothing actually being done.


I often think about leaving if a new job comes up but other than this one person this job isn't that bad, it's just that I am forced into collaborating with someone so awful."
Only work about 3 actual hours per day (non salaried) and boss is non the wiser and thinks I do good work. Should I tell her the reality?,"I work as a staff accountant for a credit union, and other than the month-end closing periods, I only do about 3 hours of actual dedicated work per day. 

This is not because I'm lazy, but because I have fine tuned/automated my processes to such a level that all of my work is completed by noon most days.

I am starting to get bored, and want more projects to work on. However, I don't want to do more work for the same pay. 

Im hoping that if I show my boss how much I get done in such a little amount of time, she will be impressed and request to increase my pay, while also giving me more stuff to do. 

Is this risky? Will I be shooting myself in the foot and get more work for no additional pay?. Any positives?

Thanks in advance.

Edit- Obligatory, Wow this blew up!. Thanks for your responses.

Some clarification, I'm not saying I won't do more work without a raise, moreso that I want to set an expectation that the value of doing extra work warrants a raise/promotion at the next review. My boss is very laid back and likes me as an employee, but in the end it's the CFO who approves/disapproves raises"
“Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.” Bill Gates said it. Can you commit to being supportive to this community?,"When I hear people on this sub telling others:

* Get used to the grind
* You're not supposed to like your job
* Just appreciate the situation that you're in, some people don't even have a job!
* Hey, that's just how it is - when you're 35/40/45, you get used to it

It hurts me so much that people are spreading this message. It's not the truth. If you aren't happy with your job, don't make that sadness/resignation someone else's reality. 

If you didn't know the story of the 50 year old architect... 

>A woman had lived her life wanting to be an architect but never having the means to do it. At 40, she finally did. Those around her told her ""It's going to take you 10 years to become an architect with the amount of time you can afford to commit to school."" She knew it would take her a long time, but she also knew that (God willing) the ten years was going to pass anyway, and at the end of those ten years, she would be an architect or not.

In ten years you are going to be \*fill-in-the-blank\* or not, so what's your plan? 

Some of us have those 10 years. Whether it's you or I that doesn't, let's prop people up and support their dreams. If you see this, can you commit to that support?

"To those who have “made it”, can you share your background?","Those people who have “made it” in life, a few questions:
1) Your definition of “making it”
2) What do you do? 
3) How much do you make? 
4) How did you get there? (College, mentorship, etc)
5) Biggest piece of advice for those feeling lost (failures and successes along the way)

To expand on #1, everyone’s definition of “making it” is surely different.  In my mind, I will truly have made it when I have a beautiful home, couple new cars, can vacation a few times a year, go to a job that I enjoy where my work has a positive impact, and share all of this with a family.  I have a long way to go to achieve these goals and am looking forward to reading your success stories for motivation.  Thanks!"

However, since I've been working from home I've had absolutely no motivation to complete even the core basics of my job. There are no longer projects coming in to keep my interest, and it's all back to data entry again. I know it's bad to let my mind wander and do other things during my work time, but I just can't convince myself that it's worth it anymore. Hell, I've even been putting my data analyst skills to work by collecting measurements of my houseplants and compiling and graphing the data from them, but I just keep avoiding doing my actual job. I really gotta stop and calm myself down, especially since finding a more interesting job will be impossible with the covid recession and businesses are not hiring."

Remote work during COVID to permanent remote work?,"I’ve been working from home during COVID and honestly it’s been great for me. Don’t get me wrong, I am so sad for how this virus has upended so many lives. But my company responded fast and told us to stay home starting in early March and since then I’ve had so much peace and contentment. 

Since working from home my professional and personal productivity has skyrocketed. I’ve been keeping up on work, starting a podcast, rebranding myself on social media, lost 20 lbs, read a few great books, used henna on my hair. With all of this good energy flowing, I’ve realized how draining it is for me to sit in an office all day. I enjoy my work but I’ve never liked being in an office all day long. It’s something that I dreaded earlier in my career and now I’ve just accepted it/gotten used to it. And I’ve tried to look for remote work before but couldn’t really find anything. 

This time has opened my eyes and I cannot go back to spending 40 in an office. I have no desire to do it. Prior to this covid crisis, the company reserved remote work for employees who had been w/the company 10+ years. It’s a family owned business and even one of the family members who had been there only a few years wasn’t allowed to work from home. But I’ve heard whispers that maybe they’ll see now that this is a possibility for us. I’ve been candid with my direct supervisor about wanting remote work. He wasn’t able to provide any information about where the company was at on the next reopening phase for us, but he seemed to understand. And I know many other colleagues feel like I do. 

My question is this:  is there anything I can do to move the needle on this? At this point it feels incredibly important for me to advocate for my needs. 

TLDR:  working from home has given me super productivity, peace and happiness and I need advice on how I can advocate for permanent remote work."
"Have you ever been a ""bad employee"" in one company but then became a good one in another?","Left a job months ago because toxic workplace/not a good fit but still in contact with old coworkers. One of my old coworkers became my replacement and they ask/tell me things about the things I used to be responsible for. I still talk to them because they've become friends and I help out because I feel guilty for leaving them.

Now, there are some problems that surfaced (that I wasn't aware of during my time there). Sometimes I feel like the only reason they're talking to me is just so they can rub my mistakes in my face or something (emphasis on feel, I don't think that they are the kind of people to do something like that intentionally).

I got a new job and I am excited. But talking to this old coworker is making me feel anxious and scared and making me feel all the things I used to feel back then, like hating myself and feeling like I am not able to do anything right.

I just want to know if anyone else felt like that they were a bad employee but became a good one in a new company.

TLDR; I think I was a bad employee in my old company. Can I still be a good one in a new company?

Edit: Thank you for your responses. I sincerely appreciate all of them and you guys really are helping me with your own experiences and advice. Stay safe everyone!

Edit 2: Edited text to clear things up. I've also pinpointed why I feel bad (and feeling what I am feeling now). I have made mistakes at the old job and I feel like everything is my fault whenever said coworker talks to me regarding work because those things were my responsibilties before. I am now scared of being a bad employee again at this new job and I don't want to be."
I want to work at an Oreo factory?,Today I was eating Oreos and I realized that Oreos are my passion and I want to work for them.
My boss is giving my $8000 commission to another employee - How would you handle this?,"My boss gave my commission to another employee

I’ll try to summarize this, but I work in a high commission recruiting firm - placements typically earn you anywhere from $3,000-$12,000 Net commission - with that obviously comes a relatively low base salary. ($31,200 for the year)

I don’t want to do anything dumb because I’m new to my career and just graduated last May from college - but I quit my previous position at a 50k base to come here because the long term commission structure was so much higher.

Brief edit - the other recruiter works remote, there was no way to tell this candidate was spoken to because he didn’t follow policy.

 Me and a fellow co worker had spoken to a candidate however he had spoken to him a few hours prior and put him in for the position - however the employee did not follow any of the company policies. 

For anyone who has recruited you understand that the tracking system for candidates is huge to protect people’s work, I had actually qualified the candidate, gotten his updated resume, verified him, and added him to the system with him in my name and added notes. While the other worker briefly spoke to him, submitted him with an incorrect resume and was off the phone in 2 minutes. our company policy strictly states this means that it would go into my name because I had him in the database. because the other recruiter ignored all of this and the candidate had both of us submit him to the job (candidates can be sneaky like that sometimes)

Long story short the guy got the job and I’m looking at a $8500 commission minimum - but the owner is saying he might give it to the other employee because they’re friends and he’s been there for a while. The lead recruiter (my direct boss) is telling me how it’s not fair and if I wasn’t new then it would of at least been split 50-50. 

These placements take months to make, and I took a massive pay decrease to come to this company for this reason of high commission trades - but all my work is being stolen essentially in this instance, and I’m about to move closer to work in the next month or two so I don’t want to commit to a company if this is something which is going to constantly happen. 

Just want to hear your opinion on this because it’s going to bother me long terms and I genuinely cannot live off this base salary and dealing with student loans / rent at the same time when I can get a job with a 25-35% higher base salary in two weeks. My boss constantly is impressed with how hard I work and had fired 5 of the 11 recruiters in the office during the corona situation but kept me even though I was the newest - he texts me often to show his appreciation for my work and how it’ll all pay off soon - but then he goes and does this, it’s just hard to think past that."
"Achieved my dream job, but am now realizing that maybe money is more important to me? Anyone have any advice?","I’m 27 years old and got the job I always said I wanted as a kid. I became a zookeeper. I went to school and got my bachelors degree in Environmental Science and have now been working as a zookeeper for a little over 2 years. I absolutely love the job and wake up most days happy to go to work. Growing up I listened to the advice of “do something you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life”. Which I guess is true but I am now realizing it may not be feasible/sustainable to live off of the amounted income for the rest of my life. There is pretty much no room for growth, very little to no pay raises or promotions, and you make the same amount as someone who has been working there for 30 years. 
I love the job and the work but I think my life outside of work is more important to me. Having to work weekends and holidays isn’t ideal. Paying rent, bills, buying groceries is tough with this pay and I have no savings accumulating. After having worked my ‘dream job’ and knowing what it is like, I have decided that making more money is more important to me to be able to have a better life outside of work.

How can I find a job that doesn’t treat me like garbage?,"I (28F) cannot remember the last time a job did not treat me like garbage. For 5 years now I have worked in many different jobs where I have been bullied by adults/superiors. 

This mostly occurred when I was a teacher being treated poorly by admin and parents. But now I am an office manager at a school  and the director treats me like the “uneducated  help”. Mind you I have my masters and only took this job to escape the garbage treatment at my last job. 

I am very good at my job. According to everyone. But this director just speaks down to people and is so scatterbrained and incompetent herself. She speaks down to everyone. 

I’m ready to move on. HOWEVER after spending so long being treated like shit and going to a new place and being treated like shit and having this cycle repeat itself over and over, I feel so scared. Like why do I keep being treated so terribly by people on power trips? 

How do I avoid it? Is it possible? Is there a career out there that DOESNT treat people like shit?

I’m not looking for royal treatment. Just not to be talked down to and bullied and treated like a moron."
Is it morally wrong to choose a career that doesn't work to solve the world's most severe problems?,"I'm 22 and just graduated college. Naturally, I'm focusing on establishing a career. I've always been interested in the concept of work. Ever since the end of high school, I've thought a lot about why people work and how to have a fulfilling career. This is easily the aspect of my life which I seem to value most, although this value comes from a sense of duty/social obligation rather than my own interest. So there's this question that's been bugging me for awhile.

As I explore different career paths people are pursuing, I can't help but notice that so many of them seem to be kind of... worthless. I make this statement with a lot of skepticism because I don't want to be judgmental with so little information. It's just that I notice so many problems happening in the world: hunger, disease, mental illness, violent crime, oppression, war, poor education, accidents, etc. However, few of these issues are directly effecting me. I live a comfortable life of abundance, security, and all the pleasures one could ask for. Some of this is a result of my own doing, as I enjoy rewards I have earned, but far more of it is just a result of circumstance. I was born in the USA, I'm intelligent, I'm able-bodied, I have a close family, I had access to relatively good education, to name a few of my blessings. But I earned none of this. I don't feel guilty for winning the lottery of circumstance, but I do feel guilty for not helping those who didn't. So here's my question: **is it morally wrong to pursue a career that primarily serves or benefits those on the higher end of the quality of life scale instead of dedicating one's life to solve the world's more severe problems?**

I realize that it's difficult to measure the value produced by, say, a film studio. What if someone is inspired by a movie and decides to travel to a third world country and build a school? But still, it seems that a film studio is just a bunch of people spending time, money, and energy playing with cameras and lights, like a game, when there's people in the world who don't have food. How about another example, a marketing firm that works with fashion brands to sell more expensive sunglasses? I mean seriously? You're working day in and day out to push pieces of plastic people wear on their face so they're a little more comfortable seeing outside? While people are dying of infections diseases because they don't have sanitation infrastructure? Or how about a business accountant? Crunching numbers to make sure you're getting the best tax return so that you can pay your dividends to shareholders so they can buy a new set of golf clubs to hit balls around on huge grass fields where homeless people would be kicked out for sleeping because they have nowhere else to go? I know my perspective is limited and ill informed, but there is truth to the basic concept: people spend resources solving comparatively minor problems when there are very serious issues affecting others in the world.

**What do you think about this? Is it morally wrong to not try to solve the world's biggest problems, if you have the ability to do so? If so, how might we change this about the world? How do we motivate people to create value where is more needed?**"
Is a bad boss a good enough reason to quit my job?,"I (25f) was the first to be hired in a Marketing role at my company about 6-7 months ago. I've been working on anything design branding and marketing for both print and digital however I've had no say in anything, that includes the copy content or often times how something should look. Reason being is that the COO thinks herself a marketer.

Now to give you a background she's a year 9 highschool drop out who started to date the CEO who made her the COO of the company. Because she finds marketing ""fun"" she constantly takes over my role and produces quite terrible work. 

She tells me I don't understand how ""academic"" think so I couldn't produce good work (I have multiple degrees, diploma, and certification). I find how she talks and does work honestly insulting to marketing and design industry to be quite honest let alone to the company as a whole.

The staff are kind and I'm happy with the pay but she drives me mental every.single.day. at 25 I'm happy to have someone wiser to teach me and guide me in bettering my skills but with her at the most, I'll just develop bad skills.

I'm a one person department with no one else to speak to...

I decided to start looking for new jobs...lets just hope with COVID-19 I do find something but am I being immature? I know there's always someone or something in the company but after 6 months I can't imagine her to change and she'll obviously always be in the picture.

Just an update: I'd never quit without a job lined up and plenty of financial resources.
I'm from Australia, so health services is not really an issue and Covid-19 has not impacted us as badly.

I don't mean to bring insult to anyone without an education. I'm the first to graduate in my family...heck, my dad can barely read and I find him wisest of all :)"
Does HR suck at every company in the world?,"Long story but ill try to keep it short; i got a great job at offer with shorter hours at a different firm in September.

The offer they gave me had every detail about the job with benefits and they asked me to start the process of quitting my job, which i did.

Do people think cubicles are soundproof???,"Question might be confusing, but basically I work in a typical office environment. Cubicles in the middle of a large square room, offices on the outside. My team occupies roughly 1/3 of the offices and cubicles. There is one cubicle the team often gathers around intermittently for group/work conversation, and often times it devolves into discussions about other people in the workplace not on our team. Some of these people are literally sitting in the next cubicle over. Some of them might be team members of someone in a cubicle. Some of them might be in an office with the door open across the room...

It gets super awkward standing there when someone is getting trash talked and they or their friends can obviously hear it. I want in no way to be associated with it so I just slowly pull out my phone and back away... but god damn no wonder our team struggles to get along with the other departments. Workplace bullshit like that is absurd, and it’s especially frustrating when bosses who should be bridging gaps just jump on the train as well"
Does anyone else feel like all careers and jobs are boring?,"There are some careers that sound kind of cool and interesting to me on the surface level, but the moment I actually start learning about it and getting into the details of it, I quickly get bored and give up."
I’m partially responsible for my coworkers’ pregnancy losses- how do I fix this?,"I work at a 50-person “young” startup. The oldest person is 36. I’m the first mom they hired. I’m also not Protestant (lack the Protestant Work Ethic )& from a culture where sick days are more comMon. I’m about 6 months in. 

I caught a sinus infection about a month ago and called in sick one AM. My boss told me they NEEDED me for a meeting & could I take the next day off. Fine. I came in. 

The following day, I got a call at 9:30 that they couldn’t spare me & I needed to come in. I wouldn’t be docked sick time. 

This dance went on for about 3 weeks with my coworkers getting increasingly agitated. 

A week in, a single guy (my level)  confronted me in the kitchen, “I don’t want you in here breathing where people eat.”

I came back with, “You’re not my boss; you don’t own this company. If they keep cancelling my sick leave I will go anywhere in the office I please.” Not professional but I was so hurt & frustrated. 

Next day, a female (also my level) texted me: If you come in, I’m meeting with HR today to tell them you need to stop. 

Me: Please make that appointment; my boss keeps denying me sick leave. I’m no happier than you are. 

All the while I had people telling me to “stop being sick”, muttering “please stop” when I coughed, etc. 

Ultimately what broke the stand-off was I collapsed & ended up in the ER. A doctors note finally convinced my boss but HR made sure EVERYONE heard about it. 

By then, a couple others in the office had caught my bug. The Text lady caught it and a cycle of IVF didn’t work as a result. Another guy caught it & his wife lost one twin she was carrying. 

People were crying in the big conference room last Friday. On one hand, I feel terrible I got everyone sick... on another I’m kind of furious my boss kept ordering me in. It’s not all my fault but that’s how people appear to be framing it. 

I could have worn a mask & I need to live with that.  I should have been allowed to take sick leave though. 

How do I fix this at work?"
Do you think that companies will start asking questions in interviews about how an applicant used the coronavirus lockdown to work on their personal development?,"**Edit: there are too many comments for me to reply to them all, but thank you everyone! This has really put my mind at rest. It's also made me consider how I could use this to find out whether a company is a good employer or not. Stay stafe**

Hi all,

For context: I'm a final year university student who will hopefully be 'graduating' this summer. I'm also currently applying for jobs, which is obviously not ideal in this climate.

I'm not dealing very well mental health wise with the current lockdown. I've got a few final university assignments to do, which I'm struggling to get done, but other than that I don't feel at all able to do... almost anything else. I'm seeking help etc. (I'll save you all the long details!), but I'm barely fulfilling the basic functions of a human being at the moment, let alone learning new skills, taking online courses, or generally working on my personal or professional development.

I'm worried that, over the coming months/year(s) I'm going to be asked about how I used this period to improve myself and make myself a better candidate, and that I'm not really going to be able to say anything. I can say that I was working on my university work, and that I've done a little bit of aid volunteering (it's an ad hoc kind of thing), but I reckon that lots of people feel more able to use this time to do lots of impressive stuff. That's how it feels among my peer group, anyway. I was already less than confident about getting a job after I graduated, but it would really suck if this was another blow.

I know that many of you are currently seeking employment/might work in recruitment etc., so I was just wondering what your thoughts were. Let me know if this is the wrong sub!

Thanks :)

Disclaimer: I fully realise that people have *far* *far* bigger problems to face, and that I'm in a pretty fortunate position.

TL;DR: for mental health reasons, I haven't been able to work on my personal development during lockdown, and I'm worried that this will hold me back in future job interviews."
Finding a job during the coronoavirus outbreak?," 

I'm curious as to what career opportunities that are available during the coronavirus pandemic that allow one to work from home? I'm afraid my opportunities are limited to only having a highschool diploma/cosmetology license, however I know there are people with more extensive qualifications, so all options are accepted under this post!

Thank you for any recommendations!"
Is it possible to find a job/career I would like if I hated all my previous ones? What I if I’m the problem,"Hi everyone,
For the past 7 years I was unhappy in every single job I had. They were all office jobs in similar fields but very different types of employers (small consulting, large international corporation, educational institution). I tried learning new skills like coding or taking classes in other fields, but I did not enjoy them. I like reading on different topics, but mostly browsing without getting deeply in any topic. I easily get bored and constantly distracted. I am relatively smart and capable, but I often procrastinate because I hate my job and just don’t want to do anything.
I am wondering, is it even possible to find enjoyable work? Or am I the problem?"
Update: got a job offer but failed drug test due to marijuana in NorCal . Is this end of the road?,"So some suggested I just go and tell the truth. I told them that I had make a mistake and smoked and that I didn’t have any disability to get the doctor recommendation for prescription. I had a doctors Rec couple of years before but not currently and that I didn’t need to be high all the time to function and work. They said since it is a national company they were ok if I were able to get the rec. I do have some medical issues but I didn’t get any rec for it because I had quit smoking. They said as long as the recommendations was given for ADA defined issues then it would be ok. So I went ahead and got a doctors recommendation today for some health issues. Therefore I would be able to get this job now. Was stressed out as I’ve been unemployed for a while but looks like light at the end of the road 

Edit: thank you to all for support and suggestions. I can see why Reddit is so powerful now "
"28 with a Master's degree but zero ""real"" job experience -- any advice for where I can finally get my feet wet?","After I got my Master's in International Studies, my first and last job was...making falafel at a falafel restaurant. Worked there for 5 months, quit, got married, dad died, fell into a 4 year depression, and while it took me a damn long time I'm finally healthy again and ready to find some fulfillment in pursuing a career!

So with that preface, I know I will be severely limited in my options because of my lacking resume. I've considered ""embellishing"" my resume because I have done some minor things to help with my uncle's business over the past four years. But I'm not sure how far I should go with that and it probably depends on where I end up applying.

Besides the resume issue (which concerns me the most), I'm also just not sure of what industry I want to get into. Some things I'm interested in are the travel industry, mental health care, human rights and social justice advocacy (sort of my focus in grad school), art, music, politics and international relations. But I'm also open to much more than that.

Lastly, I'm wondering if it would make any sense to get some more education before applying for jobs. Or would this be silly? The thing is, money is not a big problem for me (thanks to my wonderful wife) and I wouldn't really mind waiting another 1-2 years if it were in a field I'm passionate about. But I don't know if future employers would scoff at 3 degrees with no job experience save for helping my uncle's business once in a blue moon :P

Thanks for reading. I would be so grateful to hear any advice at all, even if it's just a few words!

Edit: Wow! I've never been on this sub before but you all are incredible! I'm going to try to respond to everyone when I have time tonight but for now, thank you for everything. I've already gotten dozens of suggestions I've never even considered before and it's so encouraging! Getting excited about my future again and it feels great."
"Hardly anyone speaks to me at work and I’m having difficulty connecting with my team. What am I doing wrong? Does anyone have suggestions on how to interact with coworkers, especially when you’re one of the youngest in the company?","EDIT: I just want to sincerely thank everyone for their comments and advice. It’s been super helpful and insightful—it’s so easy to get bogged down by my own personal feelings and not consider the perspective of others. I have a lot to consider: how to balance my true self and my work self, proving I’m a good worker, and thinking about if I am a fit long term in this current position or with the company.  I may not get to all your answers and advice but just know it’s appreciated!

—————
I just started a new job a couple of months ago and I’m having a hard time fitting in. It’s my first job out of school in a large company in the Midwest (USA) and I moved here from a North Carolina suburb. I am one of the youngest here. 

I’m a very outgoing person and was very excited to come to this position. I love learning about new people as well. I met with all kinds of people, introduced myself, asked them tons of questions, and tried my best to start conversations. 

But that’s not reciprocated. I often don’t get told good morning (I get no one OWES me this but it’s a bummer), I get ignored in meetings, and no one wants to hold a conversation with me about even the most mundane things. My emails get ignored sometimes too even by those within my function. For the email thing, I probably need to earn my place or something, but it’s compounded by all the other things I’ve been experiencing. 

A couple of examples:

My function had a group call and I asked them what they’ve had for breakfast just to fill the pre-meeting silence and got nothing back. Another person came on and they were willing to talk to them about their mundane question. So I didn’t bother saying anything else and it has made me stop going into meetings too early. 

I went to a team building lunch and no one spoke to me despite me asking them questions about themselves and trying to connect on what they’re talking about. At a table of four, I sat with two other new people and one seasoned employee. One new person asked everyone but me what brought them to the company. I asked her but no one reciprocated. Things like that happened throughout the lunch. I just stopped talking.

It’s honestly made me withdraw into myself and kind of killed my desire to be outgoing. I feel very alone and that no one really wants me there or wants to get to know me. I just sit in these meetings, introduce myself and people say “hi” and nothing else. So I’ve kind of stopped trying.

I know it’s important to be strong and hold out, especially in new positions, but I thrive off of team work and some sort of camraderie. 

It’s probably hard to gauge just from a post on reddit but any suggestions on how I can connect with my team and business partners? What sort of things am I doing wrong? What can I do to improve? Maybe I’m just reading into it incorrectly. I don’t know. I honestly feel like maybe the Midwest isn’t for me..."
"Name a job that typically requires experience to get hired, but really any person with enough intelligence could do?","As an example I work in the Logistics industry. My job requires a bachelor's degree and 2 years experience in the field. I was hired with zero experience, zero knowledge of the industry, and an associate's degree. I was referred by a current employee who spoke to my experience in overall business knowledge, customer service, professionalism etc. I learned the entire job in three weeks and now I'm training people. I am generally a very fast learner and did the same thing in other industries. I find a lot of jobs are like this and I'm looking at entering a new industry once again. Wondering what some might be where there are requirements, but if they just met me they would see I have the talent and skills to learn and do the job.

Of course there are many jobs that require specific education, licensing, etc. I would refer to those as skilled professions (doctors/nurses, electrician, etc).

So the question is, what jobs typically have educational/experience requirements that you don't actually need to be good at the job after some training?"
Has anyone else had their imposter syndrome flair up after not losing a job during layoffs? How have you dealt with it?,"First off I just want to say I am very fortunate, and I am very grateful for still having a job. I don't want to give up because I was given this opportunity so I better make the most of it. Any advice on how to move onward and upward when you're feeling survivors guilt and imposterish, would be very helpful.

The company I work for was just cut exactly in half. In a small company that feels really personal and not to mention we're in a fairly small town where everyone knows everyone. 

I was fairly new, and although I recently was getting over my imposter syndrome for being new and young. It came back full force right after ""mourning"" the loss of co-workers that I admired and that I felt were very hard-working. 

My job hasn't changed much since I am the only person who was doing my particular jobs and I had already been covering for another employee who was often absent for the past year or so. In fact my job has been a lot slower since people were let go.

Because of this I am panicking a little because of the lack of immediate fires to put out. And knowing that other people have massive new fires I was trying to streamline some of our processes to make life easier for others, but I may have frustrated them more. 

I feel guilty for still having my job. I feel guilty for not having a bunch of new responsibilities (yet). I know I have been working hard to make this workplace better and have been pretty well appreciated by management, but I can't help but feel guilty about others who loved their jobs losing them. And I'm feeling unreasonably useless right now. I know better, but I can't help but feel it and I am struggling to power through.

TLDR: I have a job even though our company downsized by half. Im struggling to move forward because I feel guilty and like an imposter. 

Any advice is appreciated, no matter how blunt."
My boss clearly wants me to quit. What now?,"**TLDR:** I adore my job and coworkers, but it's becoming clear that my boss wants me to leave. Instead of firing me during company layoffs, she seems to want to bully me until I quit. There is no HR dept *and* there are no other teams I could transfer to that don't already report to my boss. Is finding another job my only option here?

\----

I've worked for my employer for 4 years and received 1 raise during that time. The job is low-stress and I adore my coworkers, so I stayed. Last year, I tried salary negotiations, which were denied, but the CEO said he wanted to start grooming me for a Director role. I truly enjoyed the company culture, environment, coworkers, and the work that I do, so I stayed on board. However, that promotion never came.

Things went south in March. The company laid off 1/3 of their staff, then turned around and hired a new executive from Silicon Valley two weeks later, which seemed like odd timing. I managed to survive the mass layoffs, but I honestly wish they'd just let me go at that time. Ever since, my direct manager has been increasingly micromanaging me, and it seems she's looking for any excuse at all to fire me. She's giving my projects to others then replacing it with busy work, looking at my personal Google calendar on a daily basis (*not* because she's trying to schedule meetings with me either), and writing emails throwing me under the bus to the CEO. She also requires me to have multiple 1:1 meetings with her per day about the same exact project, and in between meetings she will sometimes send passive-aggressive emails. My favorite one was: ""Hey, are you in the office today or did you take unapproved PTO?"" (I'd already had two meetings *with her* that day, so she knew I was in the office, and I've *never* taken unapproved PTO.)

I'm trying to upward manage my boss and remain professional as much as possible, but it's becoming clear that she's setting me up to fail. During meetings, I've asked her for feedback and asked for specific reasons why she's dissatisfied with my work, but she swears that's not the case... then returns to her passive-aggressive behaviors. I'm so sad because I loved being a part of this company & have great rapport with my colleagues, but I might have to kiss this job goodbye due to this one toxic manager."
Is it okay to give up on my dreams......?,"And do something just for the money? Saw a career counselor at a local community college yesterday. She asked me why I wanted to be in med lab tech and I immediately said for the money. She tried to encourage me to find something I’m passionate about. But I’m only passionate about artistic things. I like games as artistic expression. I like cinematography. I’m not creative or talented though. And you can’t go to film school. That’s irresponsible right? 100k in debt and a useless degree. 

So is it okay to just do something for the money?

Edit: I’ve been at work so haven’t been able to reply or even read all of the things people have said to me. (I’ve been trying to find the time to add this for the last 3 hours.) Thanks everyone for giving me so much feedback. I unfortunately am working a 10 hour shift and will not be able to read anything or reply until much later in the day. I will be DMing some of you. Thank you."
Can an 30 year old unskilled loser still scrape together a decent career?,"I’m (30F) with no career but would love a decent job with people around my age that pays well or is respectable.

The only thing is I’m a loser and don’t have many skills or qualifications. I did a classical history degree I got the lowest possible grade - a Third (I’m in the UK, I was suffering with mental health issues at the time). I blew my chance at a good degree and  unfortunately a second degree is not an option as I can’t get funding for it a second one.

I work as admin in a hospital (low pay, dead end job)  and I’m surrounded by achievers who are doctors and nurses and I want to better myself.

I’m not good at maths /complicated topics and I struggle with talking to people. I was thinking about doing an online degree in illustration or graphic design as they cost about a third of on campus degree. I’m not sure if it would work or if I would get a good job out of it.

I love to draw, design and write but I only came across drawing in my mid twenties and I’m self taught and although I’m not very good I do enjoy it.

I’m not sure what options I have left as I don’t know what courses, roles I can do without the relevant degree or experience. Any advice would be greatly appreciated:)

Edit: Thank you everyone so much for all your suggestions. I’ll try and use all this advice. :)"

Tips for getting around being a nervous wreck during interviews?,"In the past 6 months I have screwed up two interviews to potential dream jobs. The story is always the same - I get past the screening stage but when it gets to the interview I panic if I get asked a question I’m unprepared for. I think it comes down to anxiety and my inability to really “think on my feet” during a high stress interview situation.

What can I potentially do to get better at this? I’ve read improv classes are great to learn to “think on your feet - can someone vouch for this?

Edit: I practice like crazy before my interviews! Im an anxious over-prepper! What catches me is if I get asked a question that I haven’t really prepared for - I.e. I’m struggling to think on my feet in those situations.

I lie awake at night thinking about having to work the next day. I am a grown 23 year old man and it makes me want to cry. 

This may sound ridiculous but I don’t know if this is an issue with the role or just a problem with me.

Like, at all. Never a “good job”, never anything insinuating they value me whatsoever. I don’t get any negative feedback either - just nothing. 

I’m the only person in the entire company who works alone (not on a team), so I want to stay connected to my boss. She routinely blows off our weekly meeting without reason and never reaches back out to apologize, let alone reschedule. Lately, she doesn’t even answer my emails. It makes me feel...stupid? Like my work isn’t that important to her. I honestly think I’m being forgotten about. 

I don’t hate my job, but being in a busy work environment and feeling isolated really sucks. I want to stick it out for at least 2 years, but I’m concerned this is going to stunt my career growth as I’m not learning anything from anyone, other than my own research."
Do you get imposter syndrome when starting/applying to a new job? How do you deal with it?,.
Am I going to bartend until I'm dead?,"There isn't a job I want to do. If I didn't have to work I wouldn't. I have never gotten any satisfaction from working, I have simply done it to keep a roof over my head.  I think this is how I fell into bartending in the first place.

I moved across the country at 20 years old (2008 by the way) and realized ""Life is hard when you're the one paying for it""  
Ended up in a bartending job because it was a way to make enough money to pay my bills and have some money left over for the actual enjoyable part of life.

Fast forward 11 years (31 now) and I'm still bartending. Where I'm working pays really well but I swear I'm dying on the inside. 

The problem is that I genuinely don't know how else to make a living out here. I live in CA and I can not reasonably afford to rent a place of my own (51% of my income just to cover the $1700 rent for a studio or maybe 1 bedroom if you're lucky) *with* my good paying bar job, so what else is there?

Am I missing something? Nothing really calls to me for a job, so is this it? Do I just bartend so that I have something to make an income off of for the rest of my life and just kinda die inside? There's no job that's calling to me. Hobbies and passions sure, but they require money to do anyway and you don't get paid to do them. Not as inexperienced as I am either.

I feel like I’m failing at my first job out of school. How do I know if it’s imposter syndrome or I’m just legitimately bad at my job?,"I graduated about a year ago and have been in my current full time job at a marketing agency for about 7 months. I had multiple internships before this job, but this is my first full-time role.

I pretty consistently feel anxious about how my coworkers are perceiving my performance. I often feel like I’m slow to catch on with specific tasks (ex. Navigating the platform used to set up digital display ads) and have to ask multiple questions. Whenever I ask my manager or coworkers a question, I feel like I’m annoying and bothering them.

I struggle with anxiety in general, but I also feel like I have a good sense of self-awareness and genuinely feel like I’m not doing my best. That being said, I had a 3 month review and it went well. I haven’t really brought up my concerns except to sometimes over apologize or thank my coworkers for their patience with me.

How do I get over this anxiety or increase my performance? I feel like I’m trying so hard, but to still be making stupid mistakes makes me feel awful."

What do people do to make over 200k a year?,"So i’m in school now (in Finland) and my grades are pretty good and i have motivation. My problem is that i don’t know what job i’d want to pursue in the future.

I have always been told just to go to school and get good grades but I’ve seen that it doesn’t always get you rich or happy. Law school and medical school would be ways there i guess, but they don’t interest me too much.

I got offered a new job which means I’m going to have to resign from my current role while in isolation. How should I approach this?,"Before we went into isolation, I was interviewing for another role and had my last interview around about the same time most businesses converted to working from home. 

They then called me to say that there’s a recruitment freeze and it would probably be a while before I’d hear back from them. 

I was relieved about this as my current employer has been really good to me throughout this whole isolation process and I didn’t want to have to resign during this time.

I received a call today to say that I basically had the position (pending reference checks) as the CEO of their company called off the recruitment freeze. 

I’m super happy about this as it’s exactly what I wanted before isolation began - the role is way more pay, in an industry im passionate about and close to home - but now I’m in an awkward position where I’m probably going to have to resign via email or zoom from my current employer. 

I’m having a lot of anxiety about resigning due to the fact my current employer has treated me really well, they’ve ensured my job security throughout lockdown and also it’s a ‘cushy’ job. 

But I also really want this other position and I won’t be able to wait it out until the end of lockdown to take it as I doubt it would still be available.

What is the best way for me to approach this? 

Ahhhh help 😢"
is it worth leaving a new job because of really poor leadership?,"Hi! I want to keep this as short as possible. 

I started a new job mid April. Everything was going great for the first month until another employee Karen* came back from covid lockdown. She didn’t like the way I did things and began berating me in front of everyone. I told my boss it made me uncomfortable and he said he would talk to her, but he totally folded, which reinforced her shitty behavior. Knowing he couldn’t help me I just tried to keep my mouth shut and ignore it.

She continued making me uncomfortable (yelling at me when things were wrong but also not training me to do it the “right way” beforehand) and I think another coworker noticed. He told my boss’ boss (the owner) I was overwhelmed and getting no help from Karen*. 

The owner to me in his office to talk. He asked what was going on and I said “I do not feel supported by Karen” to which he said “you are not supported by her.” Um, ok???? Wow love to work on a team that doesn’t support you. He went on to say “look we all hate Karen. She does this to everyone and several people have left bc of her. She causes drama and she does her work wrong half the time. But her bark is worse than her bite, it’s just a social learning curve you have to get used to. Just ignore her.” Um, no???? I work directly next to this woman that shits on everything I do and this is the best you can offer? She is directly ahead of me in the work flow how am I supposed to ignore or avoid her. He then tells me, “you’ll learn I have a fear of firing people. I hired Beth* bc she said she was bitchy enough to put Karen in her place, but now they’re buddies. So I’m hoping you can own that work area and run her out of here.” What the fuck??? Lol 

There are a lot of other hairy details I’m leaving out for the sake of hoping someone will read this. They warned me in the interview there would be drama. Red flag!! I feel like I’m being gaslit at this new job and I just want to quit. Before this I was working as a receptionist (earning only a dollar less than doing skilled labor) and they would take me back in a heartbeat. I’m leaving work every day stressed as hell, stomach in knots, and no energy to better myself or find a new job to get out of this situation. Reddit, What do I do?? 

TL;DR my boss knows Karen is problem, won’t do anything about it, and instead offloads the emotional labor of actually managing employees ONTO his employees, causing hellfire every day. Do I leave the company?"

24 with no work experience and completely lost in life. What should I do?," Hello all, I know this probably gets asked a lot but I felt like I really needed to get some advice. Lately I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks at night while I think about the future. I graduated from university exactly 2 years ago, and I have been unemployed and lost ever since. In college I was initially a business major with plans to specialize in sports business (sports are by far my biggest passion). After taking and struggling with the required classes such as Accounting, I did not meet the requirements to make it into the business school. With my business degree chances evaporated I changed majors and graduated with a more generic economics/business/sociology type degree with a minor in media studies.

As graduation approached I still had no answer to the classic question of “so what are you going to do next?”. I still love sports business but that field seems incredibly cutthroat and unstable. As an introverted guy I would really not fit in with that style of super social and outgoing personality to have success in that field. At this point in my life I feel just completely overwhelmed. The thought of a 9-5 job that I don’t enjoy makes me sick to my stomach just imagining it. My resume is barren and the more time that goes by the worse it will be. I have been studying for an IT certification but have made little progress. It makes me incredibly disappointed in myself that I can’t even get myself to study anymore. After 2 years of doing nothing I feel like I have snuffed out any flame of ambition I once had. I dread holidays and get anxious thinking about how I’m going to answer when family and strangers ask me “what do you do?”.

I know this is more of a rant but I felt like I needed to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone here has battled through a similar period in their life.

My main passions are sports, film, animals/environmental justice, poker (I love game theory and statistics).

Thank you!


Edit: Thank you all so much for your advice and wisdom. I kinda just expected to get a couple comments. I will read through all of your comments and I am trying to respond to all of you. If I don’t reply, don’t take it that I don’t appreciate your comment. You all rock!"
Online job hunting - what’s up with all the forms?,"I’m job hunting for the first time in over 10 years. 

Why does every company have such a LENGTHY online application process?!?! I don’t mind a short questionnaire, but I’m really tired of rewriting all of the exact same work history, skills, and contact info that are ALREADY RIGHT THERE ON MY CV. 

Maybe I need to do more networking so I can just send my CV straight to the right person. 

Any other job hunting tips are appreciated!"
Why does office culture like to drink so much?,"I can't possibly fathom why. But every culture of office I worked for, loves to drink. And generally it seems after a long hard work day or week, people go to the bars, or drink, or buy alcohol. Popular mainstream has also conditioned us to drink. But what is it about drinking that people like? It burns, it tastes awful, and it's expensive. Why would you do any of those combinations solo, let alone combined. Where is the correlation of a long hard work day and a beer involved?"
"Furloughed over a month ago, now employer posted an ad for the position I was about to take. Should I reach out?","So I used to work in the accounting department, then got a great job offer elsewhere, gave my notice, but employer lured me into getting a nice promotion to the finance department and stay. I stayed. I didn’t do well, hated my job, felt miserable. Beginning of 2020 I spoke to my boss about my dissatisfaction and asked him for my old job in accounting back. He agreed and seemed understanding but I had to stay with finance until a big project I was involved with was done (beginning April). I was happy!

Then pandemic happened... all that big project (the yearly budget) became void and I got furloughed. They were apologetic and I have since filed for unemployment and I’m home waiting to get a call back (and living my best life tbh). However, a good friend who’s a coworker in that accounting department gave his notice two weeks ago, and suggested me reach out to them to try and get back to the accounting department (remember, the CFO back in January promised me). I didn’t and now I found out that the company posted a google ad and on their website that they’re hiring for such position in accounting ON THE DAY MY COWORKER GAVE HIS NOTICE!!!! KILL ME!

I feel pretty hurt that they didn’t consider me back - kinda feels like they just wanted to get rid of me, and found an excuse. I excelled at my accounting job, and looks like the other ppl who got furloughed were all notably incompetent ppl. 

I need advice... should I reach out to the cfo who promised me the job and ask what’s up? Or should I let it go and wait/start looking for another job? 

TL;DR: furloughed, now they’re hiring for my position; should I reach out and ask them what’s up?"
Am I crazy to quit a job with a good title to go to something 'lesser' because of stress?,"I've been working as a pension fund administrator for the last 15 months now. Without too many details, ah this has been a very painful experience for me.I've been on contract this entire time, meaning I've had no vacation time sick days health insurance and my pay is very low I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck

However, my job title is quite impressive in the context of my career development over the last decade.

But I simply can't take this anymore. The stress is taking over my life, I've been having nightmares recently about my work. I'm not able to save any money at all... This job is good for my career but bad for my life.

I know I need to find new employment, but to find something that would take advantage of this experience would probably take a while. And I don't have a while, I can't wait anymore I feel like I'm on the edge of something bad if I keep trying to put up with my current situation.

My question is, would I be crazy to quit and take a job that doesn't take advantage of this recent experience? 

To be specific, I know I can get a job working as a front desk attendant at a hotel. It would be much less stressful, I would be full-time so I would have a decent pay, health insurance, vacation time, etc.

But would this derail my career? If I did want to come back to the pensions industry with this sort of be a black mark for me? should I just suck it up and try to deal with my current situation for the next few months until I can find a role that would be in a related industry and that at least would be a lateral move??

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks everyone"

Does anyone else get caught up in what other people see you doing and lose sight of where you see yourself?,"Sorry for the long title, but is it just me?? I'm considered a very caring person and so my friend and family are always saying how I should be a nurse or a counselor. And yes, those are great careers-- but, I know that I'd probably get burnout pretty fast, as I sometimes burden myself with the struggles of others. But knowing this (and myself), I still feel like I need to fulfill a role like that to meet my full potential and since I don't think I will, I feel like a failure. Does anyone else deal with this? Any tips on how to separate yourself from these expectations?"
"35yo with weird life trajectory trying to get a 9-5 job for the first time. Feeling kinda hopeless, got any advice for me?","I started freelance editing/proofreading about 10 years ago and stuck with it until now due to various family/health issues that prevented me from taking up a 9-5 job. I have 2 incomplete degrees that I abandoned years ago because I didn't need them for freelancing (MA about 90% completed, BA about 50%). 

Now I need a way to support myself and I'm trying to finally set up something that will work for me in the long run. My freelancer profile is probably my best asset with a 100% client satisfaction score and some great written feedback. I never knew it would be so useless when trying to find employment. 

The thing is, I want to quit freelancing. For me, it's always been too much effort for an unbalanced work life and little money. I definitely never enjoyed the constant race for new clients either. Some of this is probably my fault.

I also want to step away from editing. I'm a decent editor, but not some great talent, and I no longer enjoy doing it. This is partly because of the nature of freelancing and partly because I find most of my projects unfulfilling and meaningless. I did have some good, long-term clients, but not enough to be able to refuse crappy ones.

My aim is to establish a simple, ""normal"" adult life with a job that pays the bills and has fixed work hours. At this point, I don't even care if it's boring, I just want to be financially balanced, not having to work (chase new clients) to be able to work, and have a couple of hours to myself after I've finished work.

But I'm not sure it's possible to make this transition without solid work experience and education on my resume. I'm worried that I'm too old, my work experience is not enough, and generally not sure how to go about it. 

Do you have any advice for me? Courses I should take that would make me marketable in a short period of time?

I'm actually not some lowlife, I just need someone to give me a break. I work hard, learn fast, and I'm responsible. I've always worked remotely and would like to keep it that way. I was looking at jobs like content moderation and customer support roles where they don't necessarily ask for relevant experience. But there might be other options, I just really never learned how to do a proper job search. Any advice is appreciated!

Sorry about the long-ass post, and thank you for taking the time to read it :)

What made you finally quit your job?,"Every single morning I wake up and hit the snooze button three times. I get to work early but walk in late. I have to take the city bus and it's awful. I hate being in the city because of the filth and stench. I hate feeling like a lab rat in a cage with others doing literally the same thing every day. I come home crying. I have no energy to do anything after work. It might sound obvious that it's time to quit, but I need the paycheck. I've been applying to other jobs since January with no luck. There's been several days I've cried in the bathroom and almost quit on the spot. I know I probably need therapy but I don't feel right about it for the fact I don't want to have to get help to live a certain way of life I don't want. I'm sorry for this rant.

Is it possible to make good money outside of an office job?,"I make decent money climbing up corporate ladder type jobs and I am wondering is it even possible to start over and make decent money outside of an office setting?

"If your 30+, did you change career in your young 30s and how did it go?","A little bit about me...

I’m 32 and had a stroke November last year, which took away my speech. I had to relearn how to speak starting with the abc. Today marks five months since my stoke and I have recovered roughly 75%. I still find it difficult to get out some complex words, joining words (like ‘and’ and ‘an’), and my sentences sometimes have slight gaps between words. Sometimes I speak perfectly, but I’m slower than I once was but I’m getting there! They say it’s takes several months to a year to heal the brain after a stoke. I’m have youth on my side. 

Before I had my stroke, I was travelling the world for six months. I got made redundant in March 2019 from my finance role, where I analysed companies (shares) and the economy for a living for six years writing a newsletter for a global publishing company. All up I have roughly 7-8 year experience in the financial industry. But I wasn’t able to break into a big fund or broking firm, so I was severely underpaid (~$80k) by industry standards of $150k+. But I have the interesting and competitive experience for finance, I guess.

My concern is that I have over a years gap on my CV....now with the corona virus and businesses not advertising for jobs. Then again, if this event didn’t happen, I still wouldn’t feel ready because of my speech - it will be hard to sell myself now. I’m thinking of giving myself until the end of the year to hopefully recover, and, by then hopefully the economy will be reopened and companies hiring again. 

To cut a long story short, I’ll probably be out of the work force for nearly 2 years because of my stroke and the economic shutdown before I apply to jobs...if I start applying at the start of next year. 

I have always wanted to give tech sales a crack, but that depends obviously on my speech and how much it recovers - I’ll need to sell myself to land a job and I can only do that if I’m 99% better. I feel hopeful about it though. But I don’t know what I will look like in 3-6 months. If not, I will probably go back into finance becuase I’ll have no choice. That said, I’m just concerned about my possible 2 year gap. 

Do you think I’m screwed and have anyone changed careers in their 30s, or got a professional job with a long gap on their CV?"

"Can you please suggest something to learn during the quarantine, so that it will help me get a job later?"," Hello everyone!  
I just found this channel. I hope you're all doing fine.  
It was a long time ago since I posted something here.  
I graduated BA in English and Communications, but I really didn't like my major and was forced by my family to study there. I am in this big messy situation, I really love drawing. For the past 4-5 years, I have been drawing and I really had improved my skill. However, I can't find a job in my country (Armenia). So some of my relatives and my family members keep pushing me to find new interests and search jobs in different categories. I would like you to suggest some areas (such as programming, software testing, etc). My friends suggested me UI/UX design, web programming, and others. I just can't find any interest, so I beg you, please suggest me something.

Thank you in advance!  
P.S. Don't lose your hopes! We will beat through the virus!"
How do I get another job if I am blacklisted?,"Sorry this is going to be a fairly long post.

After graduating from college I wasn’t getting anywhere due to lack of experience.  I somehow lucked into my current job at an early stage startup where I got given a chance. My boss (CEO) seemed nice and friendly, and first few weeks seemed fine enough that I thought this could be a place I could grow into. We had lunches together and talked about the kind of work to be done and expectations of support I will need.

But then suddenly, my boss’s attitude changed and he started swearing a lot and becoming abusive. I think this coincided with the CTO resigning. So because we became short staffed, my boss started throwing work at me which I was completely unqualified for. He also casually blackmails me saying “he’ll destroy my career if I don’t deliver on my work” or “ruin my life in ways I haven’t even thought of”. After I barely manage to scrape through a deliverable, he suddenly becomes friendly again. 

For my next deliverable, I’ve already been sent work to do over the weekend and honestly I am completely out of my depth... I would normally do as I am told, but the fact is, I am too slow. I am just a novice programmer and I’m expected to produce the work of someone with 10 experience with no support.

I’ve started to get nightmares and woke up this morning in a pretty terrible state. 

I don’t really know what to do next because it’s obvious my boss will blacklist me in this industry if I try and get another job...

TLDR: Lucked into a software dev job. Expected to deliver at the level of someone with 10 years experience. Could get blacklisted if I try to leave or don’t deliver on my work. How do I find a way around this?"
How do I tell my job I don't want to meet clients due to covid-19?,"Basically I am insurance adjuster. I am low level so I do all the field work such as canvasses and interviews. I have been authorized to do most of my interviews over the phone already however, I have a 3 year old daughter and live with my parents who are 56 and not in great health. Me going to knock on doors and meet random strangers around a large metro area seems irresponsible at this point. 

They only company response we have had is that we can expense sanitization products. I am very fortunate to work remotely for the most part and be paid. Second due to the virus they can't really replace me or get mad because it's not great hiring time. Lastly I am getting blow back from my whole family about going out. How do I frame this to my employer. They are understanding and nice, but I haven't pushed back yet and am basically I am a mindless yes man and produce tons of work because I just treat it like the army and do whatever I am told."
I don’t want a STEM degree. Are there any decent degrees that aren’t STEM degrees?,"I feel like every time I ask for advice or search for advice on reddit, the top comments are usually filled with advice advice such as “pair this shitty degree with statistics or computer science” or “your lawyer job is going to be obsolete due to automation”. 

I can’t take it anymore. It’s killing me. Most of us don’t want a STEM degree just so we can a decent job. “LOL! Just code”.

Why is there such a huge circlejerk when it comes to STEM jobs? Honestly, I’m just sick of getting advice from reddit.

You guys are this generation’s Wall Street yuppies. You bring out these soulless statistics to prove your point. Not considering if people actually like these degrees. “Do the degree you enjoy the most, not the degree that makes you a fuckton of money. Unless it’s a shitty degree like economics and polisci and not a comp sci degree”."
I have made a huge mistake and switched to a new company mid-pandemic. I hate it. What should I do?,"A few months ago I was contacted by a head hunter for a job with a much higher salary in a very prominente company, better benefits and lots of flexibility.  
At this point, I was employed for 2,5 years in a fairly good company, which had its problems, but I could deal with them. They didn't pay very well, though, but I had lots of flexibility, a great team and super interesting projects.  
At the same time I was contacted by this head hunter, I was going through the selection process to my dream job and I had made it until the last phase where it was just me or another person.    
So, I had 2 very good opportunities on the table: my dream job and the other job which was better. I decided it was safe to quit.  
As you may imagine, I was not selected for my dream job. So I was left with a very good job offer, which was ok for me. I took it and here I am, 2 months later.  
My mistake was that I was so convinced I was going to get the dream job that I didn't pay attention to the signs in my interactions with my current employer that this was bad, nor did I dedicate any effort to get to know a bit more of the company.   
This new company is absolutely the worst. They literally lied in the interviews about the company’s working culture, their stance about flexibility and even about some aspects of my contract.  
I got in the company in the middle of a HUGE crisis where I immediately took a ton of responsibility and I felt it would not be correct for my colleagues if I quit during my experience period and leave them with all of this by themselves. 2 of them are really great, one of them actually quit last week. The company has a huge turnover, as you can imagine.  
I am finding out more and more horrific things about this company every day. My boss is a hypocrite, liar, has no empathy, treats women poorly, and everything revolves around him and how brilliant he is. Overall a sick narcissist. Last year alone, 2 people had burnouts and 1 had a stroke after working 4 days without sleeping.  
I worked 2 national holidays and 1 full weekend, plus a million extra hours for an event, which I would not do in a normal situation, but everything was very badly managed and if I didn’t, nothing would work. The day after the event I was told we could take one day off (which is not enough either way), so I took it, but apparently it just meant that instead of arriving at 9:30 I could arrive at 10:00. And this is not even a joke or me exaggerating.  
I’m not going to rant anymore, but many other very horrible things have happened and I honestly don’t know what to do. There should be an economic crisis coming up and I’m not sure I can just quit without anything lined-up. I don’t want to be unemployed when it hits. I have applied to 3 jobs so far that I’m waiting for an answer. 1 of them with people I know and who really appreciate my job, another one for a position that I’m 100% qualified, and another one that actually I will not take at all even if I’m selected because it is not very interesting. In addition, I have a volunteer project writing articles in my area for a think tank and I would like to take a programming bootcamp.  
I was absolutely naïve and I didn’t even make an effort to try to research about them, I know this is my fault. I never thought this was ever a possible scenario. But I just feel that coming here every day is doing a number on my mental health. I absolutely HATE being here and I’m actually scared that they can screw up my career if I stay longer. I’ve heard stories.  
Should I just quit? Should I suck it up and train my resilience skills?   
  
Edit: format"
Any advice for a 22 year old who still doesn’t know what they want to be when they grow up?,"The title was obviously a joke, well, not really. I’m 22 and I’m currently finishing my Bachelor in Business Information Technology. I hate it. I’m thinking about studying a postgraduate degree that will help me change this career before I even started it. The only reason I continued in this career is because of my family and their pressure, dumb move, I know. Anyway I don’t even know what I want to switch into, but this whole business thing feels so superficial, and not me. I like helping people, providing people with the chance to change their lives, guiding troubled people, especially youth. I want to make a difference in this world. I consider myself to be a very smart person, I did extremely well in school, in every subject. I did IB and I was good at math, at chemistry, at biology, at English, history. I’m good at language and research, I learn quickly. I’m creative, I love art and design and that was my passion for a while until I was crushed by the reality of that industry having no money. I’m an INFP if that helps? I’m bilingual, I’m interested in culture and travel and politics and social justice. I don’t know if any of this is even relevant but if anyone has any ideas, any guidance, on a field I can pursue that I may have not considered, please please please just comment it. I’ve considered social work, psychology, law. I’m afraid of the job prospectives of those things, I don’t want to be broke and unemployed. Throughout my university life I’ve worked in data entry, social media marketing and retail just to make some money and get some experience. I did well at them but I just didn’t feel happy working so hard just to increase the profit of a company who didn’t care about anyone. I’m so lost and I just hope that someone has some advice to offer. Anyone who’s been through a similar experience. I’m not asking for anyone to solve all my life issues and lay out a plan, I’m just looking for some insight. So please, spare me the condescending comments, I’ve already heard too many of them on this website. If anyone has some advice to offer I’d really appreciate it, I’m even willing to pay for their services."
How far would you let a job mentally break you before you quit?,I've been looking for something else since January and haven't had a single phone call back. I cannot mentally take being in my current job any longer. It's taking way too long to get something else. I still live at home so money isn't a big deal but I still pay my part. How far would you let a job mentally break you before you quit?
How do I find what I love to do to make a career out of?,"It may seem like a stupid question but I’m genuinely lost. I feel like I have the motivation and burning desire to work towards a career doing something I love, but I can’t figure out what the career should be. Also, I have no problem taking a lower paying job if it’s doing something I love. 

The only hobbies I had as a kid were playing soccer and Motorsport (karting) but it’s too late to make a career out of that as I’m 20 years old now. My current hobbies are exercise, reading, and video games, but I wouldn’t say I love any of them enough to make a career out of. 

I’m studying Electrical Engineering in university right now because science and tech has always been an interest, but again, I can’t say I love it or am passionate about it. 

I feel like every day that passes I’m losing out because I’m not working towards something I’m proud or passionate about. I know I’m still young and have lots of time to figure life out, but I feel lost and uncertain.

Any advice would be appreciated."
How can I make my boss understand how overworked I am?,"Basically, I'm the team lead and in charge of supervising two junior team members, so I have all of their responsibilities plus a heap of other responsibilities on top of them - including managing those team members. Despite this, I've been repeatedly chewed out by my boss because the junior team members complete more of a few specific kind of tasks than I do in a shift.

To me this seems ridiculous. It's like asking a manager of a coffee shop why they aren't making as many cups of coffee as the baristas. During shifts I'm the sole go-to person for people from other departments (there's a lot of back and forth) and in charge of overseeing operations, and deciding which tasks are priorities and which aren't, and doing final QC checks. Even to get all of that done I usually end up working 10-12 hour days, and it's still not enough.

My boss just won't listen when I explain how overworked I am. He has very specific ideas about how long certain tasks ""should"" take, right down to the second. He's mapped out my shifts according to these increments of time that he's decided constitute how long each task should take and it all adds up to 8 hours, therefore he thinks there shouldn't be a problem. There's no accounting for the fact that switching tasks every few minutes makes a dent in focus and productivity.

For example, one of the tasks that he's tacked onto my job is running social media. I'm supposed to post to Twitter 30 times a day with accompanying images, gifs etc. and he says that this should be easy because ""it only takes a few seconds."" But crafting a tweet that's witty and engaging and corporate-friendly takes more than just a few seconds, and interrupting my day to do it 30 times is really disruptive.

With everything that I'm expected to do, mistakes are inevitably made and things slip through the cracks. I've been reprimanded for mistakes many times and every single time I tell him the same thing: I have too much stuff to do. And nothing changes. If anything, more work just gets added to the list.

Has anyone had any success getting through to a hard-headed boss? So far I've tried everything that I can think of."
"How do I say ""I want a chill job"" without using those words?","Due to health reasons and a desire to survive while I transition to a  more creative career in music and writing, I want to take an easier day job. I work in marketing and it's pretty brutal. The work itself is not difficult, but I've yet to meet a CEO or director who isn't flying by the seat of their pants, that actually has a mission, yearly goals, and vision of what things we do and, more importantly, what we *don't*  do. Every day there's a new fire. This is beyond crisis communication -  that's different, I don't do that. This is like, ""we need a campaign on  XYZ in three days including radio, tv, print, billboards, social media,  etc etc etc,"" which they will then forget about the next week and that campaign just fizzles and dies. Meanwhile, the actual steady work we have been doing gets pushed back and is in danger of not meeting hard-as-steel deadlines.

AnYwAy, I  want to work a job where I'm not asked to create Michelangelo's David  in three days, where the biggest emergency is that we need to run an errand during office hours. I'm thinking administrative support type jobs. However, I'm overqualified in that I've had loads of responsibility and the work I do is very big and splashy.

My initial thought is to highlight what I bring to the table (project managing, creativity, desktop publishing) rather than my own desires.  However, most places will ask ""why do you want this job?"" or ""why do you want to work for us?""

How do I tell, say, a university department or contract law firm that I want a more chill job *without saying* I want a more chill job? 

(or if you know of a chill job using the same skills, lmk!)"
How can I navigate my education in a society that deems so many degrees to be worthless?,"I’m trying to find what path to go in college and of course everything Im passionate about “doesn’t get you a job.” Im unsure on what I should pursue. I am passionate in many areas. I really have wanted to go into psychology these past few years and I think I would do well in a psych career. I just really love research it’s just the issue with that is, it seems like a very soulless cut throat environment. My other passions are advocacy and politics. Another subject I love is sociology I really enjoyed learning about how things work together. If anyone knows which one of these would be best to pursue as a major and has any examples of paths I could take towards decent paying jobs please let me know. I want to learn about things other than psych I’ve already researched all of those for the most part. I just want to help and empower people ultimately whether large or small scale."
"As a Young Professor, How Should I Deal With Disrespect From Older Professors?","I'm a professor in my twenties. I get confused for being a student despite dressing like a professional. For whatever reason, it seems like that allows older professors to speak disrespectfully to me in front of my students, whom I expect respect from. When they see co-workers disrespecting me, how are they supposed to have any respect for me? Twice in a row I've had other professors barge in my class and tell me to turn down the volume of the video clip we're watching because it was distracting their class next door. Yet both times, they refused to close their classroom doors and always blasted the volume to their videos so loud our classroom could hear it very clearly while I was instructing. My students remarked at the hypocrisy of the instructor to make such a request. 

Today I had an older professor come into my classroom that she normally uses and exclaim, ""Who are YOU?"" in front of my students during class. She was upset that I happened to be using a classroom that is ""hers"" yet college classrooms are like free real estate. They aren't designated to any one person. This is also the second time another professor has addressed me like that in front of my students. Her tone was irritated and upset, and I found that to be highly inappropriate. 

I honestly don't know how to address these issues. I'm very cordial and put on a smile and gladly answer, pretending as if I'm not miffed at all. But I don't feel I should be treated this way. What can I say to enforce my authority as a co-worker and prevent them from being rude to me in front of my students? Or should I just keep brushing it off?"
"Uk based 30-year-old embarrassed and ashamed of my art degree, I want to try and make something of myself but unsure what that is, looking for some help?",I got an art degree a couple of years ago. God knows what I was thinking ! for years I have been struggling with guilt over it watching all the other grads with tech and finance go onto great well-paid careers that see them well in the future. Well I have been in lockdown struggling on little money I have and finally decided enough is enough I want to change my life and make something of myself but I am unsure of what to do. I am looking for advice from people who were in similar positions and made a break out into something with a good salary and future prospects.
I am a 23 year old software engineer and I'm not happy in my job. Advice for alternate career paths?,"I like coding, but I'm finding that doing it for 8-10 hours a day 5 days a week is making me miserable. I also think a big factor in my unhappiness is that I am indoors all the time and don't interact with other people much. I often have no motivation to work and have very unproductive days. It is only very recently that I've considered that this job might not be the best fit for me, but I'm kind of at a loss when it comes to considering other options. Some random ideas that have come up in the last month: becoming a locksmith or working on a farm or just anything that gets me out in the world instead of sitting at a desk all day. I get out on the weekends and before and after work every day for exercise, but I still find it's not enough. I have an AA degree and this software job is the first real job I've ever had, which started in October 2018. Anyone have advice for figuring out what I want to do?

Edit: I am in south Florida"
"Bosses: What are the differences between your best employees and ""the rest""?","I'm a young professional, about 3 years out of college and work in communications. I've learned that there's a lot more to the ""best vs. the rest"" categories than performing your duties well. What are those soft/technical skills that silo off the best from the rest?"
Why do recruiters think it's acceptable to be so aggressive?," I recently made my resume visible again on a popular job search site. Almost instantaneously, I was inundated with calls, emails, and even texts from recruiters. Some would use all three methods, one right after the other. In addition, a large percentage of these recruiters would call my phone not once, but twice in a row, and some of them even called THREE times in a row. When I’d send them to voicemail, they’d just call right back a second later.

This kind of behavior is ridiculous. There is no better way to drive candidates away than to inundate them like this. In addition, I'm getting multiple recruiters contacting me for the exact same job - I'm talking upwards of 10 different recruiting companies trying to fill the same position. I can't imagine that a company would enlist 10 separate recruiting companies to fill one position, that just doesn't add up to me."
How do you succeed in business as a shy/introverted person?,"So far the biggest thing holding me back in business is being shy. I can typically turn on the charm when I have to, like for a client or for an interview. But I’m more of a quiet reserved person. 

It doesn’t necessarily hold me back professionally, such as I still make and exceed my sales goals, I am very quick to learn new skills, I am patient and calm with clients and can turn around a bad situation by being nice and “sweet”

But it does hold me back in the social aspect of my business life. Some example of this are I have trouble networking and making connections. I don’t make friends easily at the office (6 months in I’m loved by everyone, but up until then I get a lot of heat. They don’t understand why the quiet girl is doing so well and the loud people are just doing ok). I once had a boss call a meeting with me just tell me the thing she hated about me most was that I was shy. I asked her if she thought I wasn’t doing my work well, she said it was all great but she didn’t like that I wasn’t loud and chatty like her. I could understand if a client said something, but I didn’t work with clients at that point, I did research for her. 

I learn by listening and observing, then trying and then asking questions along the way. I’ve had employers tell me that if I’m not asking questions while learning, I’m not paying attention. So then I end up thinking of questions I don’t really need to ask just to appease them by asking *something* and they point this out as a negative also. 

I don’t know how to succeed in business as a shy person in a field that is run and dominated by extroverted people. All answered are greatly appreciated!"
My dad just lost his job again - how can I support him?,"My dad is a highly capable man who has worked in the finance field for around 15 years. He's lost his job before and it was a stressful time for him and our family.

 I doubt I'll be able to actually help him find a job but I just want to know if you have any suggestions for how I can support him. For context, I am 17."
Is it normal to not receive a raise after 10 years when your salary is the industry average?,"My mother is an RN in the private sector as a home nurse. She started with the company in 2010 at $30 an hour. It's been 10 years and they never offered her a raise. Not once. Nothing. She recently asked for a raise and they offered her a measly dollar. The problem is wages in the private sector are right around $25-$30 an hour for my state. She's definitely in the top 20% of salary earners but it's pretty demoralizing knowing you're making less money than you were 10 years ago when you adjust for inflation.

How do companies go about handling raises for tenured employees? After all if they can get a young RN and pay them $25 an hour why would they want to pay my aging mother anything more than $30? Is this a problem with the company or just the economy in general? I feel like going 10 years without even a small raise to compensate for inflation is just god awful for a company to do to an employee.

Should she try to find another job or just stay put? Obviously wages have to get raised eventually. She shouldn't be making $30 in 2010 and then $31 in 2020 and $32 in 2030. Somethings got to give, right?"
My work expects me to literally sit and do nothing most of the day. How do I handle this?,"I work in a machine shop doing CNC grinding (essentially computer controlled machines that grind metal parts to bring them to certain sizes), and up until now, the night shift I work on has been allowed to read or use our phones while the machines are running. Well, they've decided to change that recently. They have decided that they are going to watch the cameras to make sure we aren't doing anything non work related while the machines run. 

My complaint is that the machines I run have anywhere from 30 mins to 4 hours to complete one part; usually it's about one hour. I work a 10 hour shift. There is literally nothing work related I can do in that time; cleaning takes 15 mins and doesn't need to be done every night. I've already read the books we have about the machines and the grinding processes about 15 times over when I first got hired. The machines don't need any human interference while they're running, but we do have to be near them so we know when they're done. 

The argument from the higher ups is that we're getting paid to work and not anything else. The conclusion I've come to is they're expecting us to sit there literally doing nothing while the machines run. I don't know about anyone else, but I cannot sit around doing absolutely nothing for an average of an hour at a time; it is mind numbing and essentially virtually impossible (I also have ADHD on top of this). How do I handle this going forward? I want to be a good employee and not get fired, but I also don't want to be treated like a robot since that isn't what any of the employees are."
Would you rather take a long commute for a super desirable job or take a satisfactory job within walking distance?,"So I recently finished a round of interviews with two that I’m feeling really confident about. I’ve confirmed a tertiary interview with one, and was promised a decision by the end of this week from the other.

The tertiary interview I’m heading for next week is my dream job at this point in my career. I’d be managing an entire department consisting of multiple teams — it’s a big jump from the quasi-managerial roles I’ve had previously, the office environment is amazing, they’re in a big growth mode — everything about it is extremely exciting. But I don’t have a car and public transportation in my area is lacking, so it’s a bitch to get to considering it’s out in the suburbs.

The other I’m hoping for an offer from is a quick, free city bus ride away, or I could even walk there if I really wanted to... but it’s more of a lateral move, the company is in a niche industry and not expanding much, but the office is still a very cool environment, so I feel like I’d be happy there.

So, I’m curious what this sub has to say — would you rather take a really good job that’s a bitch to get to, or wipe out the commute for something less enticing?

EDIT: After reading the responses, I’m realizing I’d rather take the commute for the career jump. Commutes don’t bother me, work is life at this stage, and I’ll kick myself if I turn it down for a job I’m a lot less excited about just because I didn’t want to travel as far. Thank you all for your input, and let’s hope I get that offer to start off the new year!"
"I have applied to 80 jobs on Linkedin, and have gotten ZERO responses. What am I doing wrong?","Hello,

As seen in the title my job search has been off the chain as of recent. I currently work a 645 to 415 job where I make 35k and work 50+ hours a week. It is soul-draining and I can not do this much longer.

I am currently paying my minimum on my loans among numerous other expenses, I am in no position to just quit until I am able to find a new career.

I graduated a year ago ( Dec '19) from an above-average business program, with a degree in logistics and supply chain. I was quite active, through my fraternity and the supply chain club. My grades were good (3.4) and I am was also able to graduate a year early due to workload and credits from HS.

I look great on paper, I am even better IRL. Not too gloat but I am currently among the top 5 trainees in my current company ( 500+) in sales, but I just have no interest in working there and would leave at the drop of a hat.

However, my job search is horrid, like worse than Season 8 of GOT. I have only been applying to supply chain/logistics field positions. For the most part its been assistants or entry-level positions, and a few higher-level positions for giggles. But its been three weeks now and I have not gotten a single reply, not even a rejection letter.

I have already submitted my resume to r/Resume for help and even used a website to generate a resume.

What I am asking is should I continue busting my chops at my current company or should I leave and work a part-time position and focus solely on finding a better career?

Also if anyone has been in this position, I could really use some advice as I am freshly turned 22 years old just trying to enjoy my early twenties while also being able to pay off some of this ever-increasing debt...

&#x200B;

Thanks !!

Update:

Today I accepted a job offer for a large manufacturing company as an associate product manager! I wanted to thank everyone who helped throughout, either with wise words or motivational comments, its because of this subreddit I found the will to keep grinding and hustling. Now I am about to start my path to success and hope to someday be able to turn around and help someone like me, its not lost my friend, its just waiting!"
Is anyone else completely averse to brown-nosing?,"I literally can’t brown-nose. It’s against my entire being to do it. I deal with people for who they are, and if I like you then I like you...and if I don’t, then I don’t. I’m not going to suck up to anyone who I don’t respect, regardless of title. I stand my ground and speak the truth and adhere to what I know is the right thing to do. 

This has obviously caused some clashes in the corporate world, because I simply won’t play the game. But honestly, I don’t care. 

Anyone else like this?"
Has anyone lost all drive in their career (and life) due to a highly mundane job? Did you get it back once moving on?,"My current job is very dull and inefficient, with simple tasks taking all day due to outdated processes. I have tried to address this but the bureaucracy makes this near impossible.

I've found this is really getting to me and I've just lost interest in attempting anything and am now doubting my own abilities. Worryingly this seems to be bleeding into my own hobbies and goals.

Has anyone else been in this scenario? Did changing jobs help?"
Am I wrong to want a job with decent vacation?,"I'm in the USA and we're known for our lack of vacation time. However, at my old job I had 2 weeks of paid vacation, and next summer I would have been entitled for 3 weeks paid. I had been with them for 4 years and got an extra week for each year I was there.

But my new job is only 2 days of vacation for a whole year, which is awful. I enjoy traveling and 2 days does not fit my needs. Am I wrong for wanting a job to give me a proper vacation in my first year? I don't agree with having to ""earn"" it, I think that's silly. I've worked long enough and it sucks you start all over again when you begin a new job.

I am looking for another job even though I've only been at this one for 2 months. It's a lot more serious things than vacation pushing me away though. It's just one more thing added to the pile of negatives. I wouldn't have left my old job if it wasn't for a nasty colleague who was never disciplined."
Is Corona virus affecting the job market? & Any excel learning advice?,"I’ve been having trouble getting employed. I haven’t received an interview interview since early February and I’m starting to think that employers are going to start being precautious and many will put a hold on hiring.

What are your thoughts?

If this does happen, what should I do meanwhile?

Also: does anyone have any tips/videos recommendations to be proficient at Excel?"
How long did you spend at a job you hate?,"Long story short, I’ve been with my current company for coming up 2 years. My first job out of college and it’s a great job, pays well, great benefits etc. But there’s one huge problem which is I absolutely hate it and have felt this way for months. I desperately want a change and I’d like to do entirely different work from what I’m doing now. Problem is it’s been hard to find something I ACTUALLY want to do so I’m not in this same position after a year, so anybody ever been through something similar as this? How did you go about navigating through this time?"
How do I get an entry-level job with a seemingly irrelevant degree and no real experience?,"I graduated almost three years ago with a BS in Physics and went on to do a year and a half of grad school before deciding against the full 6-year commitment. During my time at grad school I had been getting paid only a bare minimum, and since I had really no savings I had to find income right away and ended up serving/bar-tending for the past year, but I am really trying to start my career.  

I’ve applied to over 400 jobs in the past month, but it seems like a physics degree will always be overshadowed by an engineering or computer science degree when it comes to STEM jobs, and my only real professional experience is a cumulative 4 years working in research labs (mostly in optics). I’d like to think I have basic programming/engineering skills and I’m really not picky about the field I go into at this point, the pay, or the position.

I’m wondering if anyone has any tips as to what I did or am doing wrong, and what type of jobs I should be applying for. Is there any way for me to advance my career without going back to school for a more desirable degree?"
Coworker blaming me for suicide attempt - How do I proceed?,"Me: 28
Fiancé: 32
Psycho bitch: mid-late 30s

Recently my boyfriend/FI popped the question after a year together! We work at the same company but he’s in a different office an hour away. 

About a week after that I got a work email at 3AM from some bitch (PB) in his office. Claimed they’d been dating for 5 years, he’s the father of her 9 y/o daughter, how could I sleep at night destroying a family, I don’t need a husband when I have a good job, and if I could get a white man why did I need to “take a good Black man.” She threatened to go to my supervisor that I was “fraternizing at work”. 

I emailed her back, “Don’t ever contact me again; and do your career a favor and keep made-up personal drama off your work server.” 

Both FI & several friends at his office confirmed FI’s story - he took her out once 5 years ago for workday lunch while PB was going through a divorce.  (I knew this before we got together) Also a friend sent me some screenshots of FB - PB and her daughter are the whitest people ever. Turns out the little girl’s dad knows my parents and is a good guy.  

In other words PB built a lot up in her mind & people have been working to make her understand it’s not true; they were never in a relationship. 

I went to PB’s supervisor; she got written up & had to attend sensitivity training or something. 

My supervisor wasn’t delighted that I was dating someone at the company, especially since FI and I (and 150-some others) roll up to the same VP. He said that going to the supervisor was unnecessary and that I needed to “hide (my) disdain for single moms better.”  He was unable to provide specifics. 

I just learned that the other night PB went on some bender and sent out a bunch of unhinged messages to coworkers about me ruining her and her daughters life before attempting suicide (in front of the girl). I’m horrified she got to that point, but also furious she brought my name into it. 

It sounds like she’ll be Ok physically (girl is with her dad) but I’m meeting with Hr tomorrow. Should I expect to have a job when that meeting is over?"
"When you're unemployed, what are you supposed to do with all your free time?","When you're unemployed, what are you supposed to do with all your free time?

I just recently became unemployed. I filed for unemployment, so I'm waiting for them to approve or deny my request. But I still just can't shake it.

Prior to that, I had a 40-hour work week. Now that I'm not in that world anymore, am I just supposed to sit in front of a computer, and apply to jobs 24/7. It just seems mundane, and I don't know what to do.

I still have to wait for them to get back to me, but why is finding a job, such a job in of itself. 

I've been applying for the eight last hours, woke up at 5 AM, and I'm feeling super discouraged.

How important is it to you that your job aligns with your values?,"The older I get, the more I realize just how important it is to me that my job aligns with my values. Feeling good about the work I'm doing and the purpose behind it has become vital to me. When I was younger, I didn't see it that way because all I was focused on was making money and getting a better title. But now I see that there is so much more to it than that.

Are you currently in a job that aligns with your personal, core values? If not, would you switch careers in order to do something that would be more meaningful and fulfilling for you?"
My problem is I keep taking jobs that don’t take me any where. How do I pick a career where I can really grow & not be stagnant from false promises?,"Where to start...I have a degree in graphic design and have been doing this for about 9ish years. I’m currently getting my degree in Marketing and slowly have been getting into that industry for the past 4 years. My track record has shown that I keep accepting job offers that promise opportunities that never seem to come to fruition. 

When I first decided to switch to marketing (bc I couldn’t find any decent paying jobs in graphic design in my area) I took a job in marketing at a small (but had a huge client list across the country) business that promise I would be working & gaining experience in marketing. They wanted someone fresh because they never really had a designated marketing person and it would be a great growing experience for both of us. They were the ones who got me back in school for marketing. I stayed there a little over 3 years and ended up only really ever doing graphic design with minimal raises, barely any marketing experience, and no promotions. I eventually left that company when they opened a new position in marketing & never considered me for the position (even though this would have been GREAT marketing experience for me and i expressed interest in the position) to give it to someone outside the company that eventually came out she had no idea what she was doing. 

I had another dumb job that didn’t even last a year and now I’m at my current job. Once again, during the hiring process promised me that they wanted someone with my background because they wanted to start actively branding the company and wanted to really start marketing their charitable events. Well, surprise surprise, 2 years later I only KIND OF started to dip my toe into marketing. But the small amount of projects I’ve tried to get started have just been shut down or nothing ever comes of it. So long story short I did work for absolutely no reason. I’m ready to leave this job now too but I need some guidance on how to pick better job opportunities that won’t leave me stagnant or just doing graphic design for low pay. HELP!"
"My first year sales goal was 200k, and I’ve reached 1.1 million in 9 months, how do I communicate this with my boss and/or use it to my advantage while exploring more established companies to apply to?","I’m 25 years old and work in high end landscape design and construction (patios, outdoor kitchens, walls, etc.). My role for the first year has consisted of Project Manager, Designer, and Foreman actually working in the field on a couple of projects due to staff constraints. Before I joined, the company’s revenue was around 500-600k. This year, the company revenue will total 800-850k. We couldn’t produce any more work than that because there aren’t enough skilled employees, and frankly the existing employees are pretty awful (lazy, bare minimum, can’t wait to be laid off, etc.).

The company owner tried for over a year to hire a designer/manager to take over for him as he wants to move toward retirement, and I don’t think he expected me to basically take over the entirety of design/sales and crew management in the first year. My potential is limited by the size of the company and lack of skilled and motivated staff. I am confident that I could sell over 2 million in projects per year for a company that can handle that volume of work. 

I was hired in at 65k per year based on the first year sales of 200k (owner saw the first year as a transition phase for him getting out of design/sales so he took a small pay cut). I’ve sold 1.1 million, but the company literally can’t produce that amount of work in a single year, so how do I go about a hefty salary negotiation since I’m basically driving the whole damn ship for the owner? There are other companies 1-2 hours away from my current city hiring design/sales positions with salaries and great benefit packages well over 100-120k, which I feel I could absolutely achieve. 

I’m not sure what the best move is for me career wise. I don’t want to insult my current boss and ask for a massive pay increase, but I do need to explore and consider what’s best for myself and my family. I also want to feel fulfilled at work and not limited. Advice please!"

What are some jobs where slowness is a virtue?,"I’m slow. Not stupid, I’ve been tested, I don’t have any cognitive impairment or learning disability they know how to test, I am simply not fast.

In every job and school I’ve been in, that’s the only complaint I’ve ever gotten but which I always, always get: I am not fast enough, I don’t do quickly enough, I am not time-efficient enough.

"27 and never had a job, just sold my business, how to transition to career?","I've been running my small online business since I got out of highschool.

Learned a bunch of stuff along the way and was able to scale my digital services business to over $1.2m/yr in revenue. I am now selling the business for a very healthy sum, around $4M so I won't really have to worry about money too much.

I just want to invest that money and let it sit while I find some new work. I would love to work in online advertising or ecommerce, as these are 2 things I feel I know the most about.

I've gotten a resume professionally made and applied to a bunch of jobs in random pay ranges for these fields. $50k/yr SEO jobs to $200k/yr VP of eCommerce jobs.

I don't really get any replies. I don't have a degree or any job experience so it is hard to get interviews.

Online advertising/eCommerce are performance based industries, you either make money or lose money. Fairly binary. I have a 7+ year track record of 6 figure profits purely from my digital marketing acumen with the analytics to prove it.

How to quit a job without telling the truth?,"So I've just been offered a job today in a different company and I am really scared of telling my manager/CEO the truth of why I will be leaving.

So our company is quite small - growing moderately - and without sounding big headed, I have helped the company grow a lot. I know they really need me and my skills as a designer, however my manager takes most of the credit of my work, therefore he is getting promoted more than me (I also get the fact he is the manager) and instead I have received a small salary increase instead.

Anyways, the manager treats me like crap most of the time, our boss can also be horrible and demands the best quality of work with the shortest amount of time possible (so working OT/working over weekends) and if you don't deliver, you're just not good enough for their company. My manager has honestly been horrible to me, even the staff in different departments commented on how he speaks to me.

My notice period is a month, and I know for a fact he's going to be so horrible when I tell him I will be moving to a different company (sort of a competitor too), and I'm just not willing to sit through for a month of hell. He's currently been nice because one of our ex assistant had left a horrible glassdoor review of working for the company.

What should I do? Should I lie that I'm leaving the city to go back home? I know he will be constantly asking and prying for the rest of my notice period so I can't exactly say 'I can't tell you/I don't need to tell you'.

Help/advice will be appreciated!

What should I do with my life?,"Hi I'm 28yo Canadian and have worked in the film industry since high school starting as a production assistant and moving up. My job has been my whole life. The money is good but I work soooo much. I work an extreme amount - 80 hours a week. Sometimes I have weeks with no work and sometimes I work 10 months in a row non-stop. 

My mental health is suffering now that I'm older -- I can't sustain this lifestyle, I want different things, some free time and money doesn't matter as much. I would be happy 40-50k a year. My personality type is INTP if that helps.

I want to...

work in an office setting, good job prospects, courses that are less than 1 year and cost less than 10k to complete.

I have no bachelors degree or any skills outside of my industry. I am very hard-working and feel like I'm capable of a lot. I don't even have any interests outside my industry that would be applicable to other careers... :( 

Do not want to go into healthcare or trades. 

Options I am thinking of:

PCP (payroll certificate in Canada) -Has anyone done this? Getting a job doing payroll --again don't know if I can get hired without having an HR or Accounting designation. 

Programming -- Don't know where to start here, I am thinking of learning a language (Python) or going to a coding bootcamp oe doing a udemy course. 

Feel overwhelmed with the choices and don't know if learning programming languages but having no formal computer science education will let me get a job. 

Please suggest me anything!"
"Job that I was a runner-up for 8 months ago and was told ""we would be interested in talking again in 6 months"" has advertised a new job that's an even better fit to my skill set.

Does it makes sense to get a job just to pay the bills while still educating for something that you truly want to do as a job in the future?,"I got a job offer from a government institution in Justice. It's not what i want but it could keep me going and i would perhaps be able to move out from my parents. 

But i would really like to work in IT, but might not have the skillset for it yet. Shall i get more experience first or try right away in the industry? 

I am 25, have a degree in economics and some online data science courses knowledge, but also a year of work epxerience in communications and 1 year of volunteering.

"My mother has been looking for a job since 2016 with no luck, does anyone have advice?","I'm a 15 year old who my mom has raised on her own since I was 2. She is a terrific, hard worker. She has been looking for a job since 2016 with no luck. She graduated from a good college, and has a master's degree in Human Resources. She applies for SEVERAL jobs all day every day, and even with the occasional rare interview, nothing ever pans out. I hate seeing her so stressed and she deserves SO MUCH more than what she is getting. Since she doesn't have a job, we don't have enough money for our own apartment and therefore live with my grandparents which puts a strain on both of our mental healths(?). She is determined, great at motivating herself, is very flexible, never complains, and is overall just a REALLY hard worker. She doesn't stop until her task is done. I really wish there was some way I could help her, but I can't. Does anyone here know what to do? She has updated her resume and practiced interviewing many times. She just really needs a good job! 

TDLR; my mother (a terrific, hard worker who has raised me on her own since I was 2) has been looking for a job since 2016 with no luck. She has a master's degree in human resources. Help please.

How did you guys find your career?,I'm almost 30 years old and I still don't have a career. Sure I have a lot of work experience but ive never really truly been able to find my career. I only stayed at jobs for 1-2 year's before moving on. I've got a BA in Public administration and criminal justice and been out of school for 3 years. The current job I'm at now has a lot of room for growth but it's not something I want to make a career out of. I'm just not sure how I'd be able to find my career. How do you know what you're doing now is what you want to do for the rest of your life?
Any careers that earn 60k or more with 1 year or less of higher education?,"I’m a college grad (bs in chemistry and pharmd) currently practicing as a pharmacist. With layoffs around the country I’m considering a new career as the pharmacist market is over saturated. I’m open to new careers but unsure where to even start looking. Ideally I’d like to work prn as a pharmacist (much easier to find than full time) while obtaining a degree/certification/etc for my new career, but with my student loans from pharmacy I don’t think I could comfortably make less than 60k/year. My pharmacist salary was 140k but I will never have that again even if I continue to work as a pharmacist. 

So far it seems if I want to continue my education with my chemistry degree I will have to retake a lot of classes since I graduated 10 years ago. I have also never worked with my chemistry degree but feel like I would enjoy analytical or lab type work. I’ve also considered pursuing a pharmaceutical sales job or learning to be an esthetician or a real estate agent, but unsure what their salaries would realistically be (Tampa area).

Any advice on what careers to specifically research?"
Is it in poor taste to quit a job I just started to accept a better offer?,"I accepted a job last week, and tomorrow will be my first day. Another company I have been interviewing with contacted me today to complete a background check, and on their online portal it says ""offered"". I don't have an official offer, but I believe one is contingent on my background check. It is higher pay, better benefits, and more aligned with my career goals. 

I would just quit my first offer, but I am worried the background check won't go through. I am mostly concerned because my last job was an unpaid volunteer internship. HR at my previous internship won't be able to verify my ""employment"". Only me previous manager. Do you think this will make me fail the background check? HireRight didn't have me fill in any employment information, but I imagine they are getting that information from my resume or job application. 

So currently my plan is to go to my first day tomorrow, and continue working the first job until I potentially get an offer from the second place. I'm hoping it will be a week or less. Or, should I just call and tell them I decided to accept another offer? I feel bad wasting their time, but I'm worried I won't really get an offer from the better company. 

I really need advice."
"have you ever been let go because you were not liked, not due to job performance?", I don't imagine this happens often but it did to me a few years back and it is still something I ruminate over.
How realistic is a career in programming from being self-taught?,"Live in UK.

- Early 20s.
- Have no qualifications.
- Left education at 16 to work for family business but want to move on.
- Never been smart, no special talents or anything.

And I want to teach myself code. Am I kidding myself?

I do have an interest but have no experience. I have a whole year off work to get started.

Please be brutally honest.
Very much considering joining the army if all falls apart so there's that.

Edit: Genuinely staggered by all these replies, thank you! Heaps of information, so glad I asked this here.

Going to get straight to it then. Success or not, might as well give it my best shot. Cheers!"

Which companies did not retract job offers due to covid-19?,"A few days ago I received the news that my job offer for a business dev position from a fairly large IT firm (\~$4B annual revenue, >10K employees) had been retracted.

does anyone know which companies have not retracted their job offers and/or what positions?

TYSM! -- would been great to know, now that like many others I'm back on the search in a terrible job market

How do you stay positive while on the job hunt?,"It's been 2 months since I've been laid off, currently working at Starbucks (and getting physically and mentally exhausted), in a online masters program, and flat broke. I've been getting interviews and received many compliments from the places I've interviewed at. But I've heard nothing back. Not even from recruiters I was working with. 

I'm still applying like crazy, and doing my best to avoid a scam, but I'm tired. I'm so disappointed by the results so far and I feel like giving up. It's really difficult to stay positive. Im  pushing 30 and I don't have a career. Last year, I've barely made $20k. I'm embarrassed at myself. I've made a promise to myself to never have that as your total amount again.

Those who have been on the job hunt, how did you do it? How have you stay positive? Any answers is welcomed. Thanks

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the responses. Overwhelmed by the support."
Did anyone hate your new job after 3 months in?,"Probation period is 6 months but 3 months into the job and im hating it. It gives me jitters, i was judged of my performance simply because im too quiet. I was told im not doing much to empower my colleagues. And i realise the job wasnt what i thought to be. It worsens my anxiety and i had to work long hours. What do i tell my prospective employers if i were to go for interviews again?

update: thanks people, i didnt know that my post would attract so much attention. thank u for all the suggestions and encouragement i really appreciate it. has anyone of u tried to look for jobs base on your personality and character and scrutinise the jobscope and role and thinking that u would be suitable for the job u r applying?"
Why does it seem like so many people are trying to get out of IT fields?,"Lay it on me, I want to know because I’ve been kicking myself since freshman year (senior now) of my bachelors for not going into computer science, cyber security, or IT.  

I’ve been trying to think of every possible way to get a Masters in one of those fields instead, but then I see a LOT of people posting on here trying to get out of the field.

Why is that? What am I missing? It seems like a constantly growing and hiring field with lots of potential for working in different sectors."
How do you not compare yourself to others?,"I was just viewing LinkedIn. Catching up on some old friends, and I just started a new job. Figured I should update my status to reflect my current situation in life 

It was better then my old one. But then I noticed my friends from university, whom I talked to, were a lot higher in tier and status then I am. Some were managers, others were senior associates, some stated their own company. I'm still entry level. 

Just made me feel bad. I'm not sure what to do."
"Very tempted to quit my job without a new job lined up, am I justified in my reasoning or is it all in my head?"," I'm 23F content writer and I've been in this company for 10 months ish. At first, I really liked this job because my team in digital marketing was really great and fun and I got to learn a lot. But one problem is that our management (CEO, VPS etc) are super disorganized. Like has no clear vision of what they want, gives super vague instructions and indecisive on the output, gives us tasks without any working materials or assets and gets mad when the results aren't skyrocketing. The DM team itself is also fairly new (around a year).

Before, I could bear it cus I liked our team lead and the process but since the pandemic hit, they've pretty much wave after wave of lay offs because we weren't showing results/cost cutting (we work with international students so that's important to know). I was spared because: 1. I was the only writer they had at the time for both operations and marketing, 2. the only one who didnt quit, 3. the only one who could work in a fast-paced environment.

Right now though, I'm starting to really hate it here. Management is still super disorganized and has no direction, the new marketing head doesnt communicate anything and just tells me to do this and that so I have no idea what the direction of our marketing is supposed to go, work hours are spilling over to my free time, and the new 'senior writer and communications specialist' they hired is super rude and mean. Like he just barks orders and tells me to do the stuff he was assigned to do (like simply telling the devs or designers to make this web page etc).

I was gonna suck it up until the end of the virus at least but something our new video editor said struck me. He said he wondered why they needed a new guy who doesnt know the brand of the company or know where to get the materials be the lead coordinator/project manager when the end result is that people turn to me to ask for those stuff anyway. And why they couldnt have just promoted me to senior and hired someone in my place. And like I dont wanna brag but I've been doing really good and have become familiar with all these things so I was thinking maybe he has a point.

So on top of feeling overworked, underpaid, and dissatisfied, I have to add underappreciated too haha. So I'm just tempted to quit now even without a new job lined up since my freelance clients rn can meet my salary anyway and I have enough emergency funds for like a year. Would it be a good idea to quit or am I just overwhelmed with stuff and the pandemic is making it worse?"
Has anyone noticed the pay rate go down?,"I been thinking about leaving my current company for some time. And started to research my position at different companies. Looking at requirements, pay, company reviews, growth opportunity. Every position was offering 60 to 80k for my position. I started to apply at places and received a job offer making 80k. This was early march, new job was supposed to start beginning of april. But because of covid-19, the position was instead eliminated. 

I took the month of April to stop the job search since there was a hiring freeze anyways, and resumed a few days ago. Now, I'm seeing reposts and new posts for the same position offering 25 to 40k!!! Even the position above mine was once 100 to 150k and now 40 to 60k range! 


Also, not necessarily part of this but kinda, I received a call for a position above me. Offering $12 and hour! I apologized but said I could not accept anything below $24 an hour. This is just my basic cost of living. Essential bills, gas, food, and $100 in savings a month, no extras. I couldn't believe it. I know the economy is suffering right now but my rent isn't getting lower.

EDIT:

To the lowlifes who read my entire history and then try to openly discredit anything I say, first of all this is reddit!!!! Do you really think I use my real name? Or do you really think I'm going to be 100% specific about my actual life? No. This is an anonymous reddit. I may change small things but purely so it cannot be traced back to me. I have NEVER been a receptionist. And have NEVER said that. I am a woman in construction and it is all too true that many times more assistant/admin worked has been given to me despite what I do. I have worked unbelievably hard to get where I am. Unfortunately what I do and what my industry is, it is all too easy to find me. So yes, I'm a little vague in what I write. It's no crime. It is purely for privacy and safety reasons. This post has been the most honest. The position and industry I am in  THAT I STATE IN THIS POST is 100% FACT!!!!! I will not say what area of the US I am in for those privacy reasons."
How do you overcome GPA gatekeeping?,"(Posting on behalf of my husband)

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech. We thought, ok he has some job experience, let’s try applying to low level jobs at the engineering firms. Maybe now the GPA won’t be an issue.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

Does this mean his GPA will always keep him from becoming a mechanical engineer? How do you get a foot in the door to even be interviewed if places don’t even look at your experience because of GPA? Should he be thinking of a new career path? 

Thank you in advance for any advice!"
What have you learned from losing a job?,"This is a hard topic, a heartbroken one with  unspeakable amount of selfdoubt and intense feeling of worthless. I know it's horrible, because I'm going through it now.  For the first time in my career of almost a decade, I don't have a job anymore. I knew my career was stall with this company, and I wasn't happy with it, but I didn't act on it to look for next job, until being let go. I was too attached to my job and I forgot the reality of corporate world. I was too distracted by other aspects in my life, that I didn't prioritize career development. So it is a wakeup call for me, painful one though. 


I'd rather put my regret in the perspective of learning from my experience, and if possible to hear you my Redditor friends' learning experience. 


Because I'd like to think (and know for fact) losing a job is not the end of life, there is still hope and a better future."
"I don't want to work for the corporate world, how do I fulfill this?","Sorry if this is jumbled and a lot to read.

I'm a 22 year old male from the USA about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering (Computer Science) in 2021. I had an internship and honestly it was the perfect job for someone going into my field, it was fun, exciting, and hands on.

I just don't feel any type of reward from working hourly paid jobs, maybe because I don't feel the direct impact of what I am doing, plus I hate belonging to a big group.

I noticed I am much more productive when I'm not following other peoples orders. For example, over the breaks I would sometimes do unassigned projects on my own, then when the next semester would start a professor would assign something similar and I would end up procrastinating and barely submit it on time while I had already completed something similar. I also work as a freelance mobile mechanic and do heavy research on the vehicles that I fix and I have a lot of enjoyment working on their cars.

In my life I had worked 12 different jobs (construction, software internships, mechanic engineering internships, Retail, etc.) and I would always think cynical thoughts to cripple the companies.

I'm currently deciding whether to just graduate and finish my degree in Software Engineering, then apply for dental school and eventually open my own practice.

My dream in life is to work less than half the year in the States, and spend the rest of the year in a Latin American country with the money I saved up working in the USA. Basically make 40k in 6 months then live in Central America for the other 6 and repeat this process.

edit: Latin American country for example would be a Guatemala or an Ecuador, something less developed, than some of the more booming markets."
Why is it so hard to find a job?,"I've just been down on my luck. I've been networking, fixing my resume, praying, and applying non-stop. Linkedin, job boards, I mean. I'm 25, nearing 26. I'm not well. Why is it so hard to find a job? I'm not doing good, you guys. I try to be positive and motivated, but it's hard. Rejection after rejection. What do I do?"
"Coworker is acting like my manager, am I taking things to personally?","Potentially in need of some constructive criticism, but I’ve been feeling managed by one of my coworkers as of late. I’m wondering if she’s really trying to be helpful or if she’s campaigning for a supervisor position. We are on the same team & have the same job title. Also worth noting, I have been doing this job for 3 years, she has been with the company for a couple years but is new to this role. She is also at least 30 years older than me.

Today she sent an email to myself, my manager, and a couple of other coworkers that I work closely with. It included a list of “best practices” when onboarding our clients and said she was excited to teach me how to do so. Again, this is a job I’ve been doing for 3 years and have never received a complaint about my quality of work. The kicker about this email is that she also felt the need to copy and paste our job description into it.  I spoke with a coworker that was also on the email to see if I had missed something and to find out why this email was even sent, and that coworker confirmed that I have not had any missteps in these areas so the email seems very out of the blue. 

There have also been a couple of instances where she checks in to make sure I’ve done things on my accounts that she is not involved in. Every time she asks these questions the answer is yes, I have done it, but she continues to go out of her way to make sure I’m doing my job.  It’s out of character for members of our team to check that other teammates are completing work properly, (whether that’s right or wrong for our organization I’m unsure) I can’t imagine ever doing this to another member of my team. It feels like she’s stepping on my toes but I don’t want to seem ungrateful if she truly is trying to help. 

Any advice on how to handle / constructive criticism if I’m taking things to personally are welcome!!"
What are hiring managers and hr really looking for on a LinkedIn profile that the can't find on a resume?,"Watched a video where the guy was saying it's used for discrimination and doesn't have any verification of employment. It's becoming required by more jobs in order to get more information on an candidate than they normally don't need so they can use it to discriminate (age, sexual orientation, race, job gaps etc.)

Is this what it's actually used for? I'd prefer from actual hiring managers and hr but i'm open to all opinions. I have never thought about it that way, I just have it to connect with people and keep a network open.

What was your “lucky break” that got you into a great career or a high paying position?,"As the title states. What did you do, or how did your “lucky break” come about in regards to your job?

How do you deal with becoming jaded?,"When I first entered into the workforce, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed 10 years ago, I had a very idealistic view of the corporate world. I trusted everyone and I thought everyone operated above-board, all the time. 

Now, 10 years in, I’ve simply seen too much and I’ve reached “jaded” status. I’ve seen good people get sabotaged and fired, I’ve witnessed and experienced sexual harassment, and I’ve watched the destruction of office politics take its toll. 

So, when people talk about things like “show company loyalty” or “align with your peers” or “trust your boss”, I just can’t take any of it seriously anymore. You can follow “the rules” in the workplace and still get screwed over. You can build rapport and still get sabotaged. You can do everything right on paper, and still get treated as nothing more than replaceable cog. 

If you’ve experienced this, how do you deal with it? How do you reconcile the fact that you really can’t trust anyone at work, and that so much of what you see on the surface is total BS?"
Is it OK to Stop Working Hard?,"Context: Worked for large company for a few years. Annual reviews one person in department gets big raise, and extra 2.5-5% on top of annual. 

Last year I busted my ass, working 80 hour weeks, 7 days, coming back at night to cover emergencies.

Other departments come to me when they need something done. I am a doer and was just doing my best to support the product at launch. 

Review time, no big bonus. I didn't talk to boss because it is already done and won't be changed, and I won't be satisfied with the answer. 

Instead I went full office space and began doing my basic requirements. 8 hours, 5 days. Other departments come for help, and I tell them to ask (Specific responsible person). 

I feel bad because I can do more, but I don't see the purpose of doing more. I can do the minimum and make the same salary, and be home with the family more. 

In the meantime I am looking for other opportunities, but for now I feel like a slacker for only doing my job. "

I’m doing a bad job because I suddenly got sick. I’m terrified it will ruin my career. How can I ask for help when I’ve only been in the job so briefly?,"I have an autoimmune hyperthyroid disorder that has greatly affected me the past two months. Medication is no longer working and I’m doing very poorly at work. 

Most days my heart rate is 105 -130. I’m confused a lot, anxious, and distracted. I cannot think critically, organize my thoughts, or do the analytics I need to be successful in this job, no matter how I try. I’m lucky my workload is light at this time due to the current COVID situation.  I hope to have surgery to remove my thyroid in June but in the mean time, I’m stuck like this

This job is high level and if I fuck it up, the industry is small and I’m not sure if my reputation would recover. I just started my job in January and had my disease go haywire in February. Quitting is not an option due to health insurance and a relocation repayment agreement of $20k.

At the interview, I presented as a smart and capable person. Now I feel I can barely think of words to say. I feel 100% incapable of making good recommendations and business decisions. It took me a full day to comprehend and complete a simple task. I have chest pains and unexplained anxiety daily. It’s serious and I feel my reputation is tarnished if I don’t get time to get better. 

I’m exploring my options for leave but I’m terrified of the repercussions. How can I speak to my boss? I’m terrified of being fired in the COVID-19 environment and being left without health insurance. It would potentially ruin my career as well. Should I speak to HR first?"
"This is one for the employers. I found out I have lowest salary in the whole company, and now I feel like an idiot. What should I do?","I will try to keep it short. I got hired over a year ago in a Hotels & Resorts company, for the IT position. The list of my duties and projects grew and still grows rapidly and I manage to keep up even though I work alone.

The employer seems really happy and surprised, since he wasn't even sure I could do the job. I had a degree in Information Technology and zero experience, at the time. We work very close and he is my only supervisor. He keeps throwing problems and stuff that need solving and fixing at me, and I have never said ""I can't do it, I don't know how.""

I am a pretty fast learner, you see, and given some time I can have at least basic knowledge on anything that comes my way. A Jack of all trades, I guess, but mostly technology trades.

 In the winter months we started using Filemaker (data base platform), and I developed 2 solutions. One of which manages the payroll of all the employees. As you can imagine I, now, know everything.

I work hard, harder than I've ever worked. My worst fear is disappointing him and that says it all.

It also happens I have the lowest salary of all. Even the waiters at the buffet restaurant. I was a waitress, I don't wish to insult any one, but they don't work from home on holidays. Or answer the phone any time it rings even on my day off.

I believe I deserve a raise for all I do. And I will ask for a big one , too. But I don't want him to think that knowing the salary of others had anything to do with it. I feel it would brake his trust.

How should I do it?"
"I'm 25 and lost for choice of career, can anyone help?","Im 25 years old, and I can't make my mind up about which career to follow.

Things started to go well, studied literature,art and cinema in high school, and got into art school. I wanted to be an artist ever since I can remember, but sadly the school I got into specialized in conceptual art while I planned to go into illustration. I made the most of it, but only half the students got through to second year and I didn't make the cut. 

They told me I should try another art school but I didn't get into one, so I studied English Literature for a couple of years, then my student loans got cut so I had to look for a job. It took a year of trials doing any job that would take me until I got an apprentiship as a salesman at a makeup and perfume shop. The apprentiship went well, and I took a second apprentiship as assistant manager straight afterwards. I thought it was a great opportunity to learn valuable skills.
When I left, I thought about becoming an accountant, but after some research I realised it wasn't for me.

Recently I got some experience working for a woman who designs bags and accessories, It went great, she said I had a lot of potential, and I'm currently applying for a course in upcycling clothes. But since the quarantine put everything on pause I'm starting to have doubts again.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I can draw, paint, farm, apply makeup, sell a brand or product, manage a shop, write, analyse, research, sew. I want to do it all but I can't commit to one. If anyone's got any advice I'd really appreciate it, because right now I feel lost."
Can anyone tell me a job where I wont have to deal with backstabbing co workers 8 hours a day?,"So i've had it. I am sick and tired of the information withholding, lies, slander, undermining, fake kindness by this toxic employee I work with in the office. She exerts herself as a boss because my actual boss is never present.

Is there anything wrong with having no career interests?,"Should I feel shame for having literally no interests?

Would Cyber security be a good major for someone who feels as if he has literally no interests?

I don't know whats going on, but I don't seem to feel emotionally strong about anything anymore. I can't think of a single career that sounds enjoyable. I can barely muster up the energy to do something as simple as watching a movie. I'm starting to realize that I've never had strong feelings over any sort of activity or hobby in my life. All I do is work and when I get home I just do nothing until I fall asleep. I just need a career that will provide me with money so that I can continue to sleep until I die. My current major is Computer Sciences (something I also have no feelings over). I just decided to take it for no reason, to be honest. I thought that it seemed normal enough that no one would ask me questions about it and find out that I have no interests. Someone recommended that I switch to Cyber security. Does that sound like a good idea? I’ve already put so much work into my current major that I would feel completely ashamed to admit that I have no interests."

In a normal lay off, I would find a new job in a few weeks. This is different.

Taking a Pay Cut for Coronavirus... Should I Do It?,"Update: thank you everyone for all of your sage advice! I’ve decided to take the cut and start working on my network and resume. I’m very grateful to even have a job during this time and need to remember that as I go forward! 

I make $52k a year in a big city and just barely get by as I help out my mom financially. Half of my small company was laid off in the past few weeks and now I've been asked to join the rest of the company in taking a 10% pay cut for an entire year (April 1, 2020 - April 1 2021). In return, they're giving me 5 extra vacation days, which hurts because how could I afford a vacation on less pay?

I've spoken with my friend in HR there and know for a fact that everyone else makes at least $20k more than she and I do, so asking the only 2 people who make less money to also take a cut makes me so angry. Granted, I'm extremely fortunate to have a job still in this climate. 

I've been told I can keep my current pay and forgo my extra vacation days but the people I've spoken to have said I shouldn't expect to keep my job if I do that. I'm terrified of losing my job but I can't imagine spending an entire year making so little money. Any advice on how you would handle this?"
What’s a good career quiz that can help discover what strong skill sets one may have and also help discover fields of interest?,I am looking to make a career change and can really use some inspiration while gaining insight on what skills I’ve honed over the first half of my career. I would also like to find something that may be a new interest or passion. Any help in finding a reliable source appreciated.
What is in your opinion the top skills you should have for the workplace?,"Regardless of degree....what are the top skills to possess. Like Microsoft office skills, soft skills, etc."
Graduating next year with a BS in Psychology at the age of 30 with a lowish GPA (3.1). What jobs do I qualify for to become an ACTUAL career?,"The title is self-explanatory; possibly a bit vague. I was hoping to go to grad school, but that seems hard with my GPA. I would like to work a job that I can find growth and not a glass ceiling. Stable income that can grow nicely with experience, as well as growth within the company or my title to carry to other organizations would be ideal. I was thinking I would qualify for HR or office manager jobs. Any advice is helpful! Thanks!"
"Do people in elite fields (investment banking, management consulting, big law etc) tend to be more cold-hearted compared to others ?","I've always noticed this elitist feel about them. Like to them they only care about results and anything else that gets in the way of results (apart from blatant illegal stuff) is a bother to them. 

People in this field usually attract a lot of Type A aggressive people that can make really hard decisions such as giving advice to close down a factory and laying off the employees etc."
"After more than a decade of trying I've come to the conclusion that IT/software is really not for me, and I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life. What are my options?"," I'm turning 30 in a few months and don't really have anything to show for it. Since I was about five years old I've been 'the computer guy' to my family and friends, and while I've had other interests along the way, most have been for fun and not necessarily something I could make a profit off of, or make into a lifestyle. I've been swapping parts and making upgrades since before I was allowed to use the stove. In the past I've been steered back into tech whenever I decide on a whim to do something differently, because according to my friends, my folks, my family, etc, ""you have an innate knowledge for how machines work, and you're very socially awkward, so tech is perfect for you"".

I went to college for Computer Science, and my professors told me I wasn't cut out for it. I figured, that's nonsense, I'm the computer guy, if I work hard enough and believe I can do it I can be a success story just like every other success story I've read about. Turns out the real world doesn't work that way, and I was transferred to the 'web and game design' major. They didn't want me in that department either but I managed to stick it out. I took a ton of unrelated electives to bring up my GPA enough to stay in school (I don't regret that because I got to take some very cool classes), and I eventually graduated with a very poor major GPA (and a great non-major GPA) and have worked a bunch of Geek Squad/Apple Store/helpdesk related jobs, and a smattering of retail/food service jobs as well.

I've done countless hours of research on how to become a software engineer or IT professional. If I had to guess I'd say somewhere around 12000-18000 hours. Researching bootcamps, languages, putting together websites, doing FreeCodeCamp, going to tech nights and hackathons, it's been a ride for sure. I signed up for HackReactor, Thinkful, AppAcademy, Operation Spark, they all told me I don't have the knack but I kept trying, figuring eventually it'd all click and at that point the pieces would just fall into place. A little while ago I decided I'd make one final effort to make this happen, I enrolled in college for my second Bachelors at a 'go at your own pace' college, this time in Computer Science, and somehow this time I've been able to stick with the program, though I'm much slower than my peers and on average it takes me twice as long to finish courses.

Well, six months into the program and I'm slowly beginning to realize that the reason I've never really been able to 'get it' is that I genuinely hate working with computers, and that scares the hell out of me. In the past few weeks I've found myself doing all the household chores I normally can't stand to procrastinate having to write code/study. I sit down, scroll up and down my 'notes' page a couple times, and say ""you know, I don't think the shower has been re-grouted in a while, better get on that"". My entire identity, for the past 24+ years, has been based on the idea that at some point I'll be some big shot tech guy. I literally have no other skills.

I feel like I've put all of my eggs (and at this point, enough money to buy a small home) into being 'the computer guy' and if I'm not that, I'm literally starting over from scratch. Technically starting from pre-scratch, because I honestly have no idea what else is out there. People online always say ""start with what you like"" but in my case I have no idea what I like because I've never tried anything else. I know I can't join the military, or go into the trades, because I'm moderately disabled (both mentally and physically).

I've written a novel here and it's certainly been cathartic but I also feel I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I honestly have no idea what I'm supposed to do at this point."
Has anybody had career setbacks due to mental illness?,"I'm currently working two jobs, a custom framer at a craft store and as a childcare worker. I have a BA in psychology, and I did well in college despite having a mental illness. I got an internship as a case worker for the county and have worked as a behavior therapist. As the years went by my mental illness got worse and I wasn't able to function. Symptoms of mania got worse. Depression got worse to the point where I was hospitalized twice. It was very difficult. When I worked psychology-related fields I found out that the field was too overwhelming for me. I just couldn't handle it. It's been 5 years since I graduated, and I've been stable. I go to therapy and take my medication. I use coping skills. I've been able to hold a retail job for 2 years and have had my childcare job for 3 months. I have an internship in an office as a development associate. I feel very lost because I struggle with money alot, and this stresses me out alot. I hope to find a job in an office soon, so I can have some stability. Eventually I would like to go back to school to become a speech language pathologist or an accountant. I'm not sure yet. 

Again, I feel lost and behind in life, but I'm trying really hard."
What is the difference between studying Applied Statistics vs Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Business Analytics?,"Hello all,

I'm researching for potential graduate study and I was wondering what is the difference between studying Applied Statistics vs Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Business Analytics and which would you advise to choose for someone interested in spreadsheets and data analysis.

Basically quantitative skills that help businesses save costs or increase their revenue.

Background:

Business and currently in digital marketing SEO/SEM. I am also learning SQL in my free time"
My company is an absolute mess. Can I say that in an interview?,"I work in a larger startup where people turnover is massive. Some people don’t even stay 1 year and leave as soon as they can.
My job title changed without me agreeing 3 times in 6 months and the new one is pending for months. It looks ridiculous but I need to get out of here.

I am experienced but my last two jobs were too short so I need to hold my breath currently and apply.

And advice how to say my company is a mess without disqualifying myself?

Thank you"
For those who were lost but found their calling. How did you figure it out?!,"I'm in Social Media Marketing and I am so done with it. I hate it. But I don't know what I want to do next and I have been lost for a long time. It gives me anxiety at night.

My question is where did you start? How did you figure out which direction to go? How did you make the transition?"
"Had a video interview this week and did not like the hiring manager (or the job, really). They have advanced me to another round of interviews. How do I politely decline with the hope to possibly find a job somewhere else in the company?","I know I shouldn’t turn down a job or an interview during these times, but the hiring manager was arrogant and seemed more toxic than my current manager. I am interested in the company, but not working for him or this specific role. It is a large company. TIA!
  
EDIT: the hiring manager WOULD be my direct boss. Does that change anyone’s opinion? Just curious."
How to learn soft skills?,"I've developed bad personality traits that impede my job search. I have skills which most employers like and invite me to interview but lack joyful, ecstatic, friendly skills. 

I consider myself to be a stoic type but it comes across as apathetic and lethargic.

Any ideas on how to improve? I do have a good work ethic but putting on a smiling face is hard for me."
"Unemployed, have had 1 interview in the past 4 months off of ~300 applications, running out of time/money/ideas. Headhunter needed? A smarter approach? Haven't applied for a job in around 6 years.","Hey all,

A little about what me and what I'm ultimately looking for:

I have 5 years of experience in management and logistic roles, one for a car manufacturer, the other for a major cell phone provider. I was part of a major lay off in January 2019, rode out my severance for a long time, but now the funds are running dry, and I am still getting nowhere with job applications. I've had my resume critiqued online and in person, and everyone says it is great, so I'm not totally sure why I am not getting any calls for interviews.

Since my main experience is in management, both retail and logistics, I've applied to a number of positions within Amazon, FedEx, UPS, corporate retail store locations, but I feel like my resume and application is mostly just going into the ""void"" as I call it, where it seems like maybe there is a fair bit of luck in getting seen. The other problem is, I haven't really had to job search for a long time in my life, since I graduated college essentially, so I'm about 8 years out of it. I've updated my resume, signed up for Indeed/LinkedIn/etc, but still feeling stuck. 

The past year I've had my hopes and dreams set on opening a business (bar/tavern/brewery), but I'm realizing I just don't have enough money unfortunately, even after working with the SBA and other organizations.

So where I'm at now is a dwindling bank account, and possibly needing to liquidate my 401k ~$26,000 to keep going until I find the right work that covers my expenses, and ultimately is something that is rewarding for me, aka I don't want to just work another dead end job through my 30s.

What I'm wondering now is, should I find a headhunter that maybe has connections in companies so I get noticed more? I'm in a city with lots of young professionals, so I'm feeling maybe my resume is lost in the void as I said earlier. Or do I need to find a new approach to applying for jobs in the even more internet age? Do I need a career shift? I've always thought CS/coding jobs sound great, especially with the high pay. I've looked into coding bootcamps, but for every positive I've seen about them, I've read equally negative things or how they aren't needed.

Thank you for anyone who reads any of this! I use Reddit for almost everything in life, maybe this will help spark some ideas as well :)"
Transitioning from academia to a corporate job. What is the single most important workplace mindset or etiquette to learn?,"I (35M) just got my first ""real"" job after 15+ years in academia. I've studied and/or worked in four universities in two countries. If it matters, my background is in computer science and physics, and I'll be working as a software engineer in a big corporation.

The academic environment is very different from that of a company. Hierarchy is often not completely clear, side projects are encouraged, hours are very flexible, no dress code, HR is nonexistent in practice, and oftentimes there's little or no feedback.

So what's the most important thing I should learn in terms of soft skills or corporate etiquette? Or unlearn, i.e., what academic behavior I should completely leave behind?

EDIT: Thank you all who took their time to answer, you've been extremely helpful."
I took about four months to take care of my mental health. How should I explain this gap in my upcoming interview?,"I suffered from depression and am in a much better place, but I would rather not disclose my mental health conditions. Help, please."
Why do people advise not to put in your 100% effort at work?,"For people working in corporate life in the 9-5 grind, I’ve read that you shouldn’t put in 100% or be too productive or else people will just add more work on your plate and not appreciate it. Also people might take advantage of you. Is this generally true? The flip side of the argument is that your boss might find out and sometimes working hard could get you more exposure with new projects. So how do you find the optimal balance between working hard and working just hard enough to get a promotion or salary increase?"
Got fired from a toxic workplace but feel guilty?,"I am 25 years old and I recently got fired from an extremely toxic work environment where I was working close to 50-60 hours a week but being paid for only 40, sometimes even on weekends to meet deadlines. It was taking a toll on me but I decided to try my best because it was an extremely well known company. On top of it, coworkers abused me on the internal chat and my manager didn’t pay any heed to it. However, the work culture is pretty well known to be harsh and cutthroat. I didn’t realise it was that bad before I joined.

During the mid term review of my probation they just said that I’m not a good fit for this position and handed me a letter of termination. I sunk and felt even more miserable than I was when I had the job. Now I’m in a confusing state of mind of being unemployed but also can’t help myself of thinking I could’ve tried harder or maybe tried to do things differently. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. Can anyone help me with some reassurance that what happened, happened for the best? Or is this on me?

EDIT: Thanks for all the support and love that you're giving me in spite of not knowing me personally. I truly feel better having seen these comments after the horrendous couple of months I spent at my workplace. You people are so understanding and great. Bless you all."
I've permanently ruined my life. What jobs can actually pay for cheap rent?,"I need more than 15 dollars an hour to pay rent off a 70 hour work week. Grubhub just cut our pay by 25%... again, bringing their pay in line with others like Uber. so im making 10 an hour. Honestly, 100 hours a week is unsustainable. 

Ok, information you need: I have a low IQ, the time i got a driving job at Jimmy johns it took me weeks to learn the menu which is supposed to be memorized before the first day; 

I worked two days outdoor manual labor but had severe cramps from dehydration and almost legit died. I actually enjoyed carrying around 100+ lb boxes in a warehouse freezer but that was 7.50 an hour. Not afraid of manual labor, just can't be outside in the heat;

 I have aspergers, so i REALLY suck at sales, passing interviews, customer service and such like; 

I have 130 college hours, but this does not include any third and fourth year courses because i failed them all. On paper im two years away from graduating, the reality is it's not going to happen;

 I have a cdl, this may be misleading to you. So i drove a truck for a year on a team, which is two drivers per truck, truck runs 24/7. On a team they pay both drivers the rate of the most experienced. So at the top of their pay scale i made 32 thousand that year typically working 6 hours more per week than is legal. Home daily trucking jobs are 12 to 14 per hour 2 years experience, no exceptions. The 32k job was listed as up to 75k on indeed just for context. Yes i can get paid 100k as a trucker if i buy a truck from them, but after payments and maintenance it works out to 50k per year for ten years! The super awesome part of this deal is that you can't drive a 3 year old truck for most trucking companies, so you have to give the truck back and lose all the payments you made. ""Welcome to American! Right this way, please spread your ass cheeks for your convenience sir!"" And im constantly seeing titles like ""Trucking companies can't understand why MilLeNialS refuse to work for them"". Well... it's because the pay is worse than cleaning toilets for McDonald's; 



and finally because ive been working as an independent contractor for the last three years most companies consider me to have been jobless for three years, even though ive been working 70 hours a week.



 STOP READING HERE! IM JUST ADDING CONTEXT. 



So my McDonalds interview is typical of how an interview works. They only hire ""Positive"" individuals, i don't understand what that means, but i came in with a big smile on my face and was yes sir yes maam the entire time. And of course i didn't get the job even with my one year Jimmy johns experience. Aspergers is like having a tattoo on your face, it doesn't matter how hard you try everyone knows their not supposed to hire you. 

The worst part about all of this is my parents disappointment. They cut all the job adds out if the news paper and ask me why im not applying anywhere. I used to say that i couldn't get an interview, but then my parents tell me to just go there in person. Every time ive gone somewhere in person ive been told they only do online applications. Now days i don't tell my parents how my job hunt is going. Real talk, ive counted the businesses in my (one of the top ten largest citys in the US) for different industries, and im legit running out of places to be rejected by. If i could get a job with even a glimmer of hope that i would be able to live a decent life. I would work 120 hours a week at literal running speed. I can make an assembly robot look lazy.  

 Hard work means nothing in America, this is purely an IQ economy and social IQ is the only IQ that matters. TLDR: Nobody is hiring aspergers, nobody, no exceptions, period.



EDIT: thanks for all the good suggestions, I'm applying for manufacturing jobs today, and if it doesn't work out i need to swallow my fears of moving and move to Alaska for a construction job in a climate where i can actually survive outdoors."
People with 2 jobs. Are you constantly tired or have you managed to make it work?,"I’m thinking about getting a second job but I don’t know if I’ll always be exhausted. Do you think working from 11pm-7am and then a different job from 8am-4pm appropriately 5 days a week is unreasonable?

Update: Thanks for all the responses everyone! I appreciate hearing about your experiences. The majority consensus I’ve gained from you is 2 back to back full time jobs aren’t a good idea.

Also a few of you have asked, the reason I want a second is money. My current job is horrible pay but it’s good experience for my degree. So I’m looking for a second job in any field. I’m not struggling right now but I’m in my 20s still living with my parents, I want to save enough money to get my own apartment already."
25 and my career is RUINED. How do I get it back on track?,"Hey everyone! I need some help. I am a 25-year-old college grad, trying to pursue a career in marketing/ media. However, due to a series of setbacks (some of them my fault, others not so much), my resume is terrible. It's basically a collection of short-term jobs, all of which have had really terrible endings...which is also an issue because it makes me uncomfortable using references. My work history is riddled with gaps, as well.

I feel like I'm in a hole, and don't know how to get my career back on track. I have so many resume gaps, and haven't even had one job for an entire year yet. I really want to start working on my professional goals, but feel as though a couple wrong moves that I made immediately after graduating have set the tone for my career moving forward- and it's very far from the one I wanted.

***Please note:*** *While grad school would be a good solution, I cannot afford it and even if I could, I've missed the deadlines for several schools with ""mandatory summer starts""; meaning I'd have to wait until summer 2021 to start, which isn't an option.*

Here is a **timeline of my professional life since graduation**.

**Background:** 

\-Graduated in 2017 with a major in Media Studies (focused in Advertising) and minors in both Marketing and Creative Writing. 

\-Had a few great internship opportunities, while still in school- one with a major media company (wound up not working out because I lived in Virginia and couldn't get to Los Angeles in the time span they gave me), and the other was a remote internship with a large online magazine, which I completed.

\-Graduated with honors, 3.3 Cumulative GPA and 3.6 Major GPA.

\-Was in long-term relationship (nearly 5 years) with guy whose graduation was pushed back a year, due to changing majors- meaning, he was staying in the college town and I would be too, seeing as we'd been living together for years.

**Timeline:**

***May 2017-*** Graduated

***Summer 2017-*** Worked at marketing internship w/ large restaurant chain in college town, in order to stay with boyfriend. 

***Fall 2017-*** Took a call center job, in order to make money while job hunting. Still doing this to stay with boyfriend. *Stupid decision.*

***December 2017-*** Could not find job. Got cheated on. Wound up quitting call center job, breaking up with boyfriend, and moving back in with parents.

***Winter 2018-*** Applied for full-time jobs, while working as a ""temp"" secretary (with some unofficial marketing work) at a real estate company, through a staffing agency.

***Spring 2018-*** Could not find a full-time marketing job, with so little experience. Was offered a full-time job with Real Estate company, a.k.a. ""buyout"" from staffing agency, so I would be an official employee, not a temp. Promised marketing/social media responsibilities. Decided to pursue this. Even submitted application and deposit for company-owned apartment next to office.

***May 2018-*** One manager turned out to be mentally unhinged. Stole my $250 deposit for the apartment, stole my SSN, and more. Upper management knew she had done this for days before reporting it to me. (Long story). I quit the job.

***June 2018-*** Got together with new boyfriend. Applied for marketing jobs, but was unsuccessful. Temp agency stopped working with me because I had called the authorities on my former employer for stealing from me. Basically said that their business w/ the company was more important than me.

***July 2018-*** Boyfriend got job with large tech company in Silicon Valley. I had always wanted to go to California and so had he, so we decided to take a leap of faith and go, despite me not having a job lined up. Stupid decision.

***August 2018-*** Moved to Cali. Had been applying and still was. No responses.

***Fall 2018-*** Job hunt unsuccessful. Even fast food places weren't hiring. Too many people, not enough jobs. Did not have a car, which lowered the radius I could travel and hurt my chances further. Went into crushing debt.

***Winter 2018-*** Went home alone for a month or so, to get my finances back under control. Applied for jobs.

***January 2019-*** Received job offer from startup in Silicon Valley. Accepted offer and returned to boyfriend in California.

***Winter/Spring 2019-*** Worked my a\*\* off for company, barely making anything ($20/hr in San Fran- no time and a half for overtime, which happened a lot). Started to notice some shifty things about them- paying me through Venmo-like app, no incoming revenue, etc. 

***May 2019-*** Found out from people ""working for us"" that they were being tricked into free labor. Tried to talk to employer to fix this and make company legitimate, but was shut down. Started applying for other jobs.

***Early July 2019-*** Startup tanking. People quitting left and right. Mental health rapidly declining. Received offer for a job a few states away, so I quit and moved with my boyfriend.

***Late July 2019-*** Got to new city after a long road trip. Called new employer to verify address and start time for first day that Monday. Found out that they had decided to hire an internal candidate at the last minute, and I was never informed. At this point, I'm in a new city and I'm homeless and unemployed.

***August 2019-*** Started working with local temp agency. Got good Marketing gig. Pay was low, but it was work. The contract was for one month, but they were planning on hiring me full-time after it ran out. Even had me write out a list of things I needed for the Marketing department for upcoming year, in order to get them approved during budget meetings. They were approved.

***September 2019-*** Received a phone call on one month anniversary of starting job. It was the temp agency. They said the company couldn't afford to hire me, so they were taking me off the position immediately and would find something else for me. I was devastated, but had no say. Contract said company couldn't work directly with me for a year after contract ended.

***Fall 2019-*** Temp agency could not find anything and basically ghosted. Unemployed, except for an odd job here or there. Broke. Crippling debt getting worse. Applying for jobs every day. Unsuccessful. Every marketing company that contacted me back was one of those MLM scam agencies, posing as legit businesses. 

***November 2019-*** Went home again for financial and health reasons. Kept applying for jobs.

***December 2019-*** Had a few interviews, but got turned down for a few things due to being home for the holidays. Finally got an offer for a phone sales role. I had little interest, but needed the income.

***March 2020-*** Have been working at new job since early January 2020. Pay is low. Hours are long. Metrics are unreasonable, and valued over actual productivity. Forced overtime with no pay. Employer won't even let us work from home during Coronavirus outbreak- despite having the tech to do so and confirmed/suspected cases among employees. I need to find a new job to transition into, once quarantine is over. 

&#x200B;

**So, here I am.** In the past, I've been told by hiring managers that my short-term assignments, lack of updated references, and resume gaps are red flags. I get that 100%. However, ever since graduating, I've been applying to crazy amounts of jobs each year and have been getting turned down due to lack of experience for 95% of those. Meanwhile, the jobs that have interviewed/ hired me have unfortunately been so easy to get a job with, or so it would appear, because they're not good companies to work for.

I am so set back in my life right now, all while desperately trying to get out of debt, get legal help for the cases that require it, and get my career started. I'm so depressed having to pay my student loans each month, despite not having worked one day in a full-time, salaried marketing role since finishing school.

&#x200B;

**What can I do (other than go to grad school), to get my career back on track?**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Since graduation, I haven't been able to secure a good job due to lack of experience. The companies that have hired me have been terrible to work for, resulting in short employment periods, a lack of recent references, and lots of resume gaps. This is affecting my ability to get a good job in my field and I don't know how to turn things around. Please help."
Anyone else regret their medical career?,"Healthcare field is quite terrible. It's plagued with chronic short staffing and misery loves company types.

Not to mention how difficult the barrier to entry is and the lack of upward mobility without more education."
What kind of things can I do to calm down about my first post-college job?,"Just starting my first job; overwhelmed and nervous about everything

I just started my first job after college and almost everything is getting to me. It’s like I’m having an existential crisis. The biggest problem is that there is no definitive end like there was in school. It’s a totally different scenario than school and I am not used to it yet. I am also going through a health issue and that adds stress. My job pays well and has good benefits and I am thankful for that. I also know I’m not stuck here forever and I am using this as experience and a learning moment.

Any tips for me to feel more comfortable?"
Has anyone ditched their 9-5 for something with weirder hours?,"Im a 22M 4 months into my (accounting) 9-5 job, which is actually more like an 8-6. Sometimes worse. I hate it. My SO is an overnight nurse who works 36 hours a week (3- 12 hour shifts), makes more, and sometimes even has 6 days in a row off. I’m so envious of her work life.

So, has anyone here left their 9-5 for something with less structure? I have no responsibilities outside of myself, so it’s not like kids are preventing me from doing this. I can’t stand sitting at my desk 10 hours, barely moving, and then doing it again 4 more times."
What can I do to start a meaningful career?,"I'm 29 years old, and I still work a shitty minimum wage job that just doesn't pay the bills.

I went to college, I took Business Administration, and graduated in 2013. I had a few part time book keeping jobs over the years, but overall I never really benefited from this degree. I've had a number of jobs paying minimum wage or barely higher since then, most of them customer service, and a couple manual labor. I currently work with a retail inventory service as an inventory counter; I scan and count, there's nothing demanding or rewarding about it.

I want to do something with my life, I have a very low standard of living at the moment, and I'm really sick of living like this.

My issue is that I just have no idea what I should be doing to improve my life. Simply applying for jobs has been unfruitful, I'm unqualified for pretty much any well paying job, my education is dated, and business diplomas seem to be a dime a dozen. I could possibly take out another student loan and give college another shot, but I fear that I will have the same issue of not finding meaningful employment afterwards. I've thought about developing some computer skills through online courses (Code Academy, Udemy, Skillshare), and I've done a bit of that, but I'm still not sure how employable I can become being entirely self taught, and I'm not entirely sure a programming job would be right for me.

I'm pretty clueless when it comes to job hunting to be honest, it's kind of embarassing; being stuck in life like this feels awful. I could really use the wisdom of a kind stranger."
How do you start wanting to work again?,"At 35, I am completely burnt out on my career. I got my PhD in a technical field. Afterward, I was briefly in academia. By the time I moved into industry 3 years ago, I already hated everything about the field I work in. After my time in companies, the idea of having to do anything for anyone (in a transactional, work-related way) makes me physically ill.

It's been over a year since I last applied for a job. If I see a job I'm qualified for, I give up at the thought of having to lie to someone's face and pretend any kind of enthusiasm for technical work. When someone asks me about ""data"", or ""machine learning"", it's the best I can do to hold back my bile.

If I see a job in a different career (and hence something I might potentially hate less), I'm turned off simply by the idea of having to self-promote.

I'm trapped by my semi-irrational avoidance of work-related bullshit, even as I miss being engaged in projects and... having good week days. I know to get out of this situation (whether that means career change or whatever), I am going to have to get through distasteful and uncomfortable situations, but I don't know if I \*can\* anymore.

I miss feeling excited and motivated by a new challenge, but I don't know how to recover that mindset. Anything positive about work  - whether money or the work itself - is completely overshadowed by the nightmare of politics and hierarchy. I also despise anything related to writing/creating software (which seems to be all anyone wants me to do).

I'm currently employed, but I dread every day of work and do the absolute bare minimum possible. It's not good.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I get out of this?

Edit: Overwhelmed by the response to this. Thanks everyone."
Unprofessional or Just Overreacting?,"I just received a call from someone who said they found my resume on careerbuilder and I looked like a good match for a job. He didn't even tell me the company name or what they do but he told me in order to keep going with that he needs 3 references from me and he's going to call them before he moves further with me 😂 I told him I'm not giving out random numbers to a guy I don't know and who won't tell me about the company or Job. He said said that's the only way we can move forward with it. I hung up on him then he called back and left me a voicemail saying his manager will be calling me at 3pm for 3 references. Anyone think I'm overreacting, or is this extremely unprofessional?"
Any graduate still applying for jobs/finding it hard to get a job?,"I'm working on an online series/doing some research for a media company atm. I'm trying to find a graduate (who left uni 1-3 years ago) who hasn't been able to get a job in their chosen field. It would ideally be someone who's applied for lots of jobs but hasn't been able to get one in the area they want yet. (This is for a non creative job role so could include but not limited to business, medicine, science, accounting etc) 

 It personally took me a while after I graduated to follow a career path so I feel like I know the struggle.

Is there anyone from the UK who wouldn't mind speaking to me in more detail?"
Ever apply for a job just to see if you get an interview?,"I have a job now, been here for 4 months, but I like to explore my options.  The people I work with currently are nice, however, I recently found out I have to work on the holidays.  I have two interviews lined up to learn more about the positions I applied for and the company itself.  Do you guys think there is anything wrong with that?"
Want a way to get in the door to your dream job?,"Hi guys. Just want to share my story. I recently got into Reddit and saw this community. 
I just want to share my story here. I had a one hour interview with two managers. She said will let me know by next week. I walked out feeling not too great but then got a phone call only two hours later with an offer. Keep in mind, it’s a position that I wanted to get into since graduation so you can say is a dream position. I am nervous but excited too! It is in a field that is highly competitive and in a big city with lots of competition. 

After I calm down more, I reflect on what I have done to prepare for this. One of the managers know me just once a few months ago. She remembered my name and face and smiled when seeing me in the interview. 

Let me take you back with my strategy. I would say, if you want something badly, you need to find an alternative way to let the corresponding HR see your face or know your name at some way. 

I was so interested in this field of medicine, but the problem I had was I know nobody that works in this field at the time. My first strategy was to figure out how I can get into this community. 
Tip #1: find the job’s relevant association/club/society. For example, if you are interested in a psychology position, find the non-profit organization that support psychologists for education/network etc. I found a general request for more info box on he organization web page, and I wrote down something along the lines of: I am very interested in the field, can you connect me which someone that is in the field at XXX city area? I didn’t expect a reply honestly but I did and the secretary had found somebody in their organization that works in the field at my city that is interested in helping me. 

Tip #2: this person is a coordinator for the local part of the organization and willing to connect with me for some shadow days (after I requested it after some friendly and professional emails back-forth). I shadowed her for few days, on my last day (after strategically asking around where the managers’ office is), I went in person to talk to her (manager A) and hands a copy of my resume. I introduced myself to the manager and told her how I got in contact with the person I shadowed. She was very nice and accepted the resume but did say she has to go through the fair system of picking online process over paper. 

I didn’t hear back anything for about half a year. Honestly, mindset is so important. I didn’t focus too much on it but just have a mindset that it’s not in my control but I tried! I was able to make a connection at least! So I was happy and doing my other job in the meantime. I keep applying to the place I hand the resume to but didn’t really hear back. 

Last month, I decided it’s time to add spice to my “game”. I emailed the manager this time stating who I was and that I am still interested. I told her in the email that I have applied to the positions your department posted so please look out for that. 
I didn’t receive a reply. 

One week later, I got a phone call from the other manager B (to my very surprise since I didn’t know there were two!) and wanted to see me for an interview. 

Story goes back to now, I met the two managers. Manager A stated nice to see me again and remembered who I was. She said she forwarded my email to manager B. Manager B said that was very nice. 

At the end, the interview was challenging. But what I have learnt in this process that lasts almost half a year is so important. I also don’t think I was the most qualified candidate with the most matched experience and physical skills the job required. I believe my persistence helped them to make the decision to hire me. They know I am interested. They know I really wanted the job. They know I shadowed somebody under the team to know a little bit about the job. They know I put in real time and effort to make them know I want the job. 

I guess what I want to say is, don’t get frustrated with the process. Find a way to let them see you; find a way to let them know your name and intention. Best of luck!"
"I’m not very good at my job, and I’m failing. How do I get out with my reputation intact?","So basically I’m working as a social media manager, one day a week. I was hired because I’ve successfully managed a very large group that contained the brands target audience. I also successfully manage the page of a personal project of mine, and was part of Facebook’s community leaders programme. 

I had been working previously in politics in a communications role after graduating in 2018. The politics contract was very high level but it was only to cover a maternity leave, but it was a great opportunity at my stage in my career and I came out of it with my reputation enhanced. It was not a social media job, and was mainly geared towards traditional media.

I’m hoping to get back into the world of politics and communications full time, but in the meantime I was offered to take on this job. I wanted to make sure my CV didn’t lie empty in between jobs, the extra cash was of course appreciated and thought I’d be good at it. I thought wrong. 

I can’t stand my boss, I think the brand I’m working for is toxic, for example we were forced to turn off reviews. But anyway I’m three months in and realise that the Coronavirus has wrecked profits for the brand, and my social media posts aren’t reaching acceptable levels. We have a following of around 5000, and the reach of our posts is around 180. 

The money I get paid isn’t very much, but I’m afraid that I’ll get sacked, or I’ll quit and it’ll put off future employers. I don’t think the agency I’m working for would provide glowing references. 

So basically do I quit or hold out? Wipe it off my CV and just not mention it, or just leave it up and hope for the best? It’s been a big misstep and I wish I hadn’t done it."
I am 40 and cannot read due to disability. Just lost my job. Can you suggest a good path forward before I lose my house and family?,"I don't intend this to be a thread about why I can't read, so I'll keep that story short. Lasik messed me up. Can't look at cell phones, watch TV, etc. I can do some minimal computer typing, but mostly I do it with eyes closed and then go back and double-check it at a glance.

I worked my way up in an industry over 17 years. Then, due to politics, some people fired me at a time when I'm raising a family. Because my disorder is so strange, I can't tell people in job interviews- it just makes me sound insane or stupid. But its extremely hard to find something not involving too much computer work or cell phones.

I'd love to learn a trade, but I cannot read magazines or text books. Can't go back to school. There are some audiobooks, but not enough to learn something like car repair.

I don't intend this to be a crying fit. I just honestly ask myself what direction I can take before I lose my house and my family. Thanks ahead of time for your guidance."
Can't get hired because I have no experience; can't get experience because I can't get hired. Advice for newly graduated writer?,"My first real post! Let's go. I'm desperate. **HELP!**

I just graduated in December '19 with my BA in English-Writing. I'm F, 26. Was going to go into education, but for a multitude of reasons, instead of teaching English I decided I wanted to *write*. I love to write anything. Poetry, creepy short stories, proposals, memos, academic materials and research...ANYTHING. I love the process and its really the only thing I'm good at. BUT. I have worked in customer service for 10 freaking years. I've lived w/ my SO since I was 19 and had to always work to pay bills, so unpaid internships were never an option. I had to take breaks between semesters because I couldn't afford to take time off of work to take classes. It's been a struggle bus to the finish line, but I graduated with a 3.8 GPA so that's cool. But now I have no experience in WRITING. Just customer service and restaurant experience. My portfolio is a few academic essays that I want to eventually get published, but that is about it. I have no real ""published"" samples to send with job applications, no real ""office setting"" experience because those jobs are Mon-Fri and I was in school, and no internship experience. All my counselors keep telling me is to ""get a masters and you could teach"", ""you have the GPA for masters"", ""publish your academic work"", yadada...I NEED REAL ADVICE. I could just go back to customer service, but I want to be in my field and making more than minimum wage, cause, ya know, STUDENT LOANS?

What was your first real writing job? What did you put on your resume? Did you freelance? Tutor? Is being a journalist a real option? HELP. And thanks in advance.

**TLDR;** Writers, what entry level jobs would help me in my career of being a writer?

\[Note: I'm not trying to write novels. Technical writing, content creation, and satirical work (think Onion) are fields I'm most interested in.\]

**EDIT:** Thanks to everyone for taking the time to respond! Seems like the majority say ""freelance"", which is what I plan to pursue now. Lots of people have provided some great sources for that and good starting points. And others have suggested other entry level positions that I can use to widen my job search. This helped a lot and I have a clearer path in mind. <3"
What is the fastest way to kickstart my life as a 31 yo who wasted his life so far but wants to do whatever means necessary?,"I would like to hear solid advice (by that I mean an opinion out of your expertise and experience and not just citing what google brings up on good paying entry level jobs since I already read that stuff) 

I am 31 and wasted my life due to various issues (clean record no drugs or anything but its a very long story to explain so lets leave it at that. ).

I have a non existing CV nothing solid. 

I know computer stuff (some programming, some pc architecture, some networking, some soldering and pcb diagnostics etc) but nothing on paper (either in form of certificates or provable employment ).

I have studied for a year (out of a 4 year graduate program) as a merchant marine engineer and worked for 6 months in a cargo ship as a cadet engineer. 

I have some (non provable) experience in door to door sales and phone support. 

I can speak 3 languages (English, German, Greek and a little bit French).

I am able to type ~150 words per second. 

I am a MENSA member (I know cheesy but at this point I think it might hold some significance in terms of indicating that there is a chance that I could learn something faster than average). 

I have worked as a waiter in a  fancy restaurant of a 5 star hotel.

I have some mathematics and physics skills as a drop off of an applied mathematics university.

I consider myself good in marketing and sales and have some sense of logistics in general. 

I am not afraid to work hard for long hours and do whatever (legal ).

I am from Greece and I am looking for employment anywhere within europe or north America.

My target is to work hard for 2-4 years and make some substantial savings that would allow me to stop working or work part time while pursuing my degree (and be able to pay for all the fees involved).

What do you think would be the fastest **realistic** way for me to do that?

And to prevent trolling no I am not sitting on my ass waiting for the internet to give me a solution but in the desperate position I am now a second opinion might aid to clarify my perspective.

Right now I am looking into getting a job in an offshore oil rig but I get mixed information for example I found that in many cases one can get as low as 1500 pounds a month.... which is not bad but considering you will cut off from society, eating canned food and that it is physically challenging job 1500 begins to seem small. Do you think I could do better than that ?

I thank you in advance."
Is it okay to quit a job if its causes high anxiety? I cant deal with rejecting sick animals.,"I had recently (1 month) started a job at an animal hospital and I thought it would be great. I love animals. I mean LOVE. I figured I could just try a part time job to see if I would maybe want to be a Vet in the future. Except from this job it was mostly just dealing with difficult clients. Like ones that belittle you and insult you. I could deal with mean clients. I've worked customer service in the food industry, but what got to me was the sick pets.

We would often get calls from owners asking if we can see their sick pets. Throwing up, seizing, itching, diarrhea, etc. It had a wide range. But the common thing was the pet was sick and the owner wanted them seen ASAP i.e. same day. Obviously I get why the owners would freak out and cause trouble but what really was causing me the emotional stress was having to refuse seeing their pets. This could happened several times a day and nearly every day I worked. We had to refuse to see the pet because there was only 1 doctor working at that hospital and we were constantly over booked and under staffed. 

When ever I had to refuse to schedule to see the sick pet that day I would try to make a future appointment for them but we were always booked out 2-3weeks out. The only other options was to direct the pet owner to another hospital or emergency hospital. This was often met with things like ""You're heartless to animals!"" or ""you guys really dont care huh?"" Like I said I've been cussed out by customers in the food industry before but it really hurts to be called heartless to animals when I really love them a lot. It just hit deep in my core. I dont know. I'm weak I guess. But this just ruined the work for me. 

I dreaded going into work each day. I fear clients calling about a sick pet. The work itself was already hard, requiring 4+ weeks of computer trainning and ~2 months of shadow trainning. I could have eventually adjusted to the hardships of the job, but the emotional anxiety just makes me want to give up. I wanted to quit week 1 but I tried to stick it out till now 1 month later. 

I know jobs can take a while to learn. I've have my hand in several other jobs in the past ranging 6 months to 2 years long. This just hurts and it's only been 1 month. 

I've written a letter of resignation and I plan to email it to my manager. I will text him to check his email. In my letter I said I want to quit immediately as I am still being shadow trained so I'm not covering any actually shifts and figured I might as well stop wasting the time of who is trainning me. I did offer to stay for 2 weeks if they wanted me to. 

I just want to know if this is the right way to do this? Is there a better way I should deliver my resignation? Can I quit without 2 weeks notice?

Should I even be quitting just because its emotionally destroying me? It has actually caused me to be getting sick recently and I cant focus in class. 

What do I do?

TLDR: Job causes me high anxiety because it deals with turning away sick pets and I love animals and just want to help them. I get yelled at by the concerned pet owners regularly. How do I quit in a professional way? Can I quit same day if they dont actually need me?

Edit: Maybe this will help some people. I am still living at home so rent isnt my concerned yet. Also some have been saying I need to suck it up bc I want to work as a Vet but I took this job to see if I was interested, not that this is my future career goal. I am actually studying Molecular Biology to work in the Biotech Industry currently. This job has solidified that I dont want to be a Vet. Also some have said this is the reality of the work force, so suck it up. Like I've said I have worked customer service before. I can deal with some crazy yelling at me about coffee being too hot or whatever. Just not this side of denying a sick pet. I'll respond to ppl directly after work...."
Does anyone here experience imposter syndrome?,"Does anyone struggle with imposter syndrome? I have been in my industry for about 4 years, and have taken quite a bit of licensing/continuing education to progress my career. However, sometimes I still feel inadequate and feel stressed when I don't know the answer to something. Does anyone else experience this or have tips on how to deal with it?"
Do people really enjoy their careers?,"Like is this a normal feeling for people? Because I'm trying to figure out why does every career/job in life sound so boring to me?

I'm in my mid 20's and I'm trying to leave my miserable restaurant job.  I'm currently in school now and I hate it. I've switched majors like 3 times an I'm still bored. I've tried marketing, accounting and business admin and none of those fields interest me. I've looked at other areas of work outside school **(IT/WEB DEV, trade school and military)** but they also sound either too hard or boring.

All I have is like 7 years of restaurant experience. This is a toxic industry and I want to get out now, but I'm not sure what else I can do."
What is your opinion of a person at work that is very quiet?,"Not to mention, I’m one of the newer employees and the youngest. I’ve been at my current job for 8 months and started with someone the same time. She’s older than me but friendly with everyone. Another advisor started a few months after us but got the job because she used to work with our boss. She’s older too but gets along with everyone. Essentially everyone I work with talks amongst each other. I don’t talk unless spoken to, only a few people talk to me. I’m very quiet and I feel like I will be disregarded for possible promotions/training opportunities because of how quiet I am. My  boss had to ask me when I first started within my first 3 months if I had an issue with anyone because I don’t talk. I just have a fear of coming across as stupid and terrible time trusting people. I don’t hear complaints about me but I just refuse to open up. Is there an issue or should I be worried?"
"When the job ad says 'tell us about yourself', what kind of information do they want to hear?","Do they want you to answer in a professional manner or in a casual 'I like watching movies and Thai food' type of way? Or maybe of a mix of both... but then how do you go from 'I can type at 50wpm' into 'The last book I read was \_\_\_\_'?

I've never been good at answering these types of questions so if you can provide a short example that'd be most appreciated.

Edit: The 'tell us about yourself' question was followed by 'For example, how do you usually spend your Tuesday nights?'

Edit: I took all your advice and finally bit the bullet and applied. Thanks for all the help and suggestions, you guys! Hope they like what I wrote!"
"How do you network when you’re reserved, shy, and closed-off?","Basically, how do you network when you’re not fake? 

Background: I’ve had (and continue to have) SO MUCH networking opportunities that could really benefit me, but I’m way too closed-off and fucked up to entertain anyone who talks to me, let alone go up to people and start a conversation. 

Of course, I’m sure not everyone wants to connect with a happy-go-lucky person and some people appreciate the more serious, calm, and genuine personality.... but I’m really struggling to even have normal conversations with people who could truly help me, I know it has to do with me being fucked up internally/emotionally, but I would really appreciate some advice to help at the moment as I can very *very* rarely carry on a conversation without it becoming awkward (even when I want to!!!!!!)

I would really appreciate any advice :(

Edit: Just to clarify, I wasn’t referring to outgoing/talkative people when I said  “fake people”. I’m talking about people who put on a fake smile and use a high-pitched voice and act extremely polite to people they know they can get something from. I’ve seen these kinds of people and the second their target turns around they roll their eyes or just talk shit about them behind their back, or later on they’ll admit they actually hated them. I know that “you gotta do what you gotta do” to get places in life, but I’m just struggling to do that because I hate the fake pretentious atmosphere since I’m a very undiplomatic blunt person and if I don’t love someone I won’t entertain them. I hate “not living my truth” as cringey as that may sound. Idk how else to put it but I just want advice on how to do well in this game without stopping down that low."
How do you shut off work-brain and turn on life-brain?,"I have this bad habit of always constantly thinking about work and I don't know why. To clarify, I work in social media, digital marketing, and work with small brands and businesses. It's hard not to think about the work I do since I literally see the work I do on my phone, when using instagram or Facebook. Also, if I was working on a specific task that day, I'm always thinking about ways to improve processes or flows. For someone who's an account manager, and manages a book of business, it's not easy to just shut off that part of your brain. Social media is 24/7, and anything can happen at a minutes notice. Couple with the fact that advertising is a major field and things are always evolving, hmmm."
I feel like I’ve failed at 26. Is there a way forward?,"Hope this doesn’t turn out too long.

I lost my mom at the start of college. It did me no favors as she was the only positive person in my life. College didn’t work out for me and I never graduated. I feel like I’ve failed massively in this regard. I studied networking (IT)

I have a decent gig right now making 40k-ish a year. However, I wanted to be so much more. I wanted to be able to support myself and my elderly father. I feel like I’ve peaked with what I’m working with right now. I talked to school counselors and discovered I’d have to start all the way from gen ed and basically redo a whole degree. This was super disheartening. I also don’t have the luxury of  quitting my job in order to focus on school as me and my father have supported each other since my mom died.  Also, even if I went back to school, I would not continue down the networking path as it is definitely not for me.

So I feel pretty stuck. My job is not a bad job, but like I said, I feel like I’ve peaked. I want to move upwards in life, and by that I don’t mean I want fancy things and wealth. I mean that I want stability, safety, and security for me and my loved ones. I don’t want to just get by and be at risk for losing it all. I miss feeling like I was building a life back when I was still in school. 

Has anyone here been in a similar situation? Anyone have advice for me?


EDIT: Guys I am going to respond to all of your comments once I get a chance later today. I didn’t think this would gain any traction. Thank you so much"
How do some people change careers so easily?,"For example, I was reading an article recently and it mentioned this woman.

During her career, she worked as a chief publicist in multiple countries, owned an online activeware company, was a therapeutic riding instructor, and developed waterproof shoe covers. And she’s only in like her 40’s! And only has 1 undergrad degree in psychology!

How the heck does one person accomplish so much? Is it money, connections, good timing, work ethic, having versatile skills, luck? A combination of factors?

Then you have someone else for example, who has like a Masters degree or something, and it stuck working retail for years and is dying to get out.

Or maybe you have someone who is an accountant, and wants to become an engineer. They would have to spend years and thousands of dollars to change careers, whereas some people switch fields like it’s nothing?

How come some people are able to do so much, while others just flounder?

Just curious. Thank you!

EDIT: Wow, thank everyone!! I didn’t think anyone would respond to this!! I can’t wait to get home so I can read through everyone’s replies! :)"
What are some quiet careers where you work alone or with less social interaction?,"I'm looking for quiet careers, in a low volume workplace where you can be autonomous and have little micromanaging.

I figure work from home and entrepreneur jobs are an option. But I'm curious of others."
"Which jobs allow extreme flexibility, good pay, and very little work?","Before I get any preachy comments like ""get your head out of your ass, everyone has to work hard to make $$$."" It's simply not true. I'll give you examples:

My brother is a stunt man in the movie industry. He just fell into it because of his look. No prior training. He works on average 2 months out of the entire year. Most of his stunt jobs are either very easy (some actors need a stunt double even just to run), or very safe (things that look dangerous in the movies are actually very controlled). He says he  shouldn't get paid the amount he does for the work. He makes well over 6 figures, when you include the steady royalties checks he gets monthly.

Next up. Owners of parking lots in congested areas. My friend's father does it. He has 4 lots downtown. He makes over a million a year. He golfs every day.

Alright. Hopefully commentors can add to this list. Thanks"
Will I get blacklisted for reserving my legal rights with a would-be employer?,"Without going into too much identifying detail. I work in creative/tech in a large North American city and recently interviewed for a lucrative contract role for a Fortune 500 company. 

The hiring manager and I mostly communicated through the recruiter at first but after several phone screenings and a great on-site interview, he started to personally call and email me. He offered effusive praise such as “everybody loves you” and told me that the job was basically in the bag. He even went as far as to tell me that they were not interviewing other candidates. I was thrilled!

The only catch? I had to complete a hiring assignment. OK, no problem.

I’ve accepted these in the past but usually they are only 1 to 2 hours at most. This one was easily 12 hours of work that I diligently completed and even went above and beyond in many respects. I had a friend of mine who is senior in the industry review my work and she agreed that it was very high-quality after I made just a couple of tweaks.

Getting to the point, the hiring manager totally blew me off and went with another candidate after I busted my ass doing this take-home assignment. I started to get suspicious of his motivations based on several red flags I regretted ignoring. Couldn’t even get any meaningful feedback from him.

Had an attorney write a letter to the company’s head general counsel reserving my copyright to the content and affirming they don’t have the right to use it. The wording was low-key, factual, and professional. 

I’m not trying to get any payment from them, just protecting my rights not to have free work extracted from me by a potential employer just to be ghosted after false promises.

I feel good about standing up for myself not be taken advantage of but now I’m worried that this guy will go and drag my name around the industry. Has anyone else ever done this and how did it go for you in your subsequent job search?"
Low stress and flexible jobs?,"I just quit my brutal job doing industrial construction working 70+ hours a week in awful conditions. That job really broke me and makes me never wanna work again. I have business aspirations but I need a job to bridge the gap until I get there. I need something that gives me freedom to live my life how I’d like to, whether it’s work from home or independent contractor work or whatever, I don’t care. Money is lower on the priority list. I just wanna do something somewhat productive that doesn’t make me wanna kill myself."
"Am I scaring off employers when i tell them what I currently earn? How do you properly answer ""Whats your expected salary"" question?","Ive been doing freelance for more than a year now and I earn so much more compared to when I was in full time. Now im looking for a full time job but cant seem to land a job. Some are giving me offers but are super low. 

Some I dont even get a second interview cause im sure its because I tell them what i currently earn. I always say its ""negotiable"" cause the setup for full time is very different. 

How should I properly answer what my expected salary is? Some jobs on indeed they show their salary range. Should i just stick to that? To be honest, now im just desperate to just land a job. But i want to also be given the best offer."
Is there a time limit before one HAS to take on a leadership position in order to stay relevant and hireable?,"I keep getting this advice from everyone and its getting kind of annoying. 

Im sure there are definitely cases where this was the case but isnt real life more nuanced than that? 

The arbitrary period is 3 to 4 years from what im hearing before you must transition to leadership.

What about specialization? 

Who in the world can be an expert in ANY field in 3 to 5 years?? 
Isnt base line competency and knowledge a prerequisite to leading well?

Like really now. 

Please share with me your thoughts"
I recently accidentally found out that I'm going to be terminated this week or next week (sometime soon) through an email that wasn't meant for me. What should I do about this?,"It's a tad complicated but long story short, I use an iPad that I share with my boss at my job for doing my daily duties. I unlocked it and on the screen was an email between my boss, his manager and the HR rep about how my time there is limited and originally they were going to let me go last week but the new hire was on vacation. The language in the email was pretty insulting tbh as I have a medical condition that involves a compromised immune system, so I get sick about once per month for a day or two, and they were calling me a 'pussy' and a 'punk' for calling in sick so frequently. Nobody knows about my condition because my boss has repeatedly said, ""if you're sick, just call in sick, I don't need a reason or an excuse."" Is this grounds to terminate me? Personally I hate this job so it might be a blessing in disguise but it's hard to find a decent paying job out here with my job experience (or lack thereof). I've been spending a lot of my time looking for a new job already but nothing so far. I live in Vancouver, BC of that helps anything. I've also been made aware that starting this month, each employee is entitled to 5 sick days per year. I have two documented. Is it a really bad idea to take a few sick days to get my max because they're firing me anyway? (Obviously I wouldn't say it that way to management...) Any advice on this would be appreciated.

Edit: I was diagnosed last week with an immunosuppressive disorder so I didn't know about it going into the job. 

Edit 2: Well as of an hour ago I'm jobless. I get two weeks of severance pay and 1 month until my benefits run out. I think that's not terrible considering I was about 2 weeks away from quitting because I hate the job anyway. Blessing in disguise? Thanks y'all for your responses. Still peeved I couldn't find the damn 'pussy' email..."

Unpaid trial period for a job I might not even get - Is this a waste of my time?,"Hi, all. I lost my job due to COVID and job searching has been a bit of a nightmare since. I work in a rather niche tech field and usually land interview after interview, but now I can’t get a prospective employer to even email me back. I interviewed with a company that seemed like it could be a good fit, but they are requiring an unpaid “trial period” (essentially a working interview) that could last several weeks. I should reiterate, this is a successful company with a good reputation. 

If I get the job after, I get a solid salary and benefits, if I don’t, it was a ROYAL waste of my life. Under any other circumstance, I wouldn’t even consider this. But times are tough and I’m willing to make some sacrifices. The more I think about it, I fail to see how this is even remotely fair to me. I’d much rather work for an employer who trusts my experience, references, and abilities right from the get-go. This trial sends a message of distrust - Especially since it isn’t paid. I just feel guilty for even considering not working towards a job in this economy - But being taken advantage of is not cool either. 

What would you do in this scenario?"
How to choose a career?,"Hi. I'm 25 years old and have never known what I want to do. I completed a course in IT back in 2016 but haven't been motivated to do anything with it since.

I've been working in a restaurant for the past few years and I do somewhat enjoy it, but its not something I want to be doing for much longer as I hate the anti-social working hours, the pay is only just above minimum wage and there's not much in terms of progression.

My parents are always trying to convince me to go back to education but I'm reluctant simply because I don't know what I would do and I don't want to end up wasting a whole load of time and money on something I may not like.

So does anyone on here know of any tips on deciding what to pursue?

Thanks"
Is it in poor taste to leave your current job for an hour to go interview at another job?,"Disclaimer: my current job is a temp job and contracted to end September 30th, so my job hunt is real right now. I just scheduled an in-person interview at an office about 2 miles away from my current office. Of course, it is during business hours. Will my boss understand my request to leave and go interview, or is it still in poor taste/unprofessional? How else can I handle interviews during the workday?"
What to do when you have little passion?,"Title says it all, I really feel like I don't have much passion as in I really don't know what I want to do with my life. I want to be one of those people who ""don't feel like their working"" at work because I love what I do. I just feel depressed most of the time. I literally don't know what I would love to do with my life. I just want to have time for hobbies, spend time with family, and earn a good salary that supports my lifestyle and savings goals. I look at others who were my peers back in junior high and high school and a lot of them have found something. I just hate having no focus because I feel like if I found one goal I could invest all my time and energy into it and it would become possible. But right now I really don't have that. I'm really desperate at this point, I've even shadowed people and researched different paths but always find myself in this position. It's taking a toll and I am really desperate for some guidance. Even if there's some kind of online quiz or something I can do based on personality that will point me into a direction I would love that"
Did changing your career path turn out the way you wanted?,With the lockdown and a lot of thinking about the future I definitely came to the conclusion that I will begin the process of changing my career. So I would love to know from those of you who found the strength to take this step if you are happy for it?
How do I give my two week notice while my supervisor is working from home?,"I currently have a contract role. And because of the COVID-19 pandemic lots of people are working from home. I want to provide a full two week and be as respectful to my manager as possible. He is OOO until Wednesday and I brought a resignation letter today to give to him. 

How do I do this with him remote? (Also he is extremely bad at checking his emails) 

I have no issues with him and was not searching for another job, but one came up shortly after starting here. And that is a full time job not a contract position.

Update: thank you everyone for the advice and support. I sent him a text message asking if we could meet for 15 minutes. He called me. We went over my current projects. Then I told him I was putting in my two weeks. He was understanding. It went well. Then he told me to email him and HR. So I have emailed HR and with him cc’ed a copy of my resignation"
How did you guys decide what you want to be in life? A few days ago was my 22nd birthday and it was a reminder that I still don't know what I want as a career.,"After high school I studied civil engineering for two years and got a technical diploma, but since I was struggling during those two years with my personal life which of course had an impact on my learning, I could not continue in that domain. I switched to english literature for one year but I did not like the quality of teaching in my home country which made me apply abroad. Fast forward two years later, I'm in my second undergrad year of Psychology and Media and communication and I have absolutely no idea what I can do with them or even if they're useful and could grant me a good income."
"People who had a hard time getting full time work after college, what are you doing now?","I went to college around the recession, during the height of the ""just go to college, a degree in anything will open doors"" mindset.


Since it was the recession, companies were not actively recruiting much on campus.  It kind of seemed like an extension of high school since no one had concrete plans for their careers.  Formal internship programs with companies did not seem to be common back then, it was all unpaid crappy internships.  I was doing premed, graduated, and worked very low paying jobs in my field (biochemistry) while applying to med school.



I eventually ended up in software development at a large tech company after doing cloud/data related work.  I was doing this while getting my MS in CS and after getting sick of waiting 9 months to hear yes/no after a med school interview.


Most of my friends from college have similar stories.  We all aimlessly worked years before breaking into a good career path.  Some are currently applying to law school, others got into non-tech work at technology companies.  But we all agree going to college after high school is pointless and we should have worked a few years before college to get a sense for the job market."
"My boss told me there was no growth for me at the company. After putting in my notice, they posted a job position in a position one-rank above me. Advice?","I have worked at this job for almost two years. When I first began my career here, they were incredibly encouraging that I would have career growth and development. Throughout the two years, my boss kept saying they were either going to hire someone alongside me or a manager (for reference, I'm a marketing coordinator. I have no marketing manager. Just a Director of sales, marketing and business development). I was told about six months ago that unless I wanted to move into sales or business development, I would have no career advancement there. Thus, began my job search and found another similar marketing role with a clear growth path.   


After putting in my notice, my boss was very kind and understanding, and said ""Congratulations! I'm sorry we don't have a career path for you.""  Just this morning with a week left in the role, I get a call about someone asking for contact information for the marketing manager job opening. I knew nothing about this and mentioned I didn't, just directed them to apply online. 

&#x200B;

Part of me is hurt, humiliated and angry. I don't want to just walk out and be petty, but I wish I didn't find out like that. Part of me wants to mention all of this in my exit interview and ask our recruiting manager why there wasn't this opportunity for me. Any career advice would be appreciated."
Did I miss my window of getting a “big girl job”?,"I’m a 23 year old who graduated last May with a BA in Comm/PR. During my spring semester of my senior year I applied to as many jobs as I could. My goal was to move out of state. When I graduated in May I didn’t have anything lined up so I continued to spend all my time job searching/applying. Then job market in my town is very scarce when it comes to PR/Marketing agencies, plus like I mentioned, I really wanted to move out of state anyways. 

Eventually it was October and still no luck so I knew I needed some type of income. I ended up landing a job as a counter manager for a makeup brand (basically a glorified retail job) and live at home with my parents. I was still trying to send out applications in the mean time to hopefully land something else. Then corona hit and I’m now on unemployment. 

I am feeling like I lost my chance. Here it is a year after graduation and I’m working basically a retail job (well was before corona). I feel like I don’t have a shot at a “big girl job” because to employers, I graduated college and then went into a retail job. With corona I feel like it’s near impossible because now I’m trying for an even smaller market with all the new 2020 college grads. I’ve been trying to work on things during quarantine to keep my skills up. I was looking to go into a digital marketing/content strategy type of position but I don’t know if I’m too far out of the game to have a chance. 

Is there anything I can do to help better my chances?"
"Should I (25f) take the easy route and study library science, or the exciting, difficult route and try forensic science?","**EDIT: WOW thank you for all your responses, everyone ;\_; I can't reply to all of you but there's some great advice in there. I really appreciate it. <3**

My BA (East Asian Language and Lit) has gotten me nowhere other than high-end retail, and at this point I feel like I need a graduate degree in order to progress. I certainly don't mind going back to school, but I'm not sure what I even want to do.

My top two choices are a) library science or b) forensic science.

Library science makes sense as it gels with my educational background and previous internship experience as a librarian and a teacher. The work would be easy, it'd be cheaper than other degrees, and it would only last two years. It's also an easy program to get into.

The problem is that I just don't... really... want to be a librarian. I don't feel any passion for librarianship. It feels like the easiest, most mundane choice I could possibly make, and I hate that. It would be stable. It would be smart. It would be very boring.

On the other hand, there's forensic science.

Pursuing forensic science wouldn't make sense, but it's my dream career. I am deeply fascinated by everything to do with forensic science and have been since I was a child. I read forensic news and research in my spare time (which I've had a lot of lately). However, it would be a complete 180 from any of the work I've done so far. I didn't take any STEM in college, I have no background in chemistry. Is this even plausible? Is there any way I could catch up??? I'm a quick learner and I absorb information fast; is there somewhere I could start?

These things might not even matter, however, as my choices are limited by my college transcript. To be blunt: it sucks. Nearly everything from freshman to junior year is a total garbage fire with a few Bs thrown in for variety. My main problem was that I was too busy sleeping and staring at walls to go to class; the second problem was the suicidal depression. When I did make it to class, I would sleep at my desk and take notes that were mostly nonsense scrawling.

Eventually I got diagnosed with narcolepsy, took a year off, came back a little more manageable. My senior year is all As. However, a college board probably isn't going to care about any of that. Any respectable program would take one look at my awful GPA and toss my application in the garbage. I also won't have any stellar letters of recommendation from professors, because, well, I was asleep, and a very bad student.

Sorry this is so disorganized. I don't know what to do or where to even begin. Which program should I choose? Should I even try???? Any advice is appreciated."
"Recruiter answer to apology email: ""Can I ask why? ""","I had an interview today at 3 pm but I can't make it to the meeting. So I sent an email to the recruiter, as early as possible around 8 am, that goes exactly like this:  ""

Lack of Confidence during Interview.. Help?,"Hey guys, I’m here to seek for advice. I’m a fresh grad and currently I had been applying for jobs but none of them doesn’t have interest to even call me for a secondary interview. Basically, I suck on interviews. I feel like when I’m being interviewed I crumble and ran out of words to say.   
 

I need advice to overcome this."
Teaching is an extremely difficult job that doesn’t pay well financially or emotionally. Should I leave education and follow my dream of becoming the first lawyer in my family? Or should I fight the good fight and stay in education?,"After battling constant foul language, poor behavior, obscene amounts of cell phone usage during instructional time, and lack of parental support, I’m done...or at least I think I am. I expected to encounter behavioral issues as an educator in a Title 1 high school, what I didn’t expect was the blatant usage of unethical practices to increase or stabilize the graduation rate. I also didn’t expect the open conversations regarding SPED students and the need to pass them along to avoid being held accountable for not having the proper documentation on said students. 

I made the decision to not sign my contract for the upcoming school year and I am now facing a career crisis. Should I take the LSAT this fall and give Law a try or should I continue my attempt at being the change I want to see in education?

Just a little background: I recently finished my 4th year of teaching, 8th year in education. In my 4 years as an educator, 2 of those years were spent at the elementary level and 2 at the high school level. I also worked for an Ed nonprofit for 3 years and earned a masters in education from an Ivy League Ed school between my first two years as a teacher and my last two years. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts, especially those who’ve made this change."
What does an exit interview usually entail?,"
I quit my job a few days ago when a better offer came along. I told my boss about the offer the week before, he tried to counter it, but in the end he wasn’t able to give me the title change and increase in responsibility that I desired. I wrote a letter of notice to him that explained this and gave it to him in person with a verbal explanation also. 

Part of the reason I am quitting is because of my boss. I’ve been unhappy at my job for at least the past year. I was also just bored and wanted to learn more. I had no idea my boss or coworkers even thought I was an asset until I tried to quit and they said that I was the best person they have ever had in that position and didn’t want to lose me. I have been paranoid about being fired the past 2.5 years I’ve been there. My boss seems to only point out what I do wrong and rarely compliments me even when I am working my tail off. He promised me a lot of things that he never followed through with. He said no to most of my ideas and then was upset when I didn’t bring new things to the company. I mainly avoided him because his main form of communication was yelling. Everyone else at the company feels this way about him. That their biggest problem with the company is him. 

I just want to prepare for this exit interview. What do they typically entail? Should I be honest about how his bad communication skills is part of the reason I’m leaving? He is about to retire in a couple of years, so is there even a reason to do this? Everyone knows him in my industry and I want him to remember me positively.

I’m based in the US.

Update: I asked what the exit interview entails and he says that we will just be getting lunch together and discussing gnu reason for leaving the company. No HR involved. Strange, especially because our HR was present when I had to let go of another employee."
How can I address or handle new boss making fun of me on social media?,"Another user recommended I make a separate post for this from another thread I posted in here. Today will be my second day at my new dream career. Yesterday for my first day I didn’t feel so great because I felt the vibe with my new manager was a little off. Last night I was going to add my teammates on social media since everyone is connected in the company and it is encouraged to do so. I saw my manager’s social media page was not private. On her story she took a screenshot of my purse that I brought in yesterday saying, “yuck!!!”

Seeing that my manager is already saying things about me behind my back on day one demotivates me as I am going to be reporting to this person and the trust factor with myself is already declining. I did not add my manager on social media but I did take a screenshot of what she said. I feel awful because this is my dream job but I also do not want to deal with a manager like this if this is what she is capable of just after day one. 

What should I do? I feel bad for throwing in the towel so quick on a great opportunity but I don’t want to be disrespected by my own boss."
(advice from an exec. recruiter) Curious why you aren't being called back after an interview?,"I've worked in recruiting for many years, representing companies ranging from small tech start ups to fortune 25's.  Here are 3 reasons you'd never guess, that are keeping you from being advanced to the next interview.

1)  **You asked lame questions.**  Interviewers learn more about you *NOT* from the way you answer their questions, but from the questions you ask them.  Make them think.  Stump them.  Demonstrate you know everything there is to know about their co & what they do, through the questions you ask.  Make them fall in love with you through a single ?

2)  **You cared more about impressing them than uncovering their greatest need.**  You primped & polished, brought your heavy brag book and card stock resume, but you completely missed the mark on the fact that they are losing sleep because this vacant territory is losing 15k/day because someone's not there hustling.   

3)  **You were all arm and no follow through.**  You sent a canned email ""Dear Interviewer, thank you for your time today.  I look forward to hearing more about the next steps.""  Very, very, very few job seekers understand the critical importance of a proper follow up.  It is just as important as the interview itself.  I've had more clients than I can count, dismiss a candidate for either not following up at all, or sending a lame email.  Make it count.  Every jot & tittle.  

&#x200B;

I hope this helps you guys who are interviewing!  Ask any questions below and I'm happy to answer."
"Former career coach just sent out an promotional email blast using my name, image, and personal struggles with my employer/job and my boss just forwarded it to me and wants to meet. What should I say to him and what should I do next?","To be honest I don’t even know what advice I’m looking for. Just totally freaked out and appalled by the breach of trust.

I worked with this career coach for 3 months and paid quite a bit of money. She regularly sends out emails with ‘client success’ stories and I always assumed they were vetted by former members of her program.

Well without notice she just sent out mine. In Oct I moved departments within the same company because I had been miserable and overworked in my old role. Her public email included a bunch of what I had told her about how many hours I had been working overtime, how I was upset by management, and my desires to move back to my home city.

Well her advertising email was also sent to my skip level. He forwarded it to me for an explanation...I’m currently playing damage control and just generally fucked....Not sure what to say to him or other members of my team in explanation. Also need to figure out how to get the career coach to fix this. Is it worse if I ask them to send a public retraction?"
How does one go about looking for a job while already in a VERY demanding full time position?,"I’m currently paid salary as a media consultant, and am technically always on call, though I usually work M-F 8:00-5:00. Earlier this week, I got a call from a company wanting to set up an interview, but had missed their calls because I couldn’t get away from work. I explained to them via email why I hadn’t answered, and told them what times I’d be available for an interview, which is only ever on my lunch hour. 

They called yesterday during lunch, but I didn’t have a chance to take one, so I think I missed out on this opportunity.

Going forward, how can I arrange interviews while working my job? Calling out sick isn’t usually an option, nor is leaving the office for a few hours.

For context, my job pay’s shit, and I’m looking for a company that treats their employees better. I can do the same job making 20k more than I do, hence the reason for my job search."
Is it ok to ask about salary during an interview?,"I have my first interview coming up (after my initial phone interview) and I’m curious, is it wrong to ask about salary during an interview? I never have. But in this situation, I have a couple of job opportunities and I want to see if it’s comparable to the others. I obviously wouldn’t say that in an interview, but is there a good way to ask or is it best to avoid?"

They are short staffed right now, but it’s not my problem, and they’ve had plenty of time to fix that and haven’t.

I’ve written it all out, but how do I walk into my supervisors office and hand it in? What do I say? Thanks in advance!"
I have had a job that I hate and finally saved enough to change my career but realized I don't have any dreams left... What now?,"Hello everyone. 

So, I came to a place in my life when I realized I must change my career path. I graduated to be a teacher. I always wanted to be one because I love working with teenagers but I could never land a job because in my country this job is considered fancy (believe it or not) and you need to be a member of a political party, pay a certain amount of money ( basically bribe a principal) or have a strong connection and friendship to land such a job. I had none of those so I had to go and find another job. That is how I started working as a customer support and stayed at that job for 7 years (not in the same company though) because I don't have the luxury to be unemployed amd wait for the perfect job. I am almost 32 now and I literally DESPISE that job. I could never get a promotion because though I avoid conflicts and am helpful towards colleagues, I am also quite introvert and don't know how to 'suck up' to authority figures. However, I did manage to save a good amount of money (I do have other smaller jobs on the side that bring income too) and now I can use that money to follow my dream or go back to school.

The only problem now is that I literally don't know what I want to do. I am not sure I want to teach anymore, well at least not as a full time job. I would like to maybe go back to school and learn new skills but I just cannot figure out what job I would really like to have in the future.

I do like arts for example but I am realistic and I know that I am not very good and that I could never live off of that job. I also thought to start learning program languages at home because I like the idea of creating smth. I am a problem solving person, pretty good with details but then I read how I would have to spend years studying this and praying that someone will give me a job without a bachelour CS degree and I get discouraged. 

Since I am almost 32 I also feel that I really want kids and if I go back to college to earn a CS degree I am afraid I will miss out on having them. Now, I know some people will judge me but, I would really like to be a stay at home mom for a period of several years and use this time to learn a new skill at home or maybe take some evening classes. I actually like staying at home and I love chores. I don't mind cooking or cleaning, doing laundry etc... I even find it relaxing. My husband is a good and caring person but the problem is that he cannot aford to have me at home since he does not earn that much.

However, I have taken the plunge and quit the idea of having a customer support job ever in my life because I literally cannot take it anymore. My husband supports me in this idea because he wants me to have a job that makes me happy. Now I am living off of him and my savings while contemplating what to do next but can't figure it out. 

Has anyone had this issue, have you successfully transitioned careers and how did you move from this 'status quo'?"

"What's the best way to say: ""I can't start working here until I put in my two week notice at my current job""?","I don't know why I'm struggling with how to ""professionally"" word this in an email. But basically, I have a part time job right now, and have been seeking full time employment elsewhere while I've been working here.

I applied at this small startup company, and received an email basically right after my first interview with them (the same day) saying they'd love for me to join the team and they want to fit me into a training week next week. They are aware I have a part time job right now and that I have been planning to quit as soon as I found a full time opportunity. I just don't want to be a jerk and not give my current job the 2-week notice that is common courtesy, especially because I know the department I was hired for is understaffed already.

But I also don't want to miss my opportunity with this startup company because quite frankly it pays a lot more, it's fully remote, and I can more or less make my own hours with the option to work OT if I want.

So how can I say this while expressing my interest in the offer?"
How do you survive the 9-5 grind?,"A bit about me and my situation: I’m a 41 year old female with a unique and creative job that I enjoy but there are downsides too: lots of multitasking, boss is awesome but disorganized, we’re understaffed so it can be stressful, and I sit all day which is bad for my already messed up back. But the biggest downside is my commute (1 hour each way on 3 different crowded and unreliable trains in NYC and no car). One plus is I get a lot of reading done! I would love to work part time there and focus on other creative pursuits but I need my benefits and I’m drowning in student loan debt so I also need reliable income (and lots of it). I just lose so much time in my life and am zapped of energy by the time I get home. So I stay up late to maximize my “me time” (mostly tv or artsy stuff) and then I’m exhausted in the morning. I lack the motivation to exercise or socialize much which I know is bad but I feel so drained all the time. I would love to live closer but it’s not an option right now because my partner’s son is in a great school district. I don’t want to quit (I have great benefits, a lovely work environment, caring employers, and the work is rewarding). Also my job is very niche which means it will be very challenging to find something comparable. But I’m also I’m going crazy and I’m depressed. Any advice? I think we’ll look back on 9-5 work in 100 years and marvel at its cruelty."

"All I feel I care about is escapism, what am I to do?","So there’s no doubting I have depression/anxiety. All the symptoms, and I’ve taken medication for it, so this may be a big thing in factoring how I have the motivation to do stuff.

When I’m at work (IT Support), all I can think about is forms of escapism. Beautiful music, landscapes, cosying up in my blanket playing a game that takes me away (that I just don’t get to do now). As stupid as it sounds, I’d love to land in a career that allows me to marvel at certain things like this. I love games (maybe a game journalist, developer, etc). I love nature (maybe a marine biologist...).

This sounds so stupid and naive but I am a lost soul, it’s getting progressively worse and it’s destroying my entire wellbeing. Everything I do to escape is saddled with guilt that I should be concentrating escaping my job and trying to do something towards enjoying my day to day life, then I may feel like I shouldn’t have to try and escape so much."

We have a relatively small team that runs our assays and a supervisor that organizes the design. He’s also new—right out a PhD program, but I believe he’s worked in biotech before. He’s been working here about 7 months. 
Everyone else works really well together. I really like my colleagues and can rely on them to be efficient, capable, and communicative. Because the company is so small, this is really crucial to things going right. 
However, my supervisor seems to have alienated the rest of my coworkers with generally sloppy work that results in everything having to be redone many times over. This has been costing the company a lot of money and the CEO has steadily been getting more and more frustrated with him. Aside from this, he personally is difficult to get along with, tending to be passive aggressive and often pushing responsibilities onto others. Admittedly, I felt sort of bad for him receiving a fair amount of hostility, so I tried to work with him and tell his what I needed, but it’s mostly resulted in me cleaning up his messes and working significantly more hours because of it.

Earlier today, I put in a written complaint (along with another coworker) outlining this, as well as specific dates and times things went wrong, emphasizing that I find everyone else reliable and wonderful to work with. 

The CEO is apparently “thrilled” about the letter according to HR, noted that it was written in a professional manner, and personally came down to thank me for submitting the letter and ominously suggested that “things are gonna change around here”.

I think I’m just anxious because I’ve been trying to navigate this stuff for the first time. Would anyone have insight about what that means?


UPDATE: the supervisor was asked to resign today, so I guess I figured out “what that means”."
"I feel like I'm being ""edged out"" of my job by a new employee. Toxicity everywhere. Should I look for new employment?","So long story short, I work at an IT company in the customer service/dispatch department. I had an extremely grueling job in fast food before this one so literally anything would have been better. However, when I first started the glaring problems with the company started to shine through. Mainly the lackluster training to begin with.

The manager at the time was never present, leaving me to deal with a highly abusive senior employee (I'll call her A). She talks smack about everyone through chat and email, reports everything everyone is doing wrong to our bosses, withholds information, the whole bit. She is the literal worst. The definition of a narcissistic psychopath who gets off on hurting others reputation.

Eventually the original boss left and for whatever reason was replaced with someone who has literally no clue about our policies or what we do in our department. He is also never present and micromanages us through email and announces our mistakes in front of everyone. He blatantly ignored my email expressing concern that A was committing slander against me.

I used to have a workload that kept me busy throughout the day, but then the new manager's close friend got hired and started taking over about 80% of my original workload. She also gets away with everything because she is the boss's friend. Never ever gets called out on mistakes. I was then given the important responsibility of managing relationships with one of our most valuable clients. During my 3 month review, I was told I was doing great, and I should have more confidence in myself. (self esteem issues abound due to the negative reinforcement from A)

Then, out of nowhere, said important responsibility was snatched out from under me and given to the previous employee who managed it, due to ""The importance of needing someone more knowledgeable."" My manager stressed that it was nothing against me or my work ethic. I had a hard time believing that. I cried pretty much the entire day. How was I supposed to be knowledgeable about this responsibility if I was barely trained on how to carry it out?

The manager said I had more important responsibilities coming my way and he would be glad to go over them with me, I told him sure, but I never heard from him nor have I received any additional work (besides closing work orders, which is incredibly simple)..

Long story short I am working at about 20% of my original workload. I feel undervalued and unappreciated. I fear of having my hours cut due to this, And I have expensive rent and a car payment. I need advice on what to do. Thanks."
Is Linkedin Absolutely Necessary for Networking?,"Hi Redditors

I'm one of the stubborn few that still believes in the Good ol' days and i'm finding it very difficult to conform to the whole social media thing.  Don't get me wrong, i think social media is great and that it has its merits, but honestly, sometimes i could care less about what my ""friends"" had for dinner, vacations, MLM recruiting efforts, and charities begging for everything under the sun.  With that said, i have quit social media and i'm blissfully unaware of all the drama caused my ""friends"" posts on Facebook.

Not long ago, i started talking to a recruiter that was having a career fair in my country, and she sounded very interested on me.  I have been actively looking for a job (reading ads, applying online, requesting meetings, etc.) so for a senior recruiter to be interested on me, that's a big deal.  We chatted both on the phone and by email, made an appointment to meet at the company's career fair, and all went great.  I was told that as soon as the contract got approved, to expect a phone call for a potential opening.  I was also told that if i wanted to know the status of the contract, to follow the recruiter on Linkedin because that is the best most fastest way to contact her.  Problem is, i don't have a linked in account!  I also do not want one.  A few years back, i had started to build my profile on it but 2 seconds after it went ""live"" i got contacted by my ex which absolutely freaked me out.  It was then and there that i decided to forget about the whole linked thing, and i instantly deleted my account.  

So my question to you wise Redditors is:  Do i absolutely need to create an account in order to get recruiters to look at me and the experience i have to offer?   Am i screwed by not wanting to put my stuff out there?  I sincerely appreciate your honest advice."
"I am close to hitting 1.5 years of graduating college and not doing anything related to my degree. Currently, I'm in a dead end job. Where do I go from here?","The past 1.5 year I've been applying to jobs and I've got offers but they are customer service oriented, so I rejected them.  

My BA is in Statistics (embarrassingly) but I was never into my major so I wasted those four years during college not really learning anything. 

I'm not sure if I should force myself to learn stats again from scratch if I'm not really into it (just okay, mer, whatever).

Right now I'm planning to take a community college course in the next week unrelated to stats but I'm not sure if it's a waste of time."
Found out I’m pregnant before my 90 days is up. Now what?,"So I started this amazing job that I truly love, especially after leaving the hell hole I was previously working at. Well, as per custom in most US companies, I’m on a 90 day “probation “ period. About 3 weeks after starting I found out I’m pregnant. I don’t need health insurance or anything like that but I do want to keep my job. Right now because I’m still in my first trimester, my job is not affected. But it will be in a few weeks as I lift heavy things and I’m on my feet 7-8hrs a day. There is talk that I will be promoted to a brand new position in the company so this also makes me take pause in telling them. This new position is ideal because it’s behind a desk anyway, but I’m afraid if I say something before I get it, I won’t. I should throw in that the work is mostly seasonal, so while I would have a job full time, the busy season wouldn’t start for a couple months after the baby is born anyway. If all goes well with the pregnancy the timing is perfect. 

Thanks for reading and if anyone has advice I’d appreciate it.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your input. I knew what I needed to do, but for some reason couldn’t convince myself of it. I am going to wait an see. My 90 days is up in October so here’s hoping I don’t spill the beans. 
I do feel like I should clarify a few things. 
First...We will not eat if I don’t work, so as much as I’d like to be a SAHM it’s not an option. 
Second, I don’t feel like I’m in danger of being let go any minute, otherwise they wouldn’t be considering me for this new position. However, due to the fact that I have to work, I feel like I should have some sense of my options. 
Third, the company I now work for is a permanent job, not a temp. I know others have clarified, but some don’t seem to read the comments so I feel like that needed to be said.  I love my job and bosses, but I also don’t know them well. I staying optimistic but cautious."
"Received offer from 2nd choice employer, have an interview with 1st choice tomorrow. How do I approach this?","
I got a job offer today, and they need an answer by Monday. I have a 2nd interview tomorrow with a job I like more. Except this interview, they said wasn’t really an interview, but they want me to speak with other managers so they can “get to know me” and that it was informal. Sounds like they are trying to see if I’m a personality fit.

Should I let them know at the end of our conversation tomorrow that I have another offer? Or should I email the hiring manager and let her know before the interview?"
Career change for an extreme introvert who's tired of programming?,"What the title says. i've been a web developer for years. I've worked through the fall of the cubicle and the rise of the open office. Every day I have to kowtow around an anxiety attack. The workplace is not a bunch of quiet nerds like I was lead to believe my whole life but a bunch of gregarious men going through mid life crises. I'm sick of the company telling us ""we're a family"" and I'm even more sick of the people who actually believe that HR drivel.

How do I learn Office Politics/Optics skills as a beginner?,"*crosspost from r/IWantToLearn*

I'm a very naive, trusting, and optimistic person. People who know me know that I'm incredibly honest, open, & authentic - sometimes to a fault. However, I find myself in situations where I end up ""losing"" in political, business, or legal situations. I am striving to not communicate in a way that gives away my motives or make emotionally transparent decisions, but I struggle with seeing how my actions will be interpreted by others.

In short, I completely lack the intuitive thinking of how to be selective with my actions for my ultimate benefit.

IWTL what kind of mindset the politically savvy have to achieve what they want, and knowing how your actions may appear to those at work, or in any ""emotionally removed"" environment (legal cases, general politics, business, etc.) I approach every scenario playing the hand I'm dealt, but I've observed a lot of people play the PERSON they're playing with in a natural and charismatic way (and not let their duplicity or manipulation be apparent).

Any suggestions on resources/books/etc. that can help me shift my thinking a bit?"
"28F , recovering addict , 3 time felon...What can I realistically do with my life?","Hey guys , 

&#x200B;

Informative title , I know. I'm a pretty transparent type of person and don't mind being open and honest about the experiences I've had in my life so far. I apologize if this is long but truly appreciate anyone that takes the time to read. 

I'm a female , 28 years old , born and raised in the US , and have a long history of drug abuse. I've been sober for 4 1/2 years which will probably always be the best decision I've ever made in my life. I started using at age 10 , dropped out of high school at the end of my junior year and continued my destructive path until I was 24 when I got sober. In between all of that , I caught endless amount of drug charges , went through rehab and jail countless times , lost my father suddenly 2 weeks before my 23rd birthday and dealt with ( still do) a very broken family. Needless to say , a career was the last thing I was ever thinking about through these times. I managed to gain 3 felonies on my record ( all a direct result of my addiction ). Possession charges and a receiving stolen property charge ( I used my ID to sell something that was obviously stolen) During my years of active addiction I had pretty common jobs ; waiting tables  , selling glasses at a kiosk in the mall , telemarketing. Hated them all. When I got sober , a friend of mine was a crew leader for a construction maintenance cleaning company and got me a job. The hours were long , exhausting and my boss was a very opinionated woman who I somehow really got a long with but didn't always agree with the way she handled some business. After about 90 days at that job , I got promoted to Crew supervisor and had my own crew of about 6-8 people to run everyday. I didn't necessarily love the supervisor part of it all , but I did like delegating tasks. I also love manual labor. After about 2 years I left that job for a behavioral health tech position working in a drug and alcohol treatment facility.   I really thought at that time that this was what I wanted to do. I wanted to eventually get my GED and go back to school to become an addiction counselor. What ended up happening was me being taken advantage of at that company and made to run psycho educational groups every single day with no schooling behind me and only having a little over 2 years sober. I got burnt out , and I got burnt out quick. I became extremely checked out and ended up making a very impulsive decision ( which I don't regret but have absolutely learned to never do again) and quit my job without anything else lined up. The stress of the job fell off my shoulders but then the stress of life and careers jumped right on. I was jobless for the first 3 months of 2018 and finally found a job through a friend in the 12 step program I was in doing Underwriting for a Loan company. I had no idea what any of it entailed and was extremely nervous because not only do I hate numbers of any kind , but i'm horrible at math. Anyway , I'm still currently with this company and although there's no part of it that I really do enjoy ,and sitting at a desk all day is driving me nuts ,  I would never abruptly leave like I did the last one. It's a very flexible job , my commute is 10 minutes and my boss is extremely understanding when I need time off. Nonetheless , it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I recently , about 2 months ago , obtained my GED and now am trying to navigate what I want to do with my life. 

&#x200B;

I feel lost in the sense of never really having that chance to figure it out when I was a teenager because I was getting high. I have felonies now , although they are all about 8 years old at this point. I don't want to waste my time going to college for a degree and I ultimately won't be able to get a job doing because of my past. I also hear horror stories of people going into extreme debt for a degree that they can't even get a job for. I'm not willing to do that. I've been trying to do some research about trade schools but I also don't know if my body can handle doing that for the rest of my life. I had surgery on my ankles when I was a baby & have always had issues with being on my feet for long periods of time. I love cleaning and organizing and attempted starting up my own business but it fizzled out for the most part and i'm just not sure I want to own a business. 

&#x200B;

This is a lot and all over the place but it's a pretty good idea of how my brain functions on a daily basis. I'm not getting any younger and I can't help but feel like i'm running out of time. 

&#x200B;

Thank you to anyone that responds or takes the time to read!"
"I'm a manager and I don't know why but working for just profit feels wrong, can you help me out?","I have tried to conceptualize wtf is wrong with my situation, but I don't really know. I think at the core of it is that as a manager I am consistently told I should be doing what brings the most profit for the business, but yet I feel like sometimes doing what is most profitable is also being a dick to my employees. Exploiting them as much as possible is the most profitable for the company.

I feel like my boss is not a person who seeks to pay people for the work they put in. He seeks to avoid giving raises as long as possible until his hand is forced, which is shitty because its basically him trying to exploit you as much as possible for as cheap of pay as possible EVEN when he recognizes value.

So my problem is two fold:

1. My perspective makes me feel like my boss relatively takes advantage of labor surplus to exploit workers for pay. We are being paid way less than him yet take on nearly just as much stress for our work. He takes trips to europe constantly.

2. The system of competing companies encourages us to under pay everyone in order to have the most future investment. Future value at the cost of current people and their happiness in their lives. How is that fair to the people of today?

I'm being pressured to ask for a higher quality of work from my employees when I already think they are underpaid and that they won't get raises even if they do more. How can I sit there and tell them to do more when they already seem underpaid to me? Hell minimum wage buys so little. The thing is, capitalism seems to be a big game of who can skeet their workers hardest. On the one hand, my current owner of the company I manage for makes too much and does too little. Frankly it is not good for a company to overpay anyone because long term profits go down from a lack of investment. How is it that every company can underpay all of their employees and that be whats best? 

Like these kinds of things don't even make sense to me in a moral sense. How can it be moral for us all to be underpaid? I'm just so confused when I think about business. How is it that my employees lives blow and yet I am still being asked to ask more of them?? Someone please explain that too me. I sit in my room trying to conceptualize it all and it feels like every time I think about it I'm just getting lost. Like I cant even sort it all out because none of it makes any sense. Why is our society this way?? If my workers are being underpaid in my opinion, yet globally others are willing to do the work for less, than I need to be getting more out of them. Yet they are already miserable. I am asking them to be more miserable. It is miserable.

How is it that my boss can take home a big fat stack of cash and that be fair? I just don't get it. How can bezos be paid 100000 per hour and it be fair? His work could not POSSIBLY be THAT stressful. Talent is being made happy and yet we are claiming that by paying talent it is intrinsically worth it to us. It's worth it to overpay Bezos because we get our value back? How could that be possible?

I can't even freaking figure out if my employees are overpaid or underpaid because they are miserable and life sucks on minimum wage in the US, yet people across the globe are willing to do their job for drastically less because they have never known better. It just makes no sense. How can my employees be broke nearly 24/7 and yet I need to be asking them to do more work than what they are doing?

I want to help people. I don't want to live a happier life than anyone else, but I don't know how to evaluate what is fair I guess. I have noticed how if you give people an inch they take a mile. They always accept handouts because many are not in it to be fair, they are in it for themselves. They don't give back when someone is too generous. But in order for me to not be too generous, I need to be putting a dollar amount on their work and idk how in my workplace because I dont think the work is worth it for the pay, but apparently it is? It's just I get confused. I'm trying to get fight some sort of unfairness I seem to perceive in the world and the people who have so little but I can't pinpoint what the unfairness is exactly. It seems like the market is supposed to accurately pay people right? Its like...is there even something to be done? If so what?"
"I'd like to work in a field where I have high levels of autonomy and a flexible schedule. I majored in business but I feel that I haven't learned hard skills that can allow me to achieve that.

Should I make a LinkedIn post about my acceptance into a big city gallery (&link to it)... even if my work in it is technically NSFW?,"Looking for advice on a potential LinkedIn post

I’m trying to post more on LinkedIn. Recently, my photography work got accepted into a gallery in a big city in my state—a big deal for me. Because of the current COVID-19 situation, the gallery ended up being online. I wanted to make a post on LinkedIn about it, but the catch is that my photo is technically NSFW (you can see a very very small portion of an areola in it of my female model). There are other photos in the gallery that are also technically NSFW, but it’s kind of the nature of the beast aka it happens in art a lot. Neither my photo nor the other ones I have seen are sexual in nature. 
I’ve shown my boss and my coworker the photo and they thought it was amazing, they weren’t offended by it. But then again, for context, photography is my hobby, it’s also not directly my day job. I’m a tech writer, and I sometimes photograph products, but that’s it when it comes to my pro photography work. On the flip side, I was in a previous gallery before for my photography work, and that previous gallery I did post about on LinkedIn. 

Anyways, should I post about this on LinkedIn with the link to the gallery? Or do I skip this one out and just reference that I was featured in it on my page somewhere."
How normal is it to attract one enemy in every work place you go?,"It never fails, every work place I go, I attract 1-2 people that dislike me. They say there’s always someone that will dislike you. I say 1-2 because that’s how many people that make it evident to me, there may be more I am not sure. I’m quiet and to myself, I don’t go out of my way to please people and make a great impression. I used to and that still led in being treated like crap. There are those that seem well liked and happy, I’ve never been so fortunate. Am I just unlucky and it’s by chance I encounter tension? Or am I unrealistic and this is common? I’m 25 and this is my first real job in higher education."
Is this the strangest first day ever?,"Hi,
I need some perspective on this situation. Thanks in advance!

I started a new job literally yesterday and here's what's up so far-
I accepted a remote job as a project manager after a very quick interview process (one week from call to offer and over Xmas week) interview process all over the phone. Post acceptance, the tell me they need me to start ASAP and push my start a week sooner than I offered (they pushed for even a week sooner but I was oot) so I've just started. 
In my preinterview on-boarding they tell me that they'd like me to come to the corporate headquarters outside of Chicago for a couple of days- all fine so far.

I get this email from the admin assistant like  'you'll fly in take a bus from the airport and stay in our corporate apartment for your trip'- ok weird that they don't use a hotel and not keen on an hour bus ride but still not worried just yet. 
Next email from my new boss telling me what flight to book on their corporate website. We are going to be meeting at the airport and commuting together and also staying in this same corporate apartment together. No car. Same space (thank God we have our own rooms and bathrooms within the space).  Ok- starting to get anxious.

Im still just rolling with it on Sunday. I met her at her gate (for the first time I've ever seen her) at O'Hare and she's like 'we've got 15 mins to catch the bus are you ok with running?' We ran across O'Hare to catch this bus with minutes to spare. She talks to me nearly the whole bus ride -some pleasantries and some asking me about my previous role. We get off the bus catch an Uber to the shared apartment. It's late at this point- there's no food in this 'stocked apartment' besides beer and oatmeal. We order food (she paid). I ate and went to bed exhausted from the day and the non-stop talking. I went up to my room to go to sleep. 
Monday- Woke up and got ready. We left this apartment and got an Uber to Starbucks for breakfast. We went to the office where we had a small conference room where we spent nearly every minute of the day together- we even took bathroom breaks together (how fun!).  
We do a bit of onboarding and starting process review and she gets visibly annoyed when I ask questions about process flow (learning it's her way or no way) and she tells me it's not my job to worry about the controls that I've always worried about in my previous roles. They are doing their own waterfall/agile hybrid process  I don't know anything more than the customer facing info on this product and she's really not inclined to expound- not your job- stay in your lane. I explain that it helps me understand what I'm doing if I understand the process and she shoots me down again. She said I need to take 'big steps back'. Whatever. I can be a talking head- dropped it..

So she leaves for a bit to have a meeting with her boss and comes back and starts pinging and calling her pms (this starts at about 3 Central) that they need to report numbers before EOD for some budget report. They don't respond she starts calling people. I'm trying to read SharePoint stuff because effectively my training is now over and I'm just another person in the room. About 5pm she's still working and says she be working late. She was weird about giving me a key to get into the apartment. Then pinged some other out of town people who were in the office to have me go dine with them- I didn't ask for her to do this. After some talking my way out of their group I was able to leave and get an Uber to a different place where for the first time I was alone in 24 hours. 
She texted me while I was at the restaurant to check in... Literally left the office at 530 and this check in was at 7. I decided to leave the restaurant because apparently I'm being babysat and came back to the apartment around 8-830. She's on the phone with her boss like 'she finally came home'.  She is sitting in our living room space (no TV's in any other space) working and is still literally calling people who will be my peers to send her data. I sit on the couch across from her and she said she got a 'weird vibe' from me and asked what was up.... (...l) 

She said she had concerns about me (in my life have never been an employee to have concerns about)- I explained that because of my experience my default is to monitor and control my teams work... AND this is DAY ONE. She's at this point still calling her employees, my peers to get them to send her different reports and such. She said to someone as I was in the room 'would you bet your job on that report' ?  Tells me she is often on the phone with her boss at midnight and 2 am. I mentioned work life balance and said I I don't really sync or look at work after I'm done for they day and she responded with 'so after 6 I'll just have to call your personal cell, right?'

 She presssed on the vibe thing - I said I had concerns about calling employees (literally one was on her way ooo and she was asking her to stop her commute to get her information) and felt this situation was strange - and from my experience this seems to be a process issue- either her employees aren't reporting properly or the data collection is flawed and then stepped back and said it was my first day and I only have a very limited view or her budget crisis situation and went to bed.

Would this all be not so bad if I wasn't trapped in a random apartment and had a hotel room where I could come and go as I wanted without feeling under a microscope? Is this just a really dumb situation? I reached out to my friends about it and one said I should be running away and the other said to collect my paycheck and do whatever they want. I will be leaving this office Wednesday and will be working remotely after...
It's 5 am, I can't sleep because this awful situation and even worse this stupid uncomfortable bed. Really starting to feel like this is all by design and they are trying to break me.(would that even be a surprise anymore? Lol) 

Sorry for the length. Looking forward to your thoughts. Thank you again!"
Job searching for 10 months and not getting anything?,"I'm currently stuck in a job that's ruining my physical and mental health. My colleagues have grown to dislike me and they've always looked down on me because I'm 30 years younger than all of them. I desperately want out because I don't fit in. They're all older and still mentally live in the 1950's, meaning since I'm a female in my late 20's, I'm expected to clean up after the older people and take pride in being a secretary. It's absolutely miserable. I get no benefits, pay is low, and my commute is horrendous at over an hour every single day on the city bus.

I've been applying to jobs since the beginning of the year and can't get calls back from anything other than more dead end jobs. I've applied to some out of desperation but realized I shouldn't take them. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business and I do freelance journalism work, I have good internships and other work experience. I'm no ""newbie"" to the workforce, but I constantly feel like I am since I can't land anything more than dead end secretary work.

I want a creative job like in writing or film production (my Business degree focused on the Entertainment industry) but it's impossible to go out and meet people since I'm extremely burned out from my current job. The job is so boring that I can't stay awake, and I've become irritable, but I've never treated any of my colleagues badly. I get home and I'm mentally done. I can eat and watch a couple youtube videos, then I'm done. But I still stay up too late because I don't want to go to sleep, knowing I'll be getting up to go back to this horrible job. I've been severely sleep deprived since last year.

I applied for a job at a bank literally across the street from where I live and I hope I get it. While I don't want to do banking, at least it will get me out of where I am and it's steps away from where I live so there's no commute. There's nothing in my city that I want to do and I've been trying to network online and do freelance work online. I would almost have to move out of where I am, but it's impossible since I can't get a job that pays enough for me to move. I feel like I'm stuck in a never ending cycle of misery.

I don't know what to do when most jobs here are dead end and I'm not getting anything more than pathetic secretary work, and I know I'm worth a lot more than that for the rest of my life."

I work for a financial advisory company and today my boss came around and said its now mandatory that he follow everyone on social media to ""make sure we arent promoting *company name* on our personal accounts"".

I keep my personal and work life as separate as possible? 

Is this actually a new rule? Is this allowed in general in any work place? I've searched for SEC compliance rules specifically about social media and everything that comes up is just about the businesses social media platforms.. not the individual employees?

Also, if there is a better sub to post this on, can you please direct me there? I'm not sure the best place to ask this.

Thank you in advance!!!

Update: first I want to thank everyone that has weighed in here. Mostly everyone has been really helpful and helped me figure out this place is probably not for me. Hes always been a little bit on the inappropriate side and this just pushed me over the edge I think... I'm going to keep my eyes open to new positions in the area.

 I decided if he persists on this issue I'll deactivate my Facebook and tell him I deleted my snapchat. I think it's easier to hide a snapchat than a Facebook because you need the actual snap username and mine isnt recognizable as being me. Also I'd deactivate my facebook rather than change my name or block him because I have a really really uniquely spelled name and theres like 2 profiles that come up when you search for me (my own and one I had in mide school lol) 

I've not accepted any of his requests and have not added him on anything, it's almost the end of the work day and he hasn't come to me about it or sent any emails through the office asking. I'll give it a few days and if he asks for my snapchat I'll let him know it's been deleted. Aside from snapchat I only have Facebook and LinkedIn. When I first started at the office he tried to friend request me on Facebook and I declined it so now he cant add me and I cant add him. 
A random coworker sent me a friend request minutes after my boss came into my office and asked for my social media information. Idk if that's relevant but I figured I'd make it part of the update. 
I'll let you guys know if anything changes!"
Has anyone got told they are not good enough at a company and then become successful at another company doing the same/similar role?,Please share your stories 
"We're being taken advantage of at work, what should we do?","I've worked at a company that's been going downhill for the last few years. It was a toxic work environment, and there was a lack of work even before this ongoing economic crisis happened. I was laid off a few weeks ago, and ended up receiving much more through unemployment due to the recent CARES act than I ever did working full-time. **A few weeks ago, I recieved a call from an HR assistant sounding like they were reading a script:**

""Hi is this (name)? I'm calling from (company name) to let you know you're rehired. 

We've had problems with others not answering us, so we called from a separate number to increase the chances you'd pick up. You are unable to reject an offer of employment without losing your benefits. If your performance is unsatisfactory during the time we're rehiring you, you will be fired, and you'll receive no benefits.

We've received a loan which is contingent on rehiring our old staff. We acknowledge most you are now making more money from unemployment, but we won't be matching it. We want to inform you that the loan only covers the next few months, and we'll likely have to lay you off again when the loan runs out, so please make necessary arrangements. Unfortunately, this would also be when the additional unemployment benefits from the CARES Act goes away, so you wouldn't be receiving any extra money than either unless new laws are passed."" 

Everyone is upset about this, the feeling is that we were tricked into working for a worse version of unemployment, and we have no leverage. Our supervisor continues to talk about bringing *more* people back, despite the lack of work. It's not a tradeoff of financial aid for job security for most people, and I've been extremely stressed.

Do you have any advice for me, or suggestions on what you'd do in this situation?"
"Hiring managers, I am extremely confused about who to hire in this situation, what would you do?","I need to hire someone ASAP for my team at this pretty big company but I won’t state the name. I’m looking for someone who’s fairly experienced at IT and content. 

When I received the CVs, one girl really stood out to me. It was very genuine, no management bullshit and was honest. But she doesn’t have the experience I was looking for. I gave her the opportunity to do a task related to the work and she did very very well especially considering she has very little experience in this field. 

I invited her for an interview and she was such an open person. Her personality was refreshing and she showed so much enthusiasm. She kept repeating how much of ah interest she has in this field and how eager she is to learn etc, she mentioned she’s easy to mould. I was really impressed with her attitude. 

However this role is meant for someone with more experience. You need to be technical and she doesn’t have the experience. No doubt she’d definitely put in the effort it takes to learn but, yeah. That’s my pickle. 

I’ve got a bunch of other candidates who didn’t stand out as much in the interviews but definitely have the experience i need and a lot of them are internal already meaning I feel like I owe them more, and then I have this one girl I can’t stop thinking about because of how just enthusiastic and refreshing she was. I genuinely think she’d fit in the team so well but again she lacks experience and knowledge so she’d need training. 

I need to do what’s best for the team here. Please give me any advice you can. I don’t know if to chose A) a young woman who’s eager to learn, easy to mould and apparently very good at learning new systems and working on a pc or B) someone who can come in with all the experience and knowledge I’m looking for and who’s actually already in the company so they’re internal. 

What is the best decision? This is one of the hardest decisions to make atm."
What LEGIT jobs/careers allow you to work remotely?,"This has been my dream for years, but most of what I find is either some BS transcription contract that pays nowhere near a living, or things that require a degree.

"Working as a pharmacy tech scraping by at $35,000/year, where do I go from here?","So, where do I go from here?

I currently make $35,000 per year as a pharmacy technician. It’s not a lot, but it’s enough to survive. I don’t know where to go from here though, if I ever want to do more than just scrape by. 

I’ve got a minor disability that would prevent me from working in the trades, so that’s out. And last time I was in university, the stress got so bad, I attempted to kill myself. And my situation hasn’t really changed any since then - I’ll still have to work full-time+ while going to school. So, if anyone is able to point me in any direction that may be helpful, I’d appreciate it. Or if my best option is just to try and deal with it and handle school, well, that may just be what I have to do."
HR issued then rescinded a disciplinary notice to me bc they failed to read the dr note I submitted months ago; how protected am I? should I be looking for another job?,"I really thought this company was going to be a long term company for me. I'm working an entry level position but just started classes to move up in the company (a promotion requires more education). I even applied for tuition reimbursement for the classes I'm taking.


I have multiple health issues and checked 'yes' on the ""Do you have a disability?"" question when I was applying for this job. I've been working there for over a year. I was sick for two weeks last year due to smoke inhalation because our area had severe wildfires. I was then placed on a PIP for attendance and told that if my absences were due to medical reasons, I could submit a doctor's note for intermittent medical leave and my attendance would no longer be considered a performance issue. However, I didn't have health insurance until January, so I did not get a doctor's note until a few months ago. I submitted the doctor's note at the same time that I took 4 days of continuous medical leave and the doctor signed one note for both leaves.


Important to note that my manager who was handling the PIP transferred to a different location after I submitted the doctor's note. My supervisor was then promoted to take my manager's place. I had an annual performance review with my supervisor after she got promoted to manager. It was a positive review and I was given a raise. I mentioned the doctor's note at this time and my new manager said she had not yet been made aware of it. I thought that was odd but assumed they were going to fill her in since she had only just been promoted. 

Then in July, a friend of mine died very unexpectedly. Stress exacerbates my health conditions and I missed 1.5 days, then another day for her wake. The lead manager at my office was aware of my friend's passing as well as a few other people I had to tell when I called out. 

The next week, I had a meeting with my manager, my brand new supervisor, and a woman from HR who was running the meeting. They placed a disciplinary notice in front of me which I barely had time to read but it had 3 dates listed on it, dating back to my first attendance warning. 

I said I had a doctor's note on file for intermittent absences and that I was under the impression that was all that was necessary to satisfy the PIP I had been on. HR said I only had the note for the continuous leave I took, and I told her it was on the same note. When she found it, she confirmed that it was on there and swiftly yanked the disciplinary notice away from me. She then chastised me for ""not keeping my managers in the loop"" and also stated that she didn't know if they could accommodate me based on the leave my doctor recommended. She said she would follow up on the issue.

Since this has happened, my motivation to work has substantially dropped. I was putting in extra hours, volunteering to work shifts that needed coverage, and working on my school work to move up in this company. Now I feel that my head is on the chopping block and they are looking for any excuse to fire me, even the death of a friend. I'm stressed all the time, it's affecting my sleep and my health, it's affecting my job performance, and I'm terrified of calling out. I have one more month before I finish my class and am eligible for the tuition reimbursement that I applied for from the company. I'm trying to stick it out until then at least, but I'm wondering if my intuition is correct and I need to give up on this company and look for a job someplace else. And what happens if they say they can't accommodate my medical needs?

Thanks for listening!"

Unhappy with my degree | How to move out of copywriting / advertising ?,"I’m about to turn 26 and I’m tired of feeling unmotivated and directionless.

I studied advertising and journalism with plans to be a copywriter, and I realized it’s not the path for me. I worked really hard in my classes, interned at a major ad agency, pulled all nighters for my school’s ad competition, and read every copywriting book I could get my hands on. By the time I graduated in 2016, I had no desire to work in the industry. I’ve been trying to figure things out since. I’ve jumped around from different jobs and plans, and now I’m unemployed and living at home. I’ve become pretty depressed because I always took pride in my drive.

I don’t want to rant *too* much about what I dislike about copywriting because I’m trying to move forward. I learned a lot about myself in college, became more introverted, and I don’t feel like I value anything about the ad industry. For example: I don’t care about trends / social media / ads in general. I value people who are genuine and don’t like the culture of selling and people pleasing. I tried to suck it up because I know this is a privileged ‘problem’ to have, but it’s hard to pretend, especially in an industry where there are so many passionate people trying to break in.

Anyways, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions on what I could do next and how I can use my time now. I consider myself a creative, but I’ve developed a lot of non-work related hobbies and passions and don’t feel the need for my job to be that ‘cool.’ I think some variety would be nice, though. I’m hoping to find something with decent pay and more stability than the more creative routes I’ve considered (freelance writing, photography, etc).

Some background info and ideas:

* Since graduating: I worked at a restaurant while getting an ESL certification and student teaching, but my plans to teach abroad fell through. Then I worked as a writer at a very tiny marketing firm for a year and a half. I moved to NY and have lived off of temp agency work and sporadic freelance writing and photo assisting. I was interested in learning about becoming a photographer (I’ve had some photos published in magazines), but ultimately there isn’t enough stability and too heavy of a barrier of entry for me.
* I feel ‘unmotivated,’ but there are a lot of things I am interested in (work and non-work related). I’m really interested in people/ethnography, language, visuals / art / design / clothes, psychology, music, and nature / conservation. Obviously no job will encompass all of these things, but it’s a start.
* This isn’t a priority, but I’d like to be in a less conservative work environment if possible. I am a photographer and artist and like a lot of esoteric music and film. It would be great to not feel like I’m hiding at work.
* I’ve got job ideas related to my interests but most of them don’t seem that viable, especially now. I care about money and stability more than I did before, and I’d rather pursue freelance writing and photo projects outside of work.
* I’ve been interested in and looking into tech / coding related jobs, but I feel like this has become a go-to for people not knowing what they want to do. Is this worth looking into? Is it realistic to start learning now and find a job soon?
* I've been working on side projects to keep some motivation. I'm working on a website / social account with a friend right now highlighting style and aesthetics in jazz. I'm working on a long-term photo project, making playlists and a fake ""radio station,"" and hoping to take some drawing and French classes for fun.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. I need to figure something out soon since I lose my health insurance in the next couple months, but I’m trying to break this pattern of lulling around. Any ideas, suggestions, reality checks, etc are welcome!

TLDR: Majored in advertising and it doesn’t fit my personality or values. Out of school for four years jumping around and am now unemployed. What can I do next?"
"Sounds like a joke, but isn't-- Ever since I turned 13 I have had constant gas. To top it off, I have a condition that causes me to have chronic bad breath even if I remove tonsils. I have avoided work due to this. Am I as un-hireable as I feel?","I hate being around people due to knowing I'm burdening them with my chronic gas and bad breath combo, so even though I have extroverted desires, I have become short-worded and avoidant for the sake of other people's comfort.

&#x200B;

Having tried many diets and having visited gastroenterologists who gave me tests and said there's no physical cure (though they did give me pills which did not work, and I've also tried many OTC solutions), I don't think I can fix the gas part-- and even if I did, the other condition causes me to smell very bad anyway (bad breath no matter what. not tonsils-related).

Peers and my own family have constantly informed me of myself/my breath reeking, and steps I've taken to try to fix it have all failed. I feel like a walking cloud of grossness. I don't want to torture anyone by, like, being in a cubicle next to them or sitting next to them at a work meeting. I've already had the experience of sitting in class and having kids cover their noses by me, gossip about my smell (really), and request to change their nearby assigned seats over time like a game of Musical Chairs.

Long story short, because of this, I've basically- entirely withdrawn myself from society. I live alone and have not bothered to pursue a career due to this problem. Outcast by smell! What should I do. Am I wrong to not try? At one point I considered applying for disability, but I don't think my case qualifies, and when I talked to a therapist about this I felt very silly. 

Thanks for listening; would never talk this long to someone IRL! ;)"
I got a bachelor’s degree just so I can get paid $11 an hour?,"I just need to tell someone how I’m feeling. I left my shitty job where I was getting paid $600/biweekly about two weeks ago and have been job searching since then. I keep seeing jobs with requirements of a bachelor degree and only jobs that pay $10-$11 an hour. I have yet to find one that pays more than that. I feel so upset. So mad at myself for going to college and getting in debt. For what? For nothing? I should’ve majored in engineering or something useful. Not sociology or Spanish. And no, I don’t want to be a teacher. I don’t like kids and just left my job of two years where I was a classroom assistant.

The biggest career transition in all of history?,"Hi Career folks,

I just watched an interview on post Covid19 world and the expert they had on made a statement which perked me up. 

He stated that 'when things recover, many people had time to think about what they want to do - many people will decide not to return to what they were doing before. This is going to be the biggest career transition in all of history'.

I am somewhat doubtful with this statement, however it does apply to my situation. I have been planning and working towards a career change well before covid situation. Now I am even in more hurry to move into a different field.

What are your thoughts? Do you foresee many people jumping ship? are you planning to returning to your old post if still available?

What should I study in colleage if I want to own a company which builds and sells sex toys?,"It would be BDSM theamed. Besides regular things like whips, nipple clamps, fuck machines, gloves, leather suits, butt plugs, harnesses for dildos etc I have ideas for new ones. Like discrete BDSM sex toys jewerly etc. 

The problem is for now I only have ideas and zero skills. For my personality it better fits to do the marketing, reaserch what customers want and give ideas what to build. I don't really have the desire to build it myself.

My question is: what should I study in colleage? In my country it is free, so no problems with debt or anything. Just with conservative parents :). Of course I haven't told them my plans, but I know they would disapprove.

Should I go the engineering route or business school? I am capable of learning both, but business and economics is a better fit for me.

I am a rookie, so advice no matter how basic is welcomed. Cheers!"
How can I be so driven at work but so lazy in my personal life?,"I have been crushing it at work (raise after raise along with a huge promotion), but can't help but notice how lazy I am in my personal life.

I will have to give a month notice period - I fear they will take it personally as im leaving them in a bad place but I have been looking for a while.

I guess I’m just looking for the right words to say when I tell them."
New hire is making more than me. How should I address this with my boss professionally?,"I just found out that the new hire is making $2.00 more per hour than I am. I'm trying to understand why she was offered more than me given she has little to no experience in the industry. I was given the task of training her and I have gone above and beyond to ensure she has the knowledge to succeed in her role. Last week we were discussing vacation time and I was explaining to her that 40 hours of it is accrued, but she insisted that her offer states differently. She pulled up her offer letter on her phone and shows me where it talks about vacation time and right about it is her salary. I couldn't not look, it was right there! Of course, I didn't say anything, but I was screaming on the inside!! 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How can someone I'm training for the same role be making more than I am? I came to this company 7 months ago with over 2 years of experience in the industry, extensive knowledge of the market, and a college degree. I was recognized with multiple awards at my old company and had a proven track record of succeeding in my role. Now she's here with no experience and no college degree and making more than me. (Side note: according to my manager, her resume had a few years of experience in our industry. But clearly that isn't true because I have had to explain very basic concepts to her. Someone with any kind of experience would already be very familiar with essential, basic concepts.) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I talked to my manager and asked her for a raise. Her response was to set up a meeting with the regional manager and discuss it with her. She also told me that its probably not in the budget and usually you don't qualify for a raise until you've been employed with the company 1 year. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I set up a meeting with the regional manager for this Thursday. How can i approach this situation with her professionally, but also letting her know that I feel extremely undervalued? Should I quit if my request is denied?"
"Old employer is stuffing Glassdoor, making fake LinkedIn profiles, but is becoming an influencer. Can I do anything?","Very long story short, I worked for this company for 6 months about 4 years ago. They're a dumpster fire, so I left as soon as I found another opportunity in the same city. While I never felt unsafe, it's a genuinely horrible place to work, so I did my best to let people know that – left a truthful one-star review on Glassdoor and steered anyone who asked clear of them.

&#x200B;

They unsuccessfully tried to have my GD review removed (and a coworker got a legal notice of defamation about her review, lol) so I occasionally check up on their page to make sure it's still up. The profile is just brimming with fake, vague, five-star reviews. You know the type. I report them all and reached out to Glassdoor's customer service team to let them know, but I doubt they care.

&#x200B;

This week, I got a LinkedIn connection request and vague intro direct message from someone purporting to work at this company with a very obviously fake profile picture. Reverse image search confirmed it was a stock photo. I called them out in response to the message (just pasted the tineye link) and they immediately changed the picture but didn't respond. I then image-searched their new photo and found it again (they had reversed the stolen image this time). I reported the profile to LinkedIn as fake and hopefully it gets taken down.

&#x200B;

But as the title says, the company and specifically its CEO has a growing thought-leadership presence in legit publications. He's a contributor to Inc and Forbes, which all link back to the company website, and the company has been featured in a local tech pub.

&#x200B;

I know I probably should just let it go, but this place is awful (crazy turnover, missed paychecks, abuse management) and I don't want other young professionals to get hoodwinked and have a bad experience. I'm well beyond the point of ever needing these connections again, so I'm not worried about ""burning a bridge."" I have some pull with the local publication that featured them, but I don't want to make myself look bad by blowing something up that doesn't really affect me.

&#x200B;

As far as I know, they're not breaking the law (just the LI & GD terms of service), but this is super shady spammer-like behavior and I want them to get called out for it, or at least stop doing it. Is reaching out to the local press that featured them or the national publications that feature him a terrible idea? Is a public Twitter thread with screenshots tagging the company just blowing this up unnecessarily and will reflect poorly on me? Anything else could I do?"
So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?,"## So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?

Several years ago, I was having a meeting with a hiring manager at a firm in the city. It was going great...we had really connected, we were telling jokes, etc. It was just a real good conversation. The meeting was winding down and he had asked ""Anything else to add?"" Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a statue of Peter Griffin.Me\- ""I noticed you have a Peter Griffin statue.""Him\- ""Who?""Internal Monologue\- ""Hmmmm....ok, so obviously not a *Family Guy* fan. I should probably just move on.""Me\- ""The statue over there.""Him\- ""Oh, someone bought that for me.""Internal Monologue\- ""I should probably just move on.""Me\- ""Oh I get it! It's because you look like him.""Internal Monologue\- ""Why are you still talking?"" Having a coherent, meaningful conversation is hard enough. But with the pressure of a career involved, successfully interviewing can be darn near impossible. I know what you are thinking\- ""Interviewing is easy...I'm great with people."" Confidence is great, but it will only get you so far. As well as the interview is going, you can just as easily talk yourself right out of the job. Sure, the person interviewing you may be smiling, but you never know if they're just being polite. Official feedback may be\- ""We really liked you and your thought process, but..."" but internal feedback may be\-""I am stupider for having heard that."" Interviews, for the most part, are structured and simple enough to prepare for. Anyone can answer specific and factual questions about their experiences and career. It's easy when there is a format and the candidate is led down a path of responses. But there are two key areas that are difficult for candidates. When you get to these ""open\-ended"" portions of the interview, that's where panic can set in. As a recruiter, the two questions I get most \(other* than How do you sleep at *night? and What is it like to not* have* a soul?\) are

1. How do I answer when I am asked ""Tell me a little about yourself?""
2. What do I say when I am asked ""Do you have any questions?""

Simple right? In theory, these are very easy questions. But the more you think about it, the easier it is to become confused and disoriented, resulting in a panicked mess of silence. Or worse. You could compare the person you are talking to with an overweight buffoon.

## Tell Me A Little About Yourself

Keep in mind, the interviewer isn't asking for your life's story. The key words are ""a little."" But which part should you share? That time in 4th grade that you totally rocked it at Field Day in the tricycle race? I know I know, it shows determination and coolness under pressure. GRIT. Technically this would be better suited for a LinkedIn video recreation. So what IS the interviewer looking for in this answer? They are really just looking to get to know you, your personality, and what details you find relevant to your own life. They want to know your conversation style. Don't overthink it. The more you can relate it to your career, the better. Keep in mind, they really don't want to know ""you"" during this initial meeting. They just want to know ""work you."" The polite, sterile, first impression you. You can dictate the first impression you make. Practice it...don't just wing it. Remember\- there are technically no ""wrong"" ways to answer this question. Keep it short, keep it sweet, and keep it RELEVANT. Some examples\-GOOD \- I've lived in this area my whole life. On a personal note I enjoy reading, fishing and traveling with my family. On a professional note, I've been in recruiting for more than 15 years now and it's a passion of mine. I love staying current on the latest techniques by following X, Y, and Z online.BAD\- I do a great impression of a hot dogGOOD\- I spend a lot of time in my craft studio. I fancy myself quite the amateur woodcarver. Sometimes its good to get away, enjoy the quiet, and just focus on the best way to create something. I find that it keeps me refreshed for all of life's challenges and keeps the creative juices flowing.BAD\- \*knocks over water and runs away\* Also, confidence is great. But you don't want to come off as arrogant. For example\-Interviewer\- I just love a good cup of Starbucks. You like Starbucks Adam? I love a nice venti soy blonde latte. What's your drink of choice?Me\- I like a large coffee.Interviewer\- You mean venti.Me\- No, *Venti* is 20. Large is large. Infact, Tall is large, Gra*nde i*s Spanish for large. Venti is Italian. It's the only one that doesn't mea*n l*arge. Congratulations, you're stupid in 3 languages. Just keep it simple, basic, and most importantly, safe. Who you are, what you are all about, and why your career is what it is. Don't just rehash your experience and your career....talk about how you the person have evolved in the career and what you get out of it.

## Do You Have Any Questions?

The answer is never ""no."" Never. You want to show interest. You want to show that you are thinking long term about the role, the company, your career. A ""no"" shows a limited view of the role. There is zero chance you completely understand everything discussed about the role, the company, etc. When you say ""no"" it usually means\-

1. I just want this to be over because a\) I need to get back to work b\) I need to make the train c\) My meter has been up for 25 minutes and my car may be getting towed right now.
2. I can't hold this bodily function in any longer.
3. I am not a forward thinking person. I didn't hear anything during the interview worth following up on. I am a person of limited imagination and thinking exhausts me.
4. I could care less about this particular job. I just want a job. This job would do. Kindly stop talking and offer me this job. I need money.

### Questions You Should Ask

1. Why is this position open?/What happened to the last person in the role?

6. Based on our conversation today, what parts of my experience do you envision being the biggest assets in this role?
7. Based on our conversation today about my experience, do you anticipate any difficulties of my getting up to speed in this role?
8. What is your estimated timeline for hiring for this role?
9. If I think of any other relevant questions, would you be offended if I reach out? Do you prefer email or call?

By asking these questions, the candidate is able to:

* Exhibit an understanding of what the role entails.
* Understand and demonstrate their experience fits in \(and doesn't\).
* Show they understand the macro impact of this role on the company.
* Show they understand the micro focus of the role as a self\-contained job
* Have a general idea of when the role will be filled.
* Obtain a reason/permission to follow up with the hiring manager.

Having all of that info from the hiring manager at the end of the interview allows the candidate to have the best Thank You letter ever. The candidate can reinforce ""why"" they are a fit for the role. The candidate can address the potential shortcomings the employer has identified. And the best part is, they have some time to think about it to put the best message out there and leave the best impression with the hiring manager. Without asking those questions...when you tell the interviewer ""Nah, I'm good. No questions,"" your follow up letters look like ""Hey, remember that time when I interviewed? That was awesome.""Odds are 1\) It wasn't awesome and 2\) They don't remember."
Can i really get a job if i complete a few courses in data science through udemy/coursera etc without having a bachelors degree?,"I messed around and didnt complete my bachelors, now im 27 years old, with high school education and basic knowledge of IT and a little bit of programming.

Ive really got nothing else to do in my life and if i start investing my time sites mentioned in the title, can i actually land a decent job?

If yes then which courses do you people recommend? Im kinda confused, data science or web development or networking or machine learning?

Ive done some python, but the last thing i did with it was making a save editor for minecraft :P

Thanks in advance."
"Selected after only one interview, and I was told I was their first candidate?","I am a software engineer, and I was recently out of work for about 6 months after I was laid off until I got (and accepted) a job offer last week.  It's a contract position with a fairly well-known company.  I was told by the contracting company that I was their first candidate being interviewed, and I was chosen after just one (video) interview.  Initially they said there would be multiple rounds of interviews, so I was especially surprised to hear I was chosen after just the first interview.  I just started yesterday, but I am still surprised after looking for months and being rejected many times, sometimes after 2 interviews.  Should I feel something might be wrong that I was accepted so quickly?  
I'm not sure if it's imposter syndrome, as I have about 16 years of experience, and I'm sure I can pick up whatever skills I'm less familiar with that I'd need for this position."
What careers could I pursue having lost my only job of 10 years due to deterioration in health?,"I've (M27) worked as a Lithographic Printer for 10 years, so it's the only work experience I have. It always paid fairly well, earning me around £34k annually. I've recently been given a rather delayed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and temporal arteritis, resulting in the deterioration of my joints and eyesight. Given the nature of the work, I've had to leave my position and it's left me in a professional and financial limbo. I'm looking for advice on pursuing a new career, as any attempts so far have been acknowledged but denied due to my lack of experience in any other field of work. I am open to a short stint of education if it will aid my chances of finding something worthwhile. I'm accepting of the fact that I will be taking a significant wage cut for now, and possibly the foreseeable future, but would be hopeful of finding a position in which I could eventually reach a similar salary to my last due to my outgoings being based around that salary. Thanks in advance for any advice."
I am riddled with anxiety every day because I’m scared of getting fired again. What do I do?,"It’s almost all I think about any day. The littlest things will make me anxious. Some back story:

I’m a front end web developer. I live in a medium sized city, about 2 hours from a major US city. I’ve been fired from my last 3 jobs and it has riddled me with anxiety. 

1. When I graduated high school, I got a job at a small agency as a developer. I was their first employee, and at 18 that was a lot to handle because immediately i was made everyone’s “superior” that they hired after me. I managed the sales team and dev team. We hired an intern who’s uncle was extremely wealthy. She had a horrible attitude problem and made working with her not fun. After multiple complaints and attempts to talk to her as well as stress from missing a deadline, I eventually snapped and yelled at her. I didn’t swear at her, just yelled. She was so offended by it she complained to the owner and threatened to quit and I then got “laid off” to “protect the company” from her scary uncle. 

2. I was burnt out from the headache that job was and went into IT. I got a job at a local hospital and got fired for being on my phone too much. What was funny was that I was not on my phone any more than anyone else was, in fact we really didn’t have much to do other than be on our phones, but being 19 for whatever reason I was singled out. I will take the blame on that as I shouldn’t have been on my phone at work.

3. Worked at a fortune 50 company in IT. Worked there for 3 months and was fired. Absolutely no idea why. At that point, I was so scared of getting fired I just simply went into work, did my job, and left. My job was in a call center answering IT phone calls. Everyone I closely worked with liked me, never had an issue with anyone. One day on a Thursday I went in, my badge didn’t work, and all my stuff was in a box. They refused to tell me why and to this day I have no idea why I got fired. 

Today, I moved to this new city and am a developer again. I work at another agency and it’s a good job. I like the people I work with. I want to start my own agency one day and this is a great opportunity for me to learn more about how bigger agencies operate. 

However, this agency is going through some “growing pains”. They’ve fired 4 people in the 2 months I’ve been there including the person I replaced. This is not a good feeling. I get super anxious all the time. All day I am riddled with anxiety. It hasn’t gotten to the point where it effects my performance, but I’m terrified I’m doing something wrong always. If my boss messages me in a weird way I freak out. Today I swear she was acting weird and it had freaked me out. I know they will continually bullshit me and act like it’s fine until they fire me because the girl they fired on Friday didn’t even know it was coming. I’ve made attempts to check in and ask how things are and they say i’m doing great but I don’t believe them. The last 2 jobs I had management said how awesome I was doing and then they fired me days or weeks later. 

This is not healthy but I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep sitting here with this much anxiety because i’m scared to get fired. I don’t have any savings because every time I get fired I have to drain whatever savings I have to not be homeless. I finally have paid down the majority of my credit card debt but the idea of having 0 savings and no other income is scary. I don’t know what to do. This whole firing people is a huge red flag."
I have absolutely no passion for any field. How can I find career for myself?,"I'm almost 23 and the idea of having a successful career is laughable to me. As the title says, I don't have passion for any field whatsoever. I went co college to become a doctor, but I realized I was too stupid to become one and had no chance of getting into medical school so I stopped and now I realize I absolutely hate my biology degree. I'm in grad school currently, but I will be dropping out because I can't stand it.

I have absolutely no skills or talents. I can't see anything positive I have to offer and I'm sure there will ALWAYS be plenty of people better than me for any job position, so there's no chance any reputable place would hire me.

On top of that, I have crippling depression and anxiety. Every single day is a struggle and I'm feeling shittier and shittier as time goes on. I just don't enjoy life and I don't see much of a point in living. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel. You need a lot of money and luck to live a happy life, neither of which I have or ever will have, so I will always be miserable.

How could I possibly ever have a career?"
Furloughed for 3 months then fired for performance issues. What to do next?,"I was furloughed due to the pandemic slowing down business back in April. When I was furloughed I was specifically told that this what not due to performance issues; that it was simply a business decision, and they were going to fight for me to get back to work as soon as possible. This furlough was not supposed to last past July. Recently I finally get notified of a meeting to discuss ending the furlough, and I'm told that I am being let go due to performance related issues, when I left on a good note, and have not even been working!

Come to find out, while I was gone my boss threw me under the bus, and told everyone that certain projects were not done on time due to having to redo my work. When in reality I had been in constant communication with my manager about the status of these projects, and repeatedly asked for meetings to discuss advancing the projects to the next stages which were then postponed. Not to mention we had been forced to work a reduced hour work week, all the while of transitioning to work from home.

I had been told throughout my time with the company that my hard work was appreciated, and been praised for a job well done. It is very upsetting to me that I was not even given the dignity of a lay off. 

But the reason for my post...
Is there any recommendations someone can provide on what to do next? 

I just feel blind sided/betrayed, and I'm just trying to figure out where to go from here.

Any feedback is appreciated, thank you."
Have you ever used LinkedIn profile updates to passively signal you your employer/manager that you may be looking?,"I am currently seeking a promotion that I feel strongly that I am meeting the criteria for, and has been dangled in front of me for the past year. I have a feeling that they think I will not leave due to them paying for most of my MBA and since I have spent my entire 5 year career here, so they continue to give me the “almost there” pitch for promotion. I plan to start applying for new opportunities in the next two weeks and plan to make LinkedIn updates as well. I have read that I should make them private to not notify your network, but wonder if anyone has used this as a passive way to notify that you may be looking and gain a bit of leverage?  
I feel fairly safe in my role due to the niche nature and learning curve associated with it, but wonder what thoughts are in terms of positives and negatives of this approach.

Thanks!"
Am I wasting my potential working as a mechanic?,"I was identified as a gifted kid. I am highly literate, and earned a bachelor of arts. . . 

and then fell out of the white collar world entirely. I dislike desk jobs. I have farmed, and worked in construction, and now finally at age 39 got a job that pays a decent wage as a maintenance mechanic.

The job is really interesting and I like it. But I am the only mechanic at the plant who can also draft a comprehensible email. Or read a book. 

I am an OK mechanic. But I can't escape this feeling like I should be aiming higher or doing something \*more\*. 

I dunno. I am overjoyed to finally have benefits and a pension, which is more than a lot of people can ask for, but I just have this nagging feeling like my imagination is bigger!

Thanks for reading."
How much of yourself should you put into your career?,My job takes a lot of my energy - when I get home I typically have none left. Needing to reset a bit. How much of your energy do you put into your career on a 100% scale? 100% being your maximum energy for the day.
How do you handle a snarky petty coworker when you sit three feet from each other?,"I have a coworker who is always making snarky comments. Today I let my group know I would be in late this morning. I came in at 10:30.  Our manager was having a closed door meeting with two other managers. I said to my coworker, 'haha those meetings always make me paranoid."" She said, ""they should since you come in at 10:30 today with your unannounced appointment.""

We have completely different jobs in our department. Whether I am here or not has no affect on her. I find it very rude when people comment on how you use your PTO.  She is the type who never takes lunches, has no work friends because she is extremely competitive etc. How do you handle this type of person? We have to sit RIGHT next to each other."
Do you tolerate raised voices or yelling?,"This is a throwaway. I am a seasoned programmer with 15+ years of experience in the tech industry. I recently took a job at a small startup and one of the company founders routinely likes to raise his voice or just yell when he is unhappy with a person and lately some of this has been directed at myself. I have never in my entire career came across this behavior and I don't even know how to process it.  


Is this a red line for you and would you just quit on the spot or how have you handled this in the past if it has happened to you?"
"Been working in the videogame industry for 10 years. I'm 30 years old and I am now sick and tired of it. How do I get out? What non-gaming, possibly non-programming, jobs can I get into?","I'm a 30 years old male from Europe. I've been working as a videogame programmer in the last 10 years. I've started out as a junior, then I moved to senior, then I moved to lead programmer. I've changed 4 companies in total, and I've worked on mobile, on PC/Mac and on Console games.

I'm now completely sick and tired of it. I don't like the direction in which the game industry is going. I don't like most of the modern games. I dislike the ""gamer community"" (whatever that means), and I absolutely despise the ""gamedev community"". Especially indie developers: can't stand being around them anymore. But also AAA developers are insufferable. I've worked in 3 different European countries and the situation is the same. On top of that, add the fact that I'm having your typical 30-year-old crisis in which I feel like I'm doing nothing meaningful for humanity and for the world.

I do enjoy programming, but I'd rather have a managerial job, in which I send emails, file spreadsheets and run meetings all day. I'd especially enjoy the idea to work in politics-related fields, but I wouldn't know where to start, and I only know people in the game industry. I don't even know how hard it is to land a politic-related job. Is it a pipe-dream hob, or is it doable?

I feel like I'm pretty flexible and open to anything, as long as it has a good salary **or** good growth possibilities. What other fields should I look into?

**Please keep in mind that I have no college degree, and don't have the money/time to take one.** Also, I'm ok with relocating anywhere in the world with short notice.

Please help.

How to deal with feeling stupid?,"So im in the process of training at a new job and in an new field ive never worked in before. Because of the pandemic and some loss of business i havent been able to come in and get consistent hands on trainingm so far fornthe last 3 months ive only had 5 or 6 days where ive come in and done 4 to 5 hours of hands on training for tasks. Then ive been off for two weeks straight because they couldnt schedule me. Anyways, im still making mistakes and the environment isnt a warm place for new people who need to ask a lot of questions. I can tell as soon as i leave the room or clock out forbthe day in being talked about. Its all women so it doesnt really vother me honestly. I expect it. But its frustrating going through this same process while training where by not knowong something you feel stupid. Im pretty sure my boss thinks I'm retarded.

Whats the best move on how to deal with this. Should i be asking my boss how she thinks I'm doing or things she sees in struggling with? Its been communicated that the covid situation has messed up the opportunity to train more hours. But still I feel the pressure to get and remember things right a way and if I dont I'm not competent.

Appreciate any advice and experiences."
"Should I negotiate for $2,000 dollars more a year?","I just interviewed for a government contractor job. The location, nature of the work, and benefits are all right up my alley. Before even interviewing for the role, the job announcement clearly stated a salary band of 56-58k a year. I managed to get a first, second, and third interview. Things went well in the interview, I am praying that an offer comes in soon. If they produce an offer, should I ask for the high end of the salary range.

I know I'm not willing to walk away from the opportunity, but given how expensive my area is, I feel like I should at least try to get more. When I negotiate, should I raise them to 60k/61k or something like that and ask if we can meet in the middle? Or should I just ask for the straight 58K? Given that it's a federal contracting company, my instincts tell me they have a very rigid pay structure and that they truly would not be able to go above 58k. Also, do most offers still come in like an email form? It's been awhile since I've switched jobs and I think the last time, I got an email and a phone call. Is there like a negotiating cheat sheet someone can refer me to? Sorry I'm a neub haha, but I never ask for more money and this time, I want to try at least.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Should I try to bargain for just 2k more a year? 

Edit: Thank you all for your responses! The recruiter sent me forms today from the employer and one of the questions asked what my salary expectations were so I wrote, “negotiable.” Wish me luck!"
What can I do to become a data analyst?," I took some stats classes in college but did not major in stats. Also, I did not understand it fully when I took them and I have forgotten most things we did in those classes. Can I still be a data analyst? I love looking and playing with data but my skills would be classified as poor."
"A recruiter lectured me regarding my handling of my interview, and then extended an offer; should I still accept?","I recently began applying to jobs (I’m in marketing) because my current job has become stagnant and I felt it was time for a change. I am still employed, and intend to quit upon accepting an offer elsewhere. 

Over the span of a couple months and about 20 applications I finally heard from a company. The business is a large company based in my city with locations all over the US and Canada. They wanted to get me on the phone ASAP for a screening with the company recruiter. That went well and I was scheduled for a phone interview with the hiring manager. This also went very well. The call was originally scheduled for 30 minutes, but continued for about an hour. The next day I heard back from the recruiter that they wanted to schedule an in-person interview.

I was told what time to arrive for the interview and was told to “plan for an hour or little bit longer”. I showed up right on time and the interview began promptly. I nailed every question and from what I could tell, they were very impressed with my experience and potential. It was all smiles and good vibes from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. I never once looked at the clock because the conversation was fast paced and smooth. When I left I looked at the clock in the car and it turns out the interview lasted just shy of 2 hours.

The next morning (this morning) I received a call from the recruiter with good news. They were extending an offer to me! Naturally I was ecstatic, but the recruiter quickly turned the conversation to an issue that had come up in my interviews. She told me the hiring manager expressed to the recruiter that I went over on time during both of my interviews, and that if I wanted to work at this company I would need to “nip that in the bud” because this company takes meeting schedules very seriously. She went on to give a light lecture about time management and learning to read the room.

I was completely caught off guard. Generally speaking I think I’m pretty good at room reading and receiving social cues. I was also taught for years that it can often be a good thing when an interview goes over its allotted time since that usually means they like what they’re hearing. I’ll remind you that the room was all smiles and good vibes. They spent about 3/4 of the time asking me specific experience related questions, and left the remaining time to allow me to ask them questions of my own. 

This whole thing is making me think about what kind of culture this business might have. They lectured me before I even worked for them. It’s made me seriously consider not accepting the offer. 

Am I over reacting? Is this normal? I’ve worked in a professional environment for years so I know how to operate and communicate in an situation like this. Should I reject the offer and wait for a different opportunity? I’m not in a rush, but I look forward to leaving my current job."
Can you ever be satisfied in a job if you’re not very career driven?,"I’m employed now, but my job is so emotionally draining and unmotivating that I’ve wanted to quit for at least a year. I’ve been actively applying, but I’m not sure which route to go because my skill set is varied and I’m also only 2 years out of college. I’ve never envisioned myself in a particular job, so I’m feeling a little lost. 

My skill set and interests are all over. I’ve done copy writing, video, social media, photography, email marketing, HTML. It seems like my only option is something in marketing, but that’s where I am now and can’t stand it. 

I’m not sure what I really want to do either because I’m not very career driven. I’ve never pictured myself climbing the corporate ladder or understood the undying dedication some people have for their careers and companies that can drop you in a heartbeat. I just work for a paycheck, I have no passion for my work at all and find more satisfaction in my hobbies and side projects, which involve art and photography. But I also don’t want to turn a hobby into a career because I don’t want to grow to hate it. 

I’m feeling lost on what to do, but I don’t want to hate going to work everyday."
"Hi Reddit friends, Please can you be the pushy workaholic dad that I never had and didn’t want but in retrospect absolutely needed?","Hi Reddit! 26 year old guy here in desperate need of wise worldly people for some mentoring and guidance!

**Quick break down of my situation:**

My only goal after graduating university was to travel. I grew up quite poor and so never travelled or had a passport as a kid, so seeing the world was my absolute number one priority.
Since then I’ve lived in New Zealand, California, Vietnam and Cambodia and paid for it all myself doing basic retail and hospitality jobs, mostly for charities. It’s been wonderful and nice but now I’m back in England and suddenly faced with the reality of being pretty much unemployable for anything other than the most basic of work, and it’s a bit depressing going for with 16 year olds of minimum wage jobs. I totally accept it as the price I’ve paid for travelling for so long, but I’d like to get going on a real career as soon as possible! 

**(You can probably skip this next bit but slightly more info if you’d like it and I thought it was kinda well written):**


My parents are a bit like sims that you’ve maxed out on the ‘kind nurturing and dependable’ stats and totally dumped the ‘successful career advice’ ones, which is great for making me not a serial killer but totally unhelpful in terms of being any help in my current situation. The world of professional employment seems like it might as well be the moon for how achievable it seems.
At the moment I have the exact same feeling of unbridled terror as I did the first time I tried to cross a road in Hanoi. Fortunately, once I’d got to grips with how Hanoi worked it became my favourite place in the world, and I have no doubt having a professional career and life will end up the same way! I just really need someone to grab my hand and guide me through the 6,000,000 loud beeping scooters of confusion between me and the questionable street food vendor that in this terrible metaphor represents my career.


I’m working part time in a vegan wholefoods co-operative at the moment which is a nice work environment and allows a lot of freedom with when and how much I work, but I’m definitely ready to start a career and try and get employed somewhere that has long term security and means I’ll be working with adults rather than 16 year olds!


**The actual important bit! (Finally):**

I have an undergraduate degree in Radio production and Technology (Bsc) which is pretty useless so I’ve just been looking into perhaps studying either a conversion course or just going on to do a masters that will make me more employable at something. I’d love no nonsense professional advice on what masters would be achievable with my degree and would equip me to start work in a particular field upon completion.


My degree is a science based degree but it only vaguely touched on coding or anything like that and it was a hell of a long time ago, but I wouldn’t be adverse to studying that more! My only real concern at the moment is I don’t want to waste more time. I don’t want to study a masters/conversion course that just puts me back in this position in 1 or 2 years time!


Becoming a teacher is definitely an option that is up for consideration, but I know it’s arrogant to think I could just ‘fall into’ teaching as a back up option, so any advice from teachers who have maybe been in my situation is great too!


**TOO LONG DIDN’T READ AND BECAME INFURIATED:**

What I’m getting at is that I am ready to start my career and quite open about what that career could entail! My only concern is that I want to study/pursue something that will really help and progress my career prospects. My biggest fear is going to study something then end up back at square one after graduating! What can I work towards right this second that will give me genuine prospects and options in 2 years time?

I just want to make sure I’m on the path to somewhere as opposed to wasting time getting older and I have nobody in my life to sit me down, tell me I’m a dissapointment and explain the options and the pitfalls in front of me, so you have to be my dad reddit. Get your shit together.

Thanks in advance for anyone who has actually managed to read this far, any input appreciated!"
How do I craft a resume to avoid age/sex-discrimination ?,"We all know its there. 

If I get a foot in the door and an interview I can at least impress with my abilities. I know there is no way to stop from being not offered a position because of team ""fit"".   Being a dumpy middle aged woman with kids ...unless I kill it in the interview I know I am not getting that position.

But I would at least like a shot at proving myself. 

I have never attended an interview, where I haven't been offered a position *till last year. It was a bit of a shock to my system, since the guy that ultimately got the position was less experienced, educated and could have tried to be a better engineer. So I don't know why he was picked.*"
I might land a job that pays significantly more with a lot less work. Is this right to feel I don't deserve it?,"It's a weird question but I'll try to explain. So I work a job right now that pays close to minimum wage, but it's pretty much backbreaking, sweatshop type work. I might get a job that pays a little over four times as much, but it's a cakewalk compared to what I do now. For example, I'll have time to sneak in some YouTube videos as I work or post on Reddit, while I usually have to take Advil after what I do now. Is it wrong to feel like I don't deserve what I will be earning? It honestly feels like I'm cheating, and I have a lot of respect for the type of people I work with."
Constant Job Rejection Feel Like Dating to Anyone Else?,"I graduated into the recession and couldn’t find a job, setting me back a bit in terms of job experience in my (dying) field of journalism. I couldn’t even get an unpaid internship then. Now there’s younger, more hands-on experienced individuals that are in higher demand. I’m so tired of filling out applications, having phone interviews, and multiple face-to-face interviews, only to be passed over. It’s so frustrating. If I wanted this much rejection, I’d get back on Tinder. How do you fellow job-searchers keep your spirits up in the face of constant disappointment?"
Considering leaving my position due solely to not having received a review or an increase - justifiable or petty?,"So I started with this company in July of last year, and my offer was for an agreed starting salary, with a 90 day review. Normally, not having gotten a review by now wouldn’t be that big of a deal, except for the following:

I started on a Monday, and on Friday I was offered another position that was more in line with my background, and told that it would pay better as well. Of course I accepted, and after about 3 weeks I assumed the new role. 

Once in the new position, I was instrumental in literally saving the department from collapse, and it is now more profitable than its ever been. 

I was instrumental in helping collect over $35,000 from a client due to a past connection with them (I’m not in finance or collection, and through my connections was able to clear up some communication issues that got us paid quickly) 

At my 90 day mark, my manager was terminated. This has nothing to do with my specific department as he wore several hats, but it did require my partner and I to work more independently. We now manage our department with minimal supervision. 

I’ve also brought in two successful referrals, who are doing well. I’ve brought in guests to speak with management about opportunities to expand and strategies for making that successful. 

Normally, I wouldn’t be upset over not getting a raise within the first year, but I was told I would get a review, then offered a promotion which I have done a great job with...and no increase in pay... am I wrong for being pissed? I’ve mentioned it a couple times but I’m done beating a dead horse. Is it wrong of me to be looking just because of this? It feels very much like a broken promise, about money as well as recognition. I’m frustrated. Sorry for the rant."
Is the grass always greener?,"I feel like am constantly toying with the “grass is always greener” mentality. I have recently switched jobs thinking it would be better than my last and while some aspects are I miss my old job in a way. However, when I think about my old job and tasks I had to complete I talk myself out of missing it. I am just worried I’ll never find what I am “meant to do” in life/my passion. Thinking more and more that my job will not be my passion but what I do to aide in finding my passion? It’s just tough when you spend majority of your day and life in a job and when you don’t really like it it’s daunting -  it’s an overwhelming feeling. Does anyone deal with this? If so what do you do outside of work to make yourself forget about it until the next day? I’m tired of having the stress of the job consume my life. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!"
I've gotten to the point where I cant figure out what I actually do for a living anymore?,"To help understand how I got to this point, and where my confusion lies: I'm 31F, and I have a trade certificate in Drafting, no degrees because I'm dyslexic (I do want to try again). I also have no experience outside of the company I work for. 

I started in a small company that has grown about eight years ago as an intern, working in the design department and call center.  Over the next few years, I became a drafting and sales assistant. I then focused solely on Drafting. I developed the drawing office around the companies needs. After about 3 years, I found myself in the position of drawing office manager, out of ease more than ability probably. I was allowed to hire a couple of intern draftsmen, and they became so capable that I started to have a crazy amount of free time. 

I started providing illustrations, and renders to our marketing department as they were looking for a freelancer to do this, I taught myself using freeware, without costing the company anything. The technical guides at the time were elementary, so I started creating documents and illustrating them to help sell our products more effectively. The CEO started using me for his own projects, and I started communicating with suppliers and assisting with developing products offshore. I stopped drafting entirely and had to hand over the drawing office to someone else.

After about 5 years in the company, I was promoted to a product manager, and given a specific line of products. The only other person assisting with this was one of the executive's very capable cousins. About 2 years ago, we hired an R&D manager, who happened to be the sister of one of the Executives. We get on like a house on fire, and she had several years of corporate experience, a masters in her field and helped me polish up professionally. She has somehow become my unofficial manager, though none of the higher-ups wants to say it out loud. I'm happy with it, the entire department runs smoothly owing to her.

The problem lies in that we are under-resourced. It's just the cousin, manager and myself as well as a few strategically placed offshore colleagues.  They keep threatening to hire more people but never do. My manager started using me for product design and rapid prototyping owing to my history with drafting skills, adding to my workload. Then she tackled the technical documentation process, and I suddenly became the liaison between our department and marketing, developing these documents. Including outlining the content, writing, illustrating, researching, data collection and sorting. She edits and we have a back and forth over the document until its ready to send to marketing.

So now I'm managing and developing a product line. I'm designing products outside of that product-line, providing technical support and writing as discussed above, and after all that, my pay-slip actually says R&D manager.  The only thing I don't do other than editing is manage budgets, which the CEO does himself.

So what am I? A Product Manager? R&D manager? Or am I really a Product designer? Maybe a Technical writer and illustrator? By trade, I'm a Draftsman. Do they fall under some all encompassing job title. Do Product managers or R&D managers usually do this stuff? 

A job title seems like such a small thing, but I want to go back to university, it is not going to happen with the workload. I also want to renegotiate my salary. Not because I necessarily want more money (which I do!), but because I if they keep getting the milk for free, why buy more cows?  I adore my job, but my current salary is along the lines of a mid-level draftsman, which doesn't reflect my (perceived) value to the company or based on my official job titles, regardless of the qualifications.  Can I even make comparisons given that this all is so dependent on the niche I've created for myself within the company? And the company has done so much for me as well but after 8 years, at what stage do I stop paying it forward to them and start focusing on myself without been ungrateful?  If I could just figure it out.

Thanks."
"My employee offered more to stay than I make, is it time to ask for a raise or a new job?","So I'm in an awkward situation where I'm not sure how to respond. I am a lead engineer and have only one employee working for me who has been there for less than a year. He put in his two weeks notice and I have fought to get him an offer to stay because we are buried in work. The offer hr made him is more than I make by a significant amount. I don't know if they realized that it was more than they are paying me as all the hr is new there.

I have been in my company for 5 years and have really gone above and beyond this past year to make big things happen for them. I have worked weekends, holidays, and vacation days to make all this happen. My division's sales have quadrupled as a direct result of the projects I have done and is growing to upwards of 100 million revenue over the next year. 

The projects I have pulled off were done on a timeline we had never previously achieved in my company and have solidified a new relationships with THE biggest customer in our market. 

I got my lead position in november. The offer was a little under what I told myself I would accept, but I took it anyways because I wanted the management opportunity. Glass door says that I am in the bottom 10th percentile of earners in my area with my job title. 

My company has taken a huge change in direction recently (shortcuts), and we are loosing people right and left because of the highly stressful environment this creates.

What in the world should I do? Ask for a raise? Look for a new job? Hang in there until I have been in my new management position for long enough to get another job like this elsewhere? 

Thanks."
"Mid/late 30s Career change, any interest in this story?","I see a lot of posts on this forum looking for help on how to go about changing career after the reality of an industry hits home, or after spending a long time in an area and feeling trapped, or just a general lack of passion.

I have felt this pain, and I wonder if I can help a bit.

It has been a proud couple of months for me - I both turned 40, and started a fantastic new job that I had been targeting for a very long time, after finding myself unhappy and depressed in a dead end job in a separate industry at 35. I was able to do this without taking a pay cut.

It has been a long, and at times painful journey fraught with difficulty, but is it one that might offer some value to someone out there.

Would anyone be interested in reading such a story?

Edit: Ok I will write it up. Will need to be tomorrow morning though. I would like to do a good job of writing it, and I need some sleep.

**OK here we go:**

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that my experience will not be applicable to everyone. We all have a different situation, and some of the things I describe will not be possible to replicate. That said, it is my hope someone will get something out of it, even if it is just motivation rather than a strategy or practical advice. 

Secondly, I also need to recognise that luck played a part. I would like to believe that some of the luck was created through hard work, but at certain points people did things for me that they really didn’t have to.
I will try and keep it brief, but my story takes place over a long time with lots of twists and turns, so you might want to grab a coffee! Anyway, here goes.


Five years ago, I had painted myself into a career corner. 12 years working in a technical role for large Telecommunication companies left me with a very specific set of skills in a profession I had no passion for. (I don’t want to divulge too much detail about the role, as I don’t want to offend anyone who does it). I had grown very competent at it, but it wasn’t for me. Added to this, the only way “up” was through general management, which held little appeal for me, and in an area where people traditionally retired after doing the same role for 40 years or more, there was also very little opportunity for development or movement.


Anyway, one day I had an epiphany (won’t go into detail), and decided I absolutely must change something, anything.


Trouble is, and I think there are a lot of people in this boat – *I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.*


My first step was to look around for other jobs at the company I worked for, as I figured it was probably practical to make an internal transfer in a company that trusted me, than go in “cold” elsewhere. I had a good relationship with my Line Manager, who was very understanding and supportive. He didn’t want me to leave, but he understood that I was unhappy and that in the long term it would be no good for him or for the team to try and make me stay. I suppose you could say that my first stroke of luck was having a good relationship with an intelligent and supportive Manager. 


We devised a plan. Under the guise of “professional development” in learning about the company, he arranged for me to spend a day with other teams, based on job descriptions I saw on the company Intranet. All had partial skills matches with what I did already, and on paper a role within any of the teams would represent meaningful career progression. I did this about three times, and I certainly learned a lot – about what I didn’t want to do. Here was a lesson learned for me, no matter how amazing a job description sounds, the reality can be much different.


I kept going. Then, a stroke of luck: while this was happening, my team were “treated” to a training course. It was the first piece of official training most of the team had had for nearly a decade, so we were looking forward to it. I was on a specific piece of software we were migrating to, and it was very hard to use. It was so specific in fact, that the trainers had to be flown in from Europe at great expense. 


They “phoned it in” as they say in the US. The trainers were poor, and one of them was offensive and rude, particularly to older members of the team who were having trouble picking up the software. I ended up assisting, as I had used the software extensively before and had an affinity for technology. I managed to defuse the situation, (aforementioned trainer was going to get punched).


Afterwards, I fed back to my manager what I thought of the training (awful). He challenged me to do better. I had some good feedback from the team, and was already mentoring new starters, so I thought – why not? I was convinced I could not do any worse. 


Our contract with the training provider was not renewed, and there was a training gap, so I volunteered to deliver a course. I had no idea really what I was doing, I only resolved to do two things: Ensure everyone learned everything they needed to, and treat everyone in the room with dignity.  


It went brilliantly, and I loved it. It caught me by surprise, I am normally a very quiet and reserved person, so public speaking in front of colleagues should have terrified me, but it didn’t. My parents had warned me off education as a career prospect early on, as they were both teachers and said there was no money in it. In the Public Sector, this was (is?) certainly true. I was determined to do make this work however, and decided to do some research. 

*What if there was some way I could combine something I was good at (technology), with some I actually cared about (education), and not take a pay cut in the process?*


*Technical Training* was what I found, and that is what I do now.


Of course, I was only half way there, I had found a potential career, but I wasn’t actually doing it yet. I applied for some Training Roles, but got no responses. It became evident that I needed the experience. It was at this point I had another knockback, and a blow to my confidence. My Manager set me with a meeting with our HoD. My mission was to convince him that our department needed a full-time trainer, and that I was that person. I was naïve however, and didn’t realise that what I needed was a bulletproof business justification – this was after all, a penny counting operational department. For all intents and purposes, I was laughed out of the room. Awful moment for me.


I didn’t give up. My company was big enough that we had our own training department, and I kept my eyes open for job opportunities there. I wanted nothing left to chance - when an opportunity came up I wanted to be 1st in line. To that end, I volunteered for every training delivery opportunity possible. I dressed professionally so trainees felt they were getting a “paid for” experience (they weren’t). I did my very best to ensure the training was fun and engaging, everyone left the training room armed with what they needed to know, and I made sure they felt 10 feet tall. I created an online community using our corporate intranet, recording and uploaded lots of tutorial videos to it which people found useful. At this point some of my colleagues thought I was a suck-up, but I didn’t care, I was too far invested and had a plan.


I played the long game. It took maybe 6-9 months of this, but my reputation grew. Managers from over the country started asking for me specifically to deliver training, and they negotiated with my Line Manager to free me up from my day job so I could.


Eventually, I got the attention of the training department, and I interviewed for the next available position as a Technical Trainer. They were very impressed with the work I had done on my own, and sought feedback from the people I trained – which (I assume) must have been positive. My strategy had worked, I was the person they wanted!


After the interview process, I was offered the role - at 15% less than my current salary. To train people to do the role that I was currently in. I went from elation to disappointment in a heartbeat. Another awful moment. My Wife and I were saving every penny for a house deposit, and there was no way we could take that kind of income hit. 


Despite all the hard work getting me to this point, I had to tell them no, I could not accept a base salary cut. I needed them to counter. It was a gamble, and one of the most difficult conversations I have ever had.  


It was a calculated gamble though. I was miles ahead of the other candidates, and I deliberately left salary negotiation as late as possible in the process in case they low balled me. I figured, the longer they went without completing the hire, the stronger my negotiating position became. Especially if they made the foolish move of informing the unsuccessful candidates before I formally accepted.


Unbeknown to me, this also paid off. The hiring Manager became desperate, and drove for half a day to the HR Directors Office to convince her that he needed me for the job. He was successful, and had a whole new job band created just for me, so they could pay my current salary.


**Success!!!** Everything up until this point took about 2.5 years.


For the next 2.5 years, I set about learning my new field. My story is already pretty long, but I need to mention that this part was also quite difficult. I enjoyed the work for sure, and was good at it – but going from the guy who knows everything, to the guy who knows nothing was tough. Learning from people 10 years my junior, reporting to people 5 years my junior. It was humbling, even a bit depressing at times.


I did a lot of graft however, learned everything I could, as fast as I could. I had fantastic professional development opportunities too. As a result, I outgrew the role. Now armed with a whole lot of relevant experience in my CV, I recently started a new job, in a new company, in a more senior role and I finally feel like the change has been a success. 


If you have made it this far, you can imagine it was a long road. There is actually a lot I have left out, but this post is already too long, so I’ll just say thank you for reading and if you have any questions I am more than happy to answer.


**TLDR:**

-	Use any research method you can think of to find something that you both have an affinity for, and care about.

-	Find a practical way to go about making a change.

-	Don’t give up when you experience setbacks.

Why you shouldn't spend too much time worrying about your career?,"Today I had a great discussion about choices and decisions. Whether you realize it or not, your life is made up of many choices. What you wear, how you style your hair, what to eat for breakfast, how your going to get to work, what your doing, etc. These choices can be traumatic to some. I know for me, it has been. 

Don't you find it funny that one wrong decision or choice can affect the outcome of your whole day, and it shouldn't be like that. How we ultimately decide what our motives and intents are at every turn and section of the day help to make up our life. Life is just a journey of wrong decisions, right decisions, bad choices, good choices, and missed opportunities. 

I've always wanted to make the right decision. The right decision for me is the one that progresses me, and opens up doors to my future. But the reasons I associate as a right decision are different from how another person might see their ""right decision.""

Life is short, enjoy the ride, and take it for what it is. There's no other way. Trust in your gut, your instinct, and it'll all work out."
Stable job I like ($50k) or risky job I love ($70k)?,"Stable job I **like** ($50k) or risky job I **love** ($72k)?

First, I’m 40.

I’m currently at a **stable job** (technically no job is stable I know), in a position I’m comfortable in, with a boss that likes me and would fight for me (and says he has plans for me with the company), in a company that has been around for 20 years, with decent benefits & flexibility (periodic paid lunches, somewhat flexible schedule, etc), I literally have 0 complaints about this job. Job is even easy too, I don’t see myself ever getting fired and could be there for years to come (won’t love it, but won’t hate it, it's nice, I like it)... It’s stable.

But there’s another **risky job** that pays more ($72k vs $50k) in an industry I’m super passionate about… but there’s risk because it’s a startup company, in an industry where others didn't make it, so it may not be around in 3-5 years.

It’s typically easy for me to make hard decisions, but this one has just got me torn. Everything is pointing to taking the high paying job doing something I love, but the uncertainty of the future is making me 2nd guess myself. And I would hate to burn a bridge with my current employee.

Any advice here? And if it helps, here’s some background about me:

**ASL**: 40/m/Idaho  
**Debt**: $70k left in mortgage, $7k left on car, $7k left in Credit Cards  
**Kids**: No  
**Married**: Yes, she doesn’t work  
**Priorities**: My credit is 500\~ and I desperately need to get it improved asap by paying off my Credit Cards (reasons I won’t bore you with)

Anyway, the wonderful world of Reddit, my first post ever. Professional thoughts on my situation?"
I made a script that tailors my resume to a job position. Am I cheating?,"Hi! I'm rather designer, not a developer but I wrote a script (javascript + PHP) that modifies my resume to any designer/developer position by searching key terms or key phrases in a job description.  I made my resume in JSON structure for fast modification (inserting or deleting skills). I also use parsed job descriptions from Indeed/Jooble to teach my super-easy ML-algorithm (it helps me to search more key phrases and skills from different sources)

So... Am I cheating with recruiters and automated resume checkers? Is it legal? "
"Quit My Full-Time Job For Mental Health. Happy Now, But Not Proud of New Job. Does Anyone Else Feel This Way?","I quit my full-time (dream) job a couple of weeks ago after only 8+ months there. While it was within the publishing field that I had always dreamed of working in, it also came with a lot of stress and it took its toll on my already flaring anxiety and depression. Not to mention the pay was low with very little potential for advancement. 

Cut to the present, I am now working a simple full-time job (not complex in any way) in a vastly different industry with even less pay and no benefits, but...I am so happy! I originally meant to work there part-time but the full-time just kind of landed in my lap. I barely have anything new to learn and my brain has time to relax. I can actually come home with energy! 

Does it suck not having benefits and extra perks? Yeah, but the mental and physical toil I was in forced me to go to the doctor more anyways. 

I think the only aspect that really has me hesitant...is the fact that I'm not really...PROUD of the current job I do. Its not what I pictured for myself and certainly not at this age. Its not a ""young professional"" type of career. And I don't really want to tell anyone about it. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone else feel this way?"
"How do I approach a lead whose ""jokes"" about me messing up/being unproductive are starting to wear on me and make it worse?","Ever since my coworkers and I started working from home about a month ago, I've had a really hard time staying focused. I have been diagnosed with ADHD by several different doctors, but my psychiatrist refuse to medicate or discuss other behavioral options with me because I don't think she believes the diagnosis/thinks I'm just ""on my phone too much""... So I've relied really strongly on the external structure of a workplace environment and co-workers around to keep me focused. Since that doesn't exist anymore, I'm falling apart. I'm making more mistakes, being less productive, pretty much a slew of fireable mistakes if I wasn't working in an industry that doesn't really fire people.

One of the leads I do occasional work for has always needled me, and I could probably write an entirely separate advice post about his other behavior towards me. However lately, he's started making jokes about my mistakes... Saying things like ""you messed up... again? :)"" on a daily basis. I can take a joke, but the same one made every day when I *am* trying to find ways to create structure and stay focused is really wearing on me. 

It's already upsetting to be letting people down constantly, I want to do a good job and it's humiliating. But the jabs are getting to me and obviously making it worse, as I'm posting on Reddit instead of working. How do I get him to stop? (Other than not screwing up...which I'm working on...)"
A former employee of mine is represented herself on her resume using my title and not the title she had. Should I let her current employer know this or let it slide?,"While researching a company I was interviewing with, I discovered that one of my former employees was working there. In her mini bio on the company’s website, it lists job responsibilities for her past job that were actually my responsibilities. When I checked her LinkedIn profile, she lists her job title for the period she worked for me as my title. This led me to wonder if she had misrepresented herself to obtain her current position.

I’m wondering what to do about it. Should I let her employer know about it? I would want to know were I the person who hired her as I would not want someone on my team who misrepresented her credentials to get the job. On the other hand, I’m sympathetic because had she used her own title in her profile, it would list several titles of “manager” followed by “coordinator,” which looks like a step backward. 

I’m leaning toward ignoring it."
Stuck in a job that's ruining my health & job search is hopeless. What do I do now?,"I've been an admin assistant for 4 years now. It was fine at first, but I've been struggling in it for over a year. I'm 26F and educated with a Bachelor's Degree. I've outgrown this job because all I do is copy papers and clean the office. The commute takes an hour even though it's only a few miles (traffic is horrendous). They pay is low and I get no health insurance benefits. I've developed IBS and my depression has gotten worse due to the stress of it all. The long commute, low pay, and disorganized management. My boss always gives me last minute work in the last 15 minutes of the day that needs done immediately. I sit there doing almost nothing all day, even though I ask for work to do they say ""We don't have anything right now"". They wait until the last minute and it's stressing me out so bad. I also can't sleep more than 5 hours a night and it's agonizing.

I've been applying for jobs since January and only got a call back from a receptionist position at a hair salon nearby. It was a joke I applied to it because I figured a crap job would call me back and they did. I've been applying for jobs one step above admin assistant, because I don't want to do this anymore, but I've heard nothing.

I've met with my uni's career department for help and they worked with me. They said my resume and cover letters were great. But they've left it up to me to apply for jobs (I wish they would be recommend me somewhere). Applying online is hopeless and I have no connections.

I still live at home since I have no money to live on my own, so it's financially okay for me to quit the current job and work harder at finding another one, except I pay full price for health insurance. But my parents don't have extra money and consistently need my financial help. We all work together just to keep an apartment and buy food and pay bills, paycheck to paycheck. I write freelance for some websites so I can use that to explain the gap in my employment. I'd like the most to write for a living, but working full time doesn't give me enough free time to pursue it. I've considered part time work, but I will probably need a job that provides health benefits.

I'm scared to quit because I'll lose income to pay for health insurance. I can't afford the penalty at tax season. I'm completely miserable and depressed and hopeless. I have no idea what to do since I'm doing my best and it's not resulting in anything. I don't want to be an assistant forever when I went to university and I'm getting older. It's more of a job suited for someone in college or just out of college, and people have only stayed there for a year and moved on. I've been stuck there and need help getting out."
I've been repeatedly told I'm doomed and hopeless after being out of the workforce for 16 years. Is this really true? [ pls no bully :( I come in total peace and humility ],"Thanks for clicking on my post!

So here's some information for you in case you're willing to point me in some useful directions. Thanks in advance for reading and thinking about a stranger's troubles and foibles.

I have a foreign degree in economics but I don't remember any of the coursework and I'm not good at it anyway. I wasn't good at economic theory and belief systems back then either. Plus I had little to no idea about what to do during exams because the questions made little sense to me. I was far better at understanding business and some finance concepts from a few of the classes I had to take. I grasped them intuitively much better than my classmates who did well at economics.

I haven't worked in 16 years. I'm afraid I will not be getting into the how and why of how this transpired. Please rest assured however that there is no incarceration or any other type of untoward/illegal/immoral/scandalous issue involved whatsoever.

What I have been doing - as and when I could - is taking many for-credit courses online at community colleges and a local 4 year college. I've been taking them as a non-degree seeking student. These classes have been in business and law, as well as in art and design. I have also taken non-college non-credit classes in art. I have excelled at all these classes.

My past jobs, before the 16 year period of unemployment, involved customer service and low-level admin work. I realized that I have a peculiar talent for observation of customer behavior and a strong curiosity about its patterns, going so far as to conduct little sensory experiments to see what customers responded to. I also found myself fixing hold-ups in customer service and employee performance with little basic solutions such as a flow-chart, behind the counter for the cashiers, that described types of glitches that the ancient cash machine would throw at us while checking out a customer and how to work around those glitches. 

Ideally, if I had the money and time that I needed, I would be studying human perception and sensory processing, and applying it toward usability, UI/UX work, interaction design, service design, customer experience design etc. But alas, I do not have that time and/or money :/ I am curious about studying these fields in Germany though given its free education and the quality of German design. But since I have no idea how to get there, it remains a total fantasy at this point.

What I can do as proven by the coursework I've excelled at:

- Write a fairly decent essay

- Analyze a given situation fairly decently

- Grasp legal concepts and apply them to scenarios (while being unable to memorize - please see section below)

- Understand at least fairly well how the fields of business and law work with each other

- Understand visual composition 

- Convey visual information

- Take on complicated topics in business, science and design and find a way to synthesize them and produce a fairly decent design product
 
This semester I will be learning how to write a business plan.

What I CANNOT do:

- Drive

- Stand for longer than 30 minutes. Walking is totally fine.

- Lift heavy objects

- Do math calculations quickly or in my head

- Memorize a ton of stuff and recall it quickly

- Speak Spanish - which in my town at least is a definite requirement for any and all menial jobs and even many white-collar low-level jobs

CAVEATS:

- The law classes have NOT been from any law school and I'm NOT working towards a JD or any paralegal certification. (Should I?) They're from community colleges.

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in design software such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator etc. 

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in commonly used office software like MS Office.

If you've read thus far, here are some questions:

- Ideally I would have a remote/online part-time job.  What fields would such jobs fall under? What skills do such jobs often require?

- What should I learn in the short term so I have basic job skills for a white-collar job? 

(I'm not seeking white-collar out of classism or snobbery, please see 'What I CANNOT do section' above)

- What should I aim for in the long term so that I can build career skills while I work a part-time job?

- What kind of job should I be looking for while I build larger, long-term career skills?

- Do you have any pointers on what type of career I should go for? 

CODING BOOTCAMP:

At this point, it seems like standard advice to tell someone to 'get into' a coding bootcamp. Is this a reasonable course of action for someone like me?

Thank you VERY much for reading thus far! If all you have to say is that I'm doomed and hopeless, I request that you not bother saying it. I look forward to your suggestions and advice. Thanks again."
What kind of well paying jobs exist for introverts?,"I will make this a long story short, I’m a nurse and I hate it. I was extroverted and bubbly when I went in, and four years later I am introverted, mean, hardened, and intolerant. I do not want to be a nurse anymore, but it pays well and I have no idea how to start over, or where I should even begin. I am not always myself because of this job, and it is NOT because of the unit I work on. I just cannot handle patients screaming, whining, and taking everything out on me anymore. I need to get out of this and need some guidance. I’m good at a lot of things, I learn quickly, and I am very fast and efficient. At this point I’m willing to learn anything else. I just do not want to be anywhere near a hospital because hospitals do not give a fuck about their employees.

Offered a job while at new job for a month. What to do?,"I was laid off and out  of work for six months. A job came up that was basically a lateral move and I took it because I needed to be employed. It's not the move I was hoping to make, but had to make.

I've been at this new job a month when I was contacted for an interview at a different company for a position that will put me on a new career path. It's what I've been looking for.  The interview went great and they're sending me an offer. 

Once I accept, what's the best way to tell my employer of one month that I'm quitting? I, of course, feel horrible about the timing and leaving a job so quickly."

I’m a college graduate with 6 years of experience. Why can’t I get hired anywhere?,"I graduated back in May and I’ve been looking for a job ever since. I’ve only worked retail so naturally that was the first place for me to look. I’m under immense pressure from the people around me to get a job and I want a job but I’ve only caught a series of bad breaks since I graduated back in May. One of the companies I thought would hire me, baited and switched me. I saw a manager position I badly wanted and I’ve applied for  all of the similar positions that have popped up and the minimum requirements to become a manager is 2 or more years of college and I have a degree but every single time I apply, I’m sent the generic rejection email. I’m in full out desperation mode. I’ve been applying at so many different places including Walmart but haven’t gotten a call back or I’ve been rejected.  2 weeks ago I went to an interview at the electric company and found out that I’m competing against 6 other applicants and the electric company ghosted me as well. So now I’m in a situation where I’m wanting to be employed and every week seems like I’ll get a break but nothing ends up happening and I don’t get hired. And it doesn’t help that I’m under immense pressure to get a job.  I feel trapped and I’m not sure what to do."

I’m terrified because I really want to apply to a much, MUCH higher salary job than I’m used to, because I’m very money motivated. I am saving to get out of a mentally abusive family situation and I feel like my little $12.30 jobs have made me feel even more stuck in my situation and hopeless. I’m starting to really grow confidence as far as negotiating goes, however, I just don’t know how I’ll navigate this part. I also don’t drive which I know is asked about a lot so I’m terrified of being seen as worth way less than the job and salary I’m asking for because of it."
"I quit, but my job is still scheduling me?","So, I handed in my two weeks notice three weeks ago, and my employer seemed fine with it. She didn’t ask me to stay past the date I stated as my last day or anything, but I’m still being scheduled? I had shifts for this week and next week, but I’m no longer working there. I haven’t showed up to any of them, but I’m not really sure what to do? This was my first job so I haven’t had any experience with this kind of thing before.

Edit: Ok, thank you guys for the advice! I’ve let them know more than once that I don’t work there anymore, so I’m just going to leave it be. Sorry if this question came off as kinda dumb, I’ve just never quit a job before and didn’t know if I’d done something wrong. Thanks again :)"
"Just fired from a job that I've been at for almost a decade. Seeking advice, new career? etc.","Background

I am 32 Years old and have just been fired today.  I was fired for an incident that occurred 7-8 years ago.   This topic is not about why i was fired so i will just leave it at that.

I have been with this company for my entire adult life. Part time while in university, and full time immediately after graduation.  8-9 years working there full time.  You could say its a government job where most people who work there stay for life, and that was my plan as well.

I have a degree in Finance and graduated in 2010,  it was difficult to find work in my field back then, and I had the opportunity to get a decent paying job out of school so I took it.

I started as a cleaner and took a few relevant courses to become a technician/mechanic within the company.  Sadly these courses do not qualify me for anything outside of my previous work. 

Now I am unemployed, and the only education I have is finance degree from a decade ago with zero relevant experience, and some random trade courses my previous employer decided were relevant.  Essentially zero technical qualifications.



**I have no idea what I want to do with my life at this point.**  I am recently married, and we had our first child 2 months ago, so the timing could not have been worse.  But I do have several months to a year worth of funds saved.

I am open to trying anything really, from going back to school, to starting my own business.
My previous work was easy but brain dead and I did not really enjoy my time there, it was just to pay the bills.  
I'm hoping this time around it can be different.


A few things about me.

* I'm a nerd, logical, introvert, somewhat interested in technology, and I play alot of games.

* I am no good at things like cold calling, sales, public speaking, and grammar. 

* I consider myself a fairly capable individual.  And I am confident if given the chance I can excel in whatever position I apply for.  I just need the opportunity 



Some fields I've considered (but know nothing or very little about)

* Gaming related

* IT related job

* Finance related 




Any extra schooling I go for would have to be a relatively short/fast tracked?  As I cannot afford to go back to school for 4 years.


Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, 
for example, the IT field is huge, what sort of courses should I take?  How much money will I make?

Obviously i want to make the most money possible.  For reference I made ~75k at my previous job


Thank you in advance.





EDIT:   Thanks to everyone for all the replies.  I made this post less then 4 hours after getting let go, and did not expect so many replies.

My current plan is to take a couple days to digest everything, and do some research.

I will probably apply to some apprenticeship programs, while in the meantime try some introductory coding courses online to see how I like it."
Had a serious panic attack at work. Is this a good time to jump off?,"Hi all,

I'm 26 (M) and I've been working as an analyst in a bank for 1 and a half years. It's a stressful job, we take a lot of shit from different people. The internal policies are ridiculous, they treat us like children, the work is incredibly tedious and repetitive, and honestly there doesn't seem to be much room for growth (the higher up jobs look unbearable). 

We have about two managers per analyst... And all that the managers do is discuss projects that never happen, fight over the holiday schedule, or convince us that we don't need to get paid for overtime.

I want out, I want to change industries all together. I have about 3 months savings at the moment and I was thinking of sucking it up for a few months while I applied to schools and saved some more.

But I have an anxiety disorder which stems from PTSD. I've kept my anxiety and depression on the down low at work, even though I know that my job enhances my symptoms. I've been muscling through, sometimes it gets really hard and I hide in the bathroom.

Today, while I was chatting with my manager, I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe. Then I felt like I was going to die. I couldn't stand straight. Suddenly there was an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital. They had me there for three hours or so... At the end I just started crying.

Right now I'm at home trying to process what just happened. I'm terrified of going back to work tomorrow. I'm terrified that this might happen again. I don't want to go back. Is this a good time to jump off? Can I say I need to take this time to focus on my mental health and have a look at other options?

(Thanks so much for reading)"
"I'm 21, and I'm making the best money I've ever made... but I don't think I want to do this job forever. What are my options?","I just started working with a commercial roofing company a few months ago at entry-level, and it pays the best I've ever made by far. However, I'm already beginning to feel as though I don't want to stay doing this forever, because I'm beginning to resent the fact that I never know when I'll be home, and I fear that there isn't much room for me to grow because I don't know if I'm ever going to be suited for a position where I am in charge of other people. I'm thinking of going back to school (I finished high school but that's it), partly to seek career growth but also because I feel I am bored and mentally understimulated. I'm not sure what to go back for though, and it's a difficult situation to try and go back because I need to work full time to support myself and my fiancee (her mental health struggles have been a barrier to her working up to this point, I am our sole income). I'd like to have a career that's more intellectually interesting, but I'd like a more stable schedule (roughly 40 hours most weeks, preferably). I have a bit of a STEM background from the advanced program I went through in high school, and think I might be interested in a career in biology or botany, but I am open to other fields of study, and I do enjoy being outdoors, but it seems that any outdoor job tends to have a more unpredictable schedule and/or less pay than I would prefer. What do y'all think, is it worth my while to explore other options, or should I just get over myself and stay where I'm at?

Edit: I'm located in Saukville, WI"
How does one find work they enjoy?,"Ive basically never had a job that i actually felt passionate about. Ive always worked to survive. Tryna figure out what work wont leave me bored and depressed. 

I am realizing that i am creative, & empathetic, and have always tried to push that away. I like helping ppl. I get sick of “selling”. 

What are ur stories? How did you find a great career?"
I recently quit my job in an attempt to reinvent myself but all job offers are related to the industry I left (logistics) which I honestly grew to despise . How can I finally leave it behind?!,"I recently (last day was 2 weeks ago) quit my very well paying Logistics Coordinator job. I have a couple of months of rent saved up , will be starting school next week (video editing and production) at a local community college (very low cost) and already have a part time job lined up at a local restaurant.

However, as happy as I am to be pursuing something I’ve always wanted to do and chase after my dreams. The “logical” side of my brain which chooses the money is going nuts. Mind you, there is no way I will go back to Logistics, I’ve grown to hate the job and the repetitiveness of it. I worked at one of the best logistics companies in the world with great benefits an awesome team and good pay. None of this was enough as I simply no longer had any interest in it. I was basically dragging myself out of bed every morning and had become anxiety ridden and depressed feeling as if I was just slowly rotting in my cubicle.

I am actually excited for the restaurant job even though it will only pay a fraction of my old job because its something different . But I know I want to make more money than I did before. Not to mention, I will need a steady income to buy equipment and build my media company as I grow my skills.

Again, lots of people have asked why I didnt stay at my old job amd went to school at the same time. With 55+ hours of work a week and my hate towards the job it was just not possible. I wanted out . So going back to that is simply not an option . If rather struggle with part times until I find something else than go back to it.

With that said. I am 31 now and have been working since age 17. Ive been a delivery driver, warehouse supervisor, got a BA in Psychology, have some experience in sales and worked as a logistics coordinator for the last 7 years.

Nonetheless, right now I dont have kids a mortgage or any debt. But my savings aren’t huge either just enough to get by for about 4-5 months plus whatever I make on the part time.

Ive looked into e-commerce and drop-shipping since I have extensive experience with imports from Asia and Europe due to my work in logistics. However, that industry really seems like a gamble and I dont have money to spare/throw away in hopes of getting lucky.

I do speak spanish fluently and have no trouble befriended and talking to people so there’s that as well.

Any suggestions/advise is appreciated."
Anyone else interested in everything?,"Hey everyone!

Ever since I can remember I've been a super curious, knowledge-seeking person which I think helped me alot in certain aspects of my life but it makes deciding which courses to take in college and what my career path will look like a nightmare...

For some background, I just turned 20 (today's my birthday!) and I'm currently in my second year of a bachelor's in Computer Science. I chose Computer Science mainly because it would allow me to get a job pretty much anywhere in the world but I don't particularly LOVE it. I'm quite interested in Psychology, Neuroscience, History,  Philosophy but also some Politics and some aspects of engineering. I'm not super extroverted but I'm also not an introvert, I like to be around people and sometimes even talk in public to a lot of people but other times I just wanna be alone for a whole weekend.

I feel like people can rely on me and I would do well on a managerial position but I'm unsure since I don't have any job experience.  I love learning about diferent cultures and how they go about their day, including traditions, ideas, how they view the world etc, so having a job that somehow included that would be amazing (although maybe hard to obtain).

Anyone that has gone through a similar situation? I have never really asked for help before because I always ended up deciding and living with the consequences but this time I want to get it right (or as close as possible anyway).

Thank you so much!!"
"what are the best, free online certification courses?","Hey guys. I was wondering what online courses were the best. Im talking free courses, or courses where you have to pay only for he certification. What is a good career field to go into, with a free online course and certification opportunity? Any help would be much appreciated!

"What is the biggest regret you have, from a career perspective?","I just started working a year ago.

Thanks for the help!"
In a unique position with my current job where I realistically will only work one week every month. What are some other jobs/sources of income I can do with the other three weeks?,"I currently live in Houston and the company I work for is HQ’d in another city. I drive up there two weeks out of the month and work, but I’m transitioning to one week per month by June or July. I manage the software that drives our entire company process along with all of our IT services. I also go on sales calls and manage and train employees.

Now I don’t have any coding experience; I worked for the company that provides our software. I did the implementation for all of their customers. I’m also only in my twenties, so I don’t have very many years of experience.

I was hoping to get some advice on what else I could do with the downtime I have. I really only take a few short calls a week and deal with some software issues here and there."
"I've been stuck in retail for the past three years, how can I get myself out?","I'm in my mid-20s and feel lost career-wise. I graduated a few years back with a liberal arts BA, and found myself totally unemployable as a result. After over a year of looking, I ended up a cashier at an upscale grocery store just to start paying down my loans. I worked my way to a lead cashier position, with the promise of a promotion to assistant manager that has yet to materialize.

I have all the responsibilities of a manager, but I make $13.50/hr and have a completely variable schedule. I'm starting to feel this lifestyle taking its toll on me, and really just want a M-F/9-5 office gig that pays $40-50k a year. I've been looking at job sites, but I feel overwhelmed at all the job titles I've never heard of and all the requirements/experience I don't have. Any advice on a direction I could take would be massively appreciated."
"Does anyone have advice for a 33 year old biology major who spent her 20's traveling, focusing on relationships, and working food service, but who now wants to do more with her life?","Hey Reddit, here's some background: I graduated at the height of the economic recession with a biology degree. I immediately went into academic research for a few years (ecology, botany, and molecular bio/cancer research), but then was laid off due to lack of funding. I decided to take my savings and go to West Africa where I ended up informally teaching science in a local grade school for a year. After that, I had the travel bug and spent the rest of my 20's basically working in food service so I could have funds to travel. I've been to 35 or so countries and did volunteer farming or other odds and ends, but nothing too involved or for too long. I mostly just enjoyed myself. I also spent a lot of time focusing on a few long-term relationships that didn't pan out. My last relationship kept me in the states for several years while I worked at a coffee shop. When it ended, I decided to try something in my field again, and after 6 months of job hunting, ended up in NYC doing environmental education. It's fun, but I am not in love with it.

I am just unsure where to go from here. I am once again job hunting (entry level positions) but to no avail. I feel like my resume screams ""person who lacks focus with an inability to take initiative"" due to my traveling 20's. I feel stuck and like now would be a good time to go back to school or start something different (like teaching yoga or travel nursing), but my interests are more philosophical than practical: science writing/communication (think Michael Pollan), making nature documentaries, ethnobotany, and even consciousness research. Is it worth it at this point to take out more loans to pursue a new career with a possible low ROI? I just really love traveling, thinking, and learning about science and am tired of working seasonal, low-paying fieldwork or food service jobs. I want to start a career of some sort....which I feel I should have done a decade ago and didn't, and am now worried I'm a little too old with too little experience to be taken seriously."
"Why is almost everything I'm interested in and passionate about ""oversaturated""?","I'm not going to go into too many details. I'm 26. Everything that has caught my interest I have discarded or given up on due to it being ""oversaturated"".

Currently really wanting to get into digital marketing, but everyone is saying there's too many and blah blah blah.

Is there a field that is NOT ""oversaturated""? Nurses say it. Lawyers say it. Engineers, teachers, even freakin programmers.

What trades or backup careers can I learn on the weekends or at nights?,"I'm a 25 year old software engineer, and I make good money doing it. However, I want to have some kind of fallback career in case my industry collapses, I get burnt out, or I just decide that I don't want to live near a major metropolitan area anymore.

I wanted to learn something tangible, something where I could work with my hands. Electrician, Plumber, etc. and not something which requires a degree or less hands-on work. Something where there's pretty much always SOME kind of demand for that skill (though I know there's no such thing as an industry invulnerable to recession).

I looked into learning to be an electrician in my area, but it seems impossible to learn and be certified just on the nights or weekends - these things require a pretty much full time commitment through shadowing and apprenticeship.

Are there good trades I can learn and take night or weekend classes at a community college or through a trade school?

Obviously, the ability to actually attend any of these classes is limited by the present medical situation on the planet, but let's just pretend it's 2019 again."
"What kind of jobs can you do from home, not having to interact with people, that pay at least $50,000 a year?","I asked this in the jobs subreddit, and the mod removed it saying “No soliciting”, even though I’m not trying to sell anything, so, I guess I’ll post this here, since it’s essentially the same thing (career=job).

And preferably not require 8 hours a day, or 40 hours a week, but I wouldn’t be unwilling to spend that much time since the benefit would be getting to be at home by myself.

Disclaimer, I’m 24, but a social anomaly, and my family’s abuse and being financially unable to support myself makes me socially withdrawal even more.

I’m kind of relieved school has been moved online (because of the pandemic that mentioning gets people banned and demonetized in the case of YouTubers) because socially, I was getting nowhere.

I’m a college freshman at 24 years old, who sucks at driving (recently failed the test) and completely dependent on my parents to not be homeless. 

I couldn’t even get the pills I require to function on a basic level if it weren’t for being on my parent’s health insurance (I live in the United States, no Universal Healthcare here), which I will be legally forced off when I turn 26. If I lost access I could literally end up another crazy homeless person, and no offense to anyone (I know some really are just down on their luck) but I would rather kill myself than be homeless (also because I’ve already been abused and miserable my whole life)

I suffer from OCD, ADD, and more recently, severe anxiety, depression, and until my psychiatrist added another medication, near-violent rage (I can’t function at all without medication, and I’m still not a functional adult).

I hate my job, but I am very grateful to have it (especially throughout the whole pandemic, because many people have lost their jobs) and virtually always go in, no matter how bad I feel, because I know that being unemployed is 100x worse.

I literally just bag groceries, get grocery carts from a parking lot, and restock returned items. Sad part is, I started in a regular department, where I was even initially told that I was doing good, then that quickly turned into me being “too slow” and “missing too many details”.

I do not want any handouts, even if I am legally entitled, I’m already ashamed enough, and relying on others to survive is a TERRIBLE feeling, the fact that I rely on my own parents makes it somewhat more bearable, but I still get let know that I’m “past my time”, sure, I contribute to some things, but that’s such a small percentage of full living costs, my parents work very hard (I know life is hard, one of my biggest mistakes was growing up believing life was easy and just happened by itself).

I had internet friends, but withdrew myself because it felt pointless talking to people I’d never see. I also swore off LDRs, because I’d never get to see any of those girls/women in real life, even if I could, I can’t afford actual living costs, and even if she’s one of those women who takes care of her man (nothing wrong with that if it’s ok for a man to take care of a woman) I don’t want my livelihood dependent on anybody but myself.

If I have a girlfriend and we break up, I at least shouldn’t have to worry about being broke or homeless.

I’m willing to work, but it eats me up inside everyday, doing a job that nobody actually needs done (or at least takes virtually no skill to do whatsoever), having people treating me like I’m slow (stop calling me buddy unless you’re Canadian!) automatically seeing my job position, and feeling unworthy of any social interaction, if I befriended anyone, it wouldn’t be long before the questions start about my lifestyle, and I will be judged, negatively.

I have too many mental issues, emotional, even physical (some may or may not be caused from medication), and now I’m plagued with insecurity, and despite desperately wanting to break dependence on my family, lack of motivation to do anything.

OK, I do have motivation and interests, they’re just not very strong or consistent, nothing is really THAT INTERESTING, if it is, the interest won’t last long, until it’s just another memory that’s no longer associated with pleasure.

Other reasons working from home would be nice, more dependent on myself (well, if I’m self-employed, which would be true financial freedom, or at least as close to possible as it), less forced socializing means more energy, less anxiety (I’ve literally resisted a panic attack to run out of the building, although that was the first day of a job, and it was better as soon as the second day, although it was seasonal and they let me go after the season), and hell, this whole pandemic is reason enough to work from home if possible. 

I was never meant to be a social extrovert, if I can have any social and/or dating life, I don’t want it to be too much. 

It’s hard to feel any worth or value from doing work that you don’t feel purpose from, especially when you have nothing else, or nobody else, to live for outside of a job. 

Even if I don’t have to be a complete social hermit (I’ve come so close to becoming a complete misanthropist due to how I’m treated, and resisted falling into the cult of inceldom and misogyny, when I manage to avoid hatred, my perspective just leaves me with confusion) it’d still be nice to be able to work from home, and make not driving even easier (that’s caused so many issues for me, and I’ve spent so much on Uber and now risking catch the you know what, and some mentally unstable guy almost drove into incoming traffic with me as a rider!)

*Sigh*

Even when I’m told how much I’m appreciated and how good a job I do, I feel like worthless garbage, because that’s not a real accomplishment for somebody my age, I should have a REAL ADULT JOB and be living on my own, supporting myself.

I’m not worried about supporting a family (why the hell would I want to create kids against their will who could suffer just like I have? That’s assuming any woman even wanted to do that with me) but feel I need to make a lot of money just for myself, for freedom, because true freedom only exists with a lot of money. I’ve never felt free, yet my family claims that “Democrat socialists” will take our freedom away, especially because “socialism is the first step leading to communism”. 

Well ONE, I think America needs a better social safety net and PROGRESSION (we should strive to be like Denmark, the happiest nation on Earth, me may have a much bigger country, but we also have more wealth to cover it) and TWO, I’ve never felt freedom anyway.

The closest I ever got to freedom almost left me homeless, that hurt my sense of competence even more. Being told I’m stupid for trying doesn’t feel like freedom, and being stranded from running out of savings certainly doesn’t feel like freedom.

I was told to try and change my situation if I was so miserable, and when I tried just that, my family told me how wrong it was and that I needed to go back to sitting at home, and I ran out of savings from motel rooms and applying to basic jobs, ending up staying with other family and relying on government assistance just to eat!

I WANT MY OWN LIFE! AND I WANT TO PROVIDE IT FOR MYSELF! 

I am so different than most people, and it’s only getting worse...."
Is it common for hr to give job seekers false hope?,"I’ve been looking for employment for a while now. Unfortunately I haven’t had much luck. I spoke with an hr representative at a company recently and had a phone interview. She told me she would contact me soon. I waited and decided to contact her after not hearing back a week later. Her reply seemed positive and she told me she would call me that day, but didn’t. Is this common?should I move on?

Thanks"
How do I accept that I have to work the rest of my life?,"Hey all I didn't really know how to put the title but I'm a 25 year old and I am really struggling to wrap my mind around working my whole life still.

I've been working since I was 16 and have had quite a few different jobs since then ranging from a couple months to 3-4 years.

I recently started a job that is actually gonna set me up pretty comfortably for the future but I just cannot get used to the idea that I will be working the rest of my life. I have felt this way through all my jobs and family and friends say to suck it up this is how life gets but I just can't accept it.

I spend my whole days working and use my weekend to do nothing productive then feel bad on sundays when I have to go back to work on monday. The problem is when I dont do anything on the weekend i just usually game out and not really do anything. But even when I have weekend plans and spend the weekend away from home I don't feel relaxed. In fact I haven't found anything to occupy my times on weekends that makes me feel okay with going back to work.

I then get into this cycle of where I just can't stand it anymore and quit my job because of all the pressure.

All I can think of when im at work is coming home to game or hang out with people and then when my weekend comes all I can think about is all the million things I want to do and would rather do than go to work next week.


I have tried to use my own time to do things I am interested in but my job is quite physical and I spend most my time recovering on weekends and after work when my hobbies include exercising or being active.

90 percent of the jobs I have worked have all been physical jobs and I really don't want this to be the rest of my life. I have no real college or university experience I don't know what to do really.

I have tried talking to Councillors and work on bettering myself but after a few months I always feel the same way I do now and I really wish I could feel better about life. 

Sorry if this seems like a jumbled mess, just trying to work this off my chest. 


edit: Thanks everyone for the advice I have read it all today and will try to reply more when I have some time!"
Is there a career out there that would suit someone who enjoys in-depth research and who also likes tracking things?,"I'm addicted to information: I love reading about new topics and exploring them in-depth. I like reading through scientific papers on topics to see what the evidence-based studies say. I often have like 30 tabs open on Chrome at the same time, most of which are interesting things I'm reading about or watching.

I also like to track things. I regularly update my Excel personal budget and I've previously tracked stuff like calories, steps, weights lifted at the gym.

The last thing I really enjoy doing is writing. I am good at explaining technical concepts to a non-technical audience. 

I have a degree in a math/stats discipline.

Is there any career that could in some way combine these three interests? The first thing that came to mind was a data analyst but I would appreciate some other suggestions. When I picture myself as a data analyst, I don't feel much excitement and I think a modicum of fire in the belly should be a prerequisite to pursue any career. 

Thanks for any advice."
What can an introvert do to feel comfortable socialising in a corporate work environment?,"Starting my first job soon in a corporate environment (bank) and I’m worried about whether I’d be able to get along with my colleagues and bosses. I know many pick up smoking as a way to get to know colleagues & bosses, or flow with the in crowd but I don’t smoke and don’t intend to. 

What else can I do in this competitive environment where connections and relationships are so important?"
"How should you act if you have a lot of experience at a job, but are treated as a newbie?","Hello, I just started a new job. I have 5+ years in the industry including management experience. I'm at a new job, but they treat me like a complete newbie, so i've just been ""ok ok ok"" everything, like I know everything i'm being taught and I know the work because i've done it for years for multiple companies. I understand that it's gonna take time to build up trust, so i'm just being super humble and not really saying ""i know i know i know"" all I say is ""oh yeah i've done this before. it's really familiar."" Is this normal?"
Can't get any kind of job. What happens to people like me?,"I'm in my early-mid twenties and I've never had a job.

Without getting into too much detail, I've had a problem throughout my entire life which had disallowed me from participating effectively in any kind of institutional setting. I would summarize the problem by saying that I can't deal with ambiguity. In school, I would sometimes not turn in work that I had already done because I wasn't exactly sure where or how to turn it in, and I was too afraid to ask. That's an extreme case, but I had lots of other smaller issues like that. Not sure of how to do some kind of project that they provided little to no information on the specifics of. I'm sure people can relate, but the difference between you and me is that you seem to be able to bs your way through it and find some way to figure out what they're trying to ask you to do.

I was homeschooled for a lot of my life, and my problems with ambiguous instructions began in 4th grade where I attended a public school for the first time. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I generally lack common sense in a lot of areas, leading to various other problems functioning. I would go into more detail but it seems unnecessary for now. The basic point I'm trying to make is that I can't deal with normal institutional scenarios. I'm pretty intelligent and pretty talented in some areas, but when an obligation presents itself in the form of an institution, that's when I can't deal with it. I don't want to deal with it but I also can't. Somehow, when a bunch of bureaucrats or a bunch of profiteers get involved in some sort of activity, they turn the activity itself into a secondary goal. The main goal is to fulfill the bureaucracy's requirements, or to suck up to the right people, or to help your boss make profit. No one wants me to do some task for the sake of simply doing the task, and I think the spirit of that situation is just very difficult for me to function in, and the ambiguous instructions that come up in that situation are just the cherry on top, guaranteeng that I won't be able to do what the job is asking. As an example, I'm somewhat talented at computer security, and I enjoy messing around on my own with it, but in an employment scenario, instead of just doing what needs to be done, I'm suddenly gonna have to write a report, and present a slideshow, or some other bureaucratic garbage which as I said, is designed to fulfill some need other than the immediate requirements of the job, which is where I struggle.

So anyway, just to finish my history. I went to middle school until I left in the 7th grade when I dropped out and became homeschooled again, which didn't actually entail much official schooling. I mostly just educated myself on stuff I happened to be interested in. My parents knew I couldn't take public school anymore. I went to a community college during the time that I was finishing up my homeschooling time. It took me over five years but eventually I got a associates degree and in college I suffered from all the same problems I laid out before. But I did get the degree. It's useless for me however.

So, I'm now in a situation where I've kind of accepted that I can't get a job. If I were to go to an interview, I'd be far too awkward and unable to follow the instructions during the interview, both in preparation for it and in terms of answering the questions during it. Secondly, if I did ever get a job somehow, I'd be fired within a couple weeks as soon as the employers see that I can't perform. My parents have been understanding to some degree and have supported me up until now, but our financial situation is much tighter now and I really want to try and help out, even though I know I can't.

I would say that the only job I could really get would be some kind of job where the boss tells you exactly what to do and there's no reading between the lines whatsoever. For example, the boss says ""take this shovel and move these rocks from this pile into that pile."" I can do that, but even with manual labor, a lot of it is too difficult for me to interpret what they're asking me to do. Does anyone have any advice on what I should try to do? I basically just want some kind of manual labor job (not dissing manual labor at all here, just to be clear) where I don't really have to engage in deep thought about what's going on. I was thinking maybe some kind of assembly line job could be possible. I really want to try and find something here, but I don't really think there's a specific job that allows for simple manual labor like that. Do such jobs exist, and if so, what sort of titles would they be under and how might I apply for it? I I just wonder what happens to people like me sometimes. I mean what if I can't get any kind of job? I live in the US and we have basically no welfare state whatsoever. Especially since I've never had a job, they won't give me anything. I guess I'm just gonna be homeless, but I think I might have missed some kind of opportunity in the form of a simple, manual labor job that doesn't require previous experience in carpentry or construction or anything like that, and that doesn't require any of the thinking on your feet that I'm so bad at. I really appreciate any advice."
Who’s making 50K+ working from home? I NEED YOU.,"Hi Redditors!

Okay, it’s official: I am completely fed up with my current job and I am ready to make the switch to working from home. 
I’m a 23F with 3 1/2 years of sales experiences. I have some college, but no degree or certifications. I currently make around 50K a year right now, and that’s the only reason why I stay. I honestly don’t know where to start looking or the best way to make this transition. 
If anyone here is living my dream, and making 50K+ from home I would love your advice and guidance on how I can be in the same position.  Hopefully the right person sees this, and can deliver me from my current job woes.
Thanks!"
Should you take a job because you are unemployed and wasting time and being unproductive?,?
How do you deal with performance reviews and goal setting when you no longer care about your job?,"I am going in for my annual goal setting and performance review this week with my line manager. 


I’ve been at this company for about 2.5 years, but my heart has never been in it. I took the job for the money. I moved from client-side back to consulting.


Though I’ve been looking for a new role elsewhere since I started the job, (and gotten a few offers over this duration), I liked my coworkers and wanted to give it an honest try.  TBH, it wasn’t going so badly. 


Then at the start of 2019, there was a leadership change both at CEO level, and Regional Director (RD) for my geography.  It’s been a massive cultural shift, especially in our region where the new RD was brought in from a competitor with a very different business approach.  It’s a very poor cultural alignment. 


Now there is lots of alienation among the existing leadership cohort as new RD brings in his team from his past company. Of course these new joiners all have a similar cultural approach.  It’s getting pretty toxic all around as several of us know we are being setup to exit the business. 


I’m not immune.  My role is being redefined under this new regime. RD no longer wants me in a region-wide team leadership and oversight role, he just wants me to focus on my city, hands on with projects. It’s great that I won’t have to travel so much, but it feels like a demotion, not the next step to long term success.


HQ (on another continent) loves my work so far and has offered me additional equity in the company. I have great support back there and my overall salary situation is fantastic. As the new RD seems to be pushing me out the door, the award of equity feels like a mind-f**k.


I’m eager to move on, but golden handcuffs are tough to shake off.  I need to do the best I can where I am at until I find another landing spot. 


So what to say in the goal setting?  I’m totally unengaged, disinterested, and resentful. 


I know playing it too candidly isn’t the right thing, even though my line manager is equally disaffected by the organisational transformation that surrounds us. 


Any suggestions on how to do this dance would be appreciated. My emotions are getting in the way and clouding my judgement."
Is it bad to quit your job without another lined up?,"I have an extremely unhealthy work situation and I would like to quit in order to dedicate all my time to applying and finding a new job. 

&#x200B;

I have been at this company for over a year now, but am concerned how it would be perceived by future employers that I left for the reason I did."
Which path after high school?,"I'm 17 and a junior in high school right now. My grades are amazing, I have a 4.5 gpa and have played a sport all 3 years so far. I'm in the top 15 of my class but I am confused as to what I want to do in the future. Throughout my whole life, I've been told by many people to go to college to get a degree and make lots of money. Growing up, many people told me that I am smart and have a lot of potential. But I feel guilty because I want to do something that is hands on, such as being a firefighter, mechanic, electrician, etc. I asked my counselor that I'm thinking about a trade school and all she said was that it was pointless since I've already taken so many AP classes. My family is really poor, and if we had the money, I probably would become a doctor or a lawyer. But I've heard so many stories about people drowning in debt and not finding jobs after they graduate. My financial situation is bad enough already, which is why I'm seriously considering going to a trade school instead of college. I'm honestly scared that I'm making the wrong choice. I don't care about making 6 figures, I just want to make enough so I can help my family and make sure my little sisters can go to college without worrying too much about money. So, should I go to a trade school after high school or continue my studies so I go to college?"
Does anyone have experience with never being satisfied with jobs?,"Little bit of background. I'm 32 (M) and have been working for 4 years now. The first 3 years of my career I worked abroad. Just over a year ago I moved back home. I'm currently at my 5th employer after changing jobs a few time because of moving between cities but also because of a few very bad experiences where I didn't like/hated my job. I've worked at a wide variety of companies as a data analyst/market researcher, from scale-ups to some of the world's largest advisory firms. The pay has always been very good. Currently, I'm working at a bank.

Everywhere around me I see people being super engaged with the company/job. They appear to be what some call ""passionate"". The problem is that I've never been satisfied (or passionate) with any of the jobs I had. The first few months I'm super excited getting to know the company, the people, and learn the ropes. However, after a few months that feeling fades and I start to think about what to do next. 

This has resulted in things like casually looking on LinkedIn for jobs, getting hooked on the idea of starting my own business from home (e.g., dropshipping, starting a blog, and much more have passed) but never really going for it, focusing on hobbies hoping to make a living out of it and working om my technical skills (actually useful for my career).

It's not that I hate my job or that I wake up every day dreading going to work; it just not fulfills me to the same extent as it does for the ""passionate"" people. Maybe I get bored very easily, maybe I'm not in the right field of work, maybe I've just had bad luck with jobs, maybe I should change my mindset. I don't know!

I'm curious to find out if this sounds familiar to people. Are there any people who have experienced the same? And how did you overcome this?"
When should I tell my boss my wife is pregnant after starting a new job?,"My wife and I found out that she is pregnant while I was job searching after being laid off from my last job. At present she is 3 months pregnant and due in July.

I started a new job last week (big step up from my previous one!) And am now wondering when the best time to tell my boss that my wife is expecting? 
I plan on taking a week off when the baby comes, but of course I'm not going to know which week that is until my wife goes into labor.

What do you all think?  TIA!"
I got a degree in Computer Science two years ago and realized the software industry culture isn't for me. How do I take the first step in changing direction?,"After I graduated in 2017, I had a long, drawn out mental breakdown and realized in the middle of it that my career doesn't suit my temperament at all.

I absolutely cannot meet the expectation of showing up to work for 9-12 hours a day, staring at lines of code which mean nothing, only existing to make money for a company, and being locked away from the ""natural"" world. I simply don't have the interest, let alone the focus, to serve a company like that. My emotional well being can't handle it. This became especially clear after ending up in the hospital last summer in the middle of my breakdown. 

So I want to focus on what I find interesting and important, but also balance that with what keeps me centered emotionally. My personal interests are in biology and organic chemistry. I've considered finding a grad program that combines either of those with computed science, but I haven't taken any undergrad classes for what I think I want to do now.

If I did want to go to grad school, or even just get a degree in biology or chemistry, how would that even work? Would they require me to take undergrad classes first? I'd like to make my first degree mean at least something, but I also wouldn't mind abandoning it altogether if I felt I'd be happier. I should note I don't care about money really whatsoever. I'd just like enough to survive.

Thank you so much for any response! I just need anything to push me in the right direction. I need to survive but I'd rather be poor and happy than rich and miserable."
I think I'm having a burnout breakdown and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job?,"I'm  the introspective and analytic guy so, sometimes, I like to do my job  alone, without the interference of others, and sometimes, when I  interact with people, at the end of the day I feel exhausted.

I  work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee  who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,  taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so  many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have  to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning  of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new  clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes  they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the  company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My  worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing  to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really  overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called  to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides  all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been  fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So  I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of  what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* restless
* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying really, really easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgetting any information
* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious

I  asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I  tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did  was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

TL;DR:  I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of  stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away."
Which IT job has the highest earning and job prospect out of the three ahead of me?,"I’m looking for guidance from seasoned IT professionals about the career paths ahead of me. 

I got laid off due to COVID and I’m wondering how to best prepare for the post COVID opportunities. I have time now to sharpen some skills.

Background:
Bachelors in Economics
Masters in International Relations 

I got dragged into the tech world a few years ago (after several years of completely unrelated experience).

During the period of employment, I started working more and more in tech related roles. It was a start up and so I wore several different hats. 

Here is a rough breakdown of responsibilities:

- 5% QA (writing test cases, assigning tickets, creating QA timelines)

- 15% Product management (wireframe, get client requirements, talk and design with engineers)

- 30% operations (writing SQL queries - Oracle/SQL server, building tableau dashboards) 

- 30% data analytics (creating segments, data cleaning, regressions - mostly in Excel, R)

- 20% random stuff 

Questions:

1)Out of these, which do you believe has a higher earning potential over time?

Data Analyst 

Product management/BA

Operations Analyst 

2)How important is it to get IT qualifications / certificates to be employed by larger companies? Since my formal education is unrelated to IT, I feel like my resume may be over looked."
I'm an introvert and I want to go into politics - am I crazy?,"I'm really passionate about a number of social issues and I love debate/public speaking as well. Politics is something I've always been really passionate about but I'm not sure if it's for me.

I'm definetely not shy. I love meeting new people and listening to their ideas. However, once you get to know me I become slightly more quiet and I prefer to listen more than speak. People think of me as a strong leader but when asked whether I am an extrovert or an introvert, they usually respond with introvert. Is that bad? Am I kidding myself by wanting to work in politics?

I'm a high school student and I've been good at STEM for my whole life but its really not what I'm passionate about. Despite winning a number of debate awards and running a successful international NGO, my parents still don't think I'm cut out for public service and they think they should stick with STEM. Are they right?"
"Does Anyone Else Experience Tunnel Vision at Work or ""Lose the Forest Through the Tress""?","Does anyone else have this problem? I am in project management so this can cause issues. But, it mostly only occurs due to the following:

1. I am surprised with a task and anxiety or pressure takes over.
2. The specific task requires me to be focused for a long period of time.

One example happened just yesterday. It was my first day on the job and I was so focused on completing tasks on this new higher checklist that I failed to realize there were two other related documents listed within a specific task's text that had to be completed. It was 3:30 and these were due at EOB. I quickly started on these documents and realized today that on the Excel document I over looked the instructions tab and other tab I had to fill out.

My old manager gave me this feedback at my previous job and I am afraid I am not improving. I can't help but feel like I have tunnel vision.

Any ideas on how to combat this?

Thanks."
Is seeking therapy after being laid off from your dream job acceptable?,"Going to a therapist after being laid off from my dream job

I’m feeling incredibly lost. It’s been 5 months and I’m still having issues coping with having been let go from a job I truly loved. Unfortunately in the industry I’m in, things have been tanking across the board.

Am I too old to find a work at home job?,My employer of 20 years has flipped her lid and been treating me like shit. Its so bad that everyone talks about it. She cut my pay by 50 dollars a week and I still have to work 53 hours a week. Only bring home 375 a week. She has stopped paying all of us with a paper check cause she got mad when she found out we did mobile deposit. Now she pays us cash and yesterday she paid me 375 dollars allin 5 dollar bills and smiled when she gave it to me. This is just a few of many evil things in the past month. But to get to the point I am 53 years old and I am an introvert and do not have reliable transportation so a remote.job would be perfect. I am semi intelligent I and I am a very slow typist but extremely fast reader and can comprehend what I read with ease even While skimming an article. I hate math but love words. I have no tech traing but can figure my way around a computer. I need to make approximately 11 dollars.an hour. I do not have a nest egg as I have to take care of my 84 year old mom that lives with me. So I can not quit until I have another job. I am literally sick to my stomach everyday at this job and I feel like I am running out of options. Are there any remote jobs that I could do at my age that do not involve call centers and great typing skills. I am not afraid of hard work cause its killing me now at my present job. Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated. Thanks
"35 y/o, $500K~ net worth, Senior Manager in tech... but no degree and having a hard time advancing further. Is an online BA + MBA worth it at my age, or should I invest in other ways?","**TL:DR is in the title.**

35 years old, attended college for 5-6 years but never finished a degree. About 15-20 hours away, but haven't enrolled anywhere since 2008-09.

Ran a small business for a while, had other jobs, then in 2011 got into a niche online streaming industry very early and had success. Eventually became a founding member (but not an owner) of a start-up company in Silicon Valley that was later acquired by a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in the world. That happened four years.

Since that time, have worked my way up internally to Senior Manager ($160-170K), was on track for Director by end of this year ($200-220K), but unfortunately a new boss was hired from the East Coast and he and I are no simpatico. No demotion, but was involuntarily reassigned to a smaller role, managing 20% of the people I used to, all remote. It's time to go.

Due to my background and experience in what it still a relatively niche part of the industry, expected to be able to make a non-lateral move relatively easily. Was very wrong. No callbacks at all for Director+ level positions, only Senior Manager level positions. Have gone deep into the process in a few, but no offer yet but expecting one next week... but it'll be for a Senior Manager position with only a modest (10-20% pay increase). Have become convinced this is the result of a lack of a degree, especially an MBA, which those who were eventually hired into the best positions I sought had in common.

Currently engaged to be married next year and living together, household income of around $260K in the Bay Area, around $400K in stock and $100K in other investments tucked away. We're comfortable and stable.

Here's the question: At my age, does it make sense to sell about $150K in stock for me to complete an online degree at my former university (they offer Reagent Bachelor of Arts degrees (RBA) specifically for people in my situation) and then enroll at a top 10 online MBA school (most likely USC)? Or would I be better off letting that money grow, using it to fund other FIRE oriented projects, etc? Are online MBA's worth it? Or am I misguided in believing they're the big difference maker in breaking through to Director+ level?

Long term goal is to bank away $2MM minimum, $4MM optimum to retire as early as possible. How I get there doesn't matter to me.

Thanks in advance to any who are willing to weigh in!"
"I'm 23, I graduated college six months ago, and I'm still unemployed. Do I stick with what I went to school for or chase my childhood dream?","I had my 23rd birthday this week, which was also almost six months to the day since I graduated from college with a degree in video production. In these past six months I have done essentially nothing with my life. It has been a constant mental battle trying to figure out just where exactly I fit in the real world. I'm torn between potential career paths and paralyzed with fear that I won't make the right choice.

While I certainly enjoyed my production classes and learning about the world of media in college it was never what I set out to learn at the start. I began my college career as an engineering student, but difficulties with my school's math classes forced me to change my major after my freshman year. I changed to the ""university studies"" major, which is a nice way of saying undecided, and floated around taking business, sociology, and media classes before the deadline for me to declare a major. I chose media production because it was what I enjoyed most of the areas I had studied, and because it reminded me of the fun I had doing the lighting for school plays in high school. But I honestly have no desire to spend the rest of my days editing news clips or sports highlights.

My true passion has always been cars. I've spent countless hours since I was young researching and learning about cars, and different ways to maintain and modify them. I always wanted to have a project car, and eventually become a mechanic but my parents wanted me to drive something safe and new, and to get a bachelors degree so I could get a ""real job."" Now I finally have a project car, but I'm too afraid to do anything with it because I've had the idea that I shouldn't waste my time and money on cars drilled into my brain by my family. They are also very white collar, and whenever I bring up the idea of becoming a mechanic again it is almost always dismissed for reasons such as ""you won't make enough money to support a family."" 

So what do I do? I need to start working soon at this point, because I want to start moving forward with other aspects of adult life like saving to move out of my mom's house, and dating (which I have not had much luck with since I'm unemployed and live with my mother obviously). I enjoy video production, but I'm not passionate about it like I am with cars. However, I actually have some background with videography whereas I have very little hands on automotive experience, and I would likely have to start out doing oil and tire changes for around $10/hour before I could move up to a full mechanic position. Either way I'd probably only make around $30-40k a year in the end whether I am a video editor or working as a mechanic at a dealership."
Poor choices and laziness has led me to severe job dissatisfaction and fear of the future - where do I go from here?,"I'm nearly 27, I live in the UK,  and definitely think I'm experiencing a quarter life crisis. Here is my story:

&#x200B;

I always enjoyed being creative, and while I never planned to go I made a last minute decision to go to university to study BA Games Art, and graduated with a 2:2. I consider it to be an essentially useless qualification that isn't particularly useful, and something that I was never good enough at to seriously pursue anyway.

&#x200B;

After university I fell into a customer service call centre environment, then after nearly 3 years I joined a software company working in sales. I wasn't terrible at it, but the constant stress and pressure made me dread it everyday. Still, I stuck it out for nearly 3 years and found myself in a position where I could take a year off and travel, with the idea I'd do some soul searching and ""find myself"".

&#x200B;

Now I'm back, I've joined another smaller software company as an account manager, although there is no sales element here. As I sit here writing this, I'm kinda terrified that I still don't know what I'm doing. I can't really see much room for progression in this career path, except into more sales type roles, which I know I don't want to do. As I get older money is becoming more important to me as I find I can barely afford to rent let alone think about getting any assets of my own.

&#x200B;

I find myself looking at posts online about retraining, going back to university, starting again a whole new career - but I don't have the first idea about how to do that.

&#x200B;

Has anyone here experienced anything like this and could provide some advice on how to get out of this rut?"
"Considering taking a 20k pay cut for quality of life improvement. Am I insane? 27yo male, married, looking 85k to 65k.","I’m 27 years old, married with no kids (thinking 4-5 years out), own a home with mortgage well below what we could have afforded and have combined cash savings around 8k with 25k in combined retirement funds. We know we are behind on retirement but came out of school with a combined 100k in student loan debt and have aggressively paid it down to around 40k now (she has BS and I have BS/MBA). Overall we make considerably more right now than we need and have been using that on the student loans. 

I’ve worked in construction management since getting out of school and have had ups and downs with that. I’m very good at it and enjoy building teams and systems, but in two different roles in the industry I’ve experienced the same issues with massive hour expectations and work/life balance struggles. For context, it’s not uncommon to work long weekdays then cap the week off with over 40 hours between Friday to Sunday. My wife and I have had some issues based on her frustration with me never being home and being exhausted to the point of uselessness when I am home. I can’t blame her at all. 

I’m very strongly considering switching to manufacturing and taking a 15-20k hit in salary as a result (in a maintenance management or planning role). I initially started looking for manufacturing roles that would be around the same salary, but most either want lots of industry experience or have major travel elements. This move would however bring my hours down a lot to close to 40, and most of the roles I’m pursuing have flexibility in the hours. She works 530-4 M-Th, and while I don’t expect to work 4 10s it’s looking like I could make my M-F schedule 6-3 or something similar to get home before/when she does. 

I’m leaning heavily towards taking the step, but what negatives am I not considering? I know that this move would delay the student loan payoffs and am completely prepared for that, but what else should I be thinking about? 

Most of my family I talk to tell me to stick it out until the loans are gone, but my big fear is looking back in 4 years at a zero student loan balance and either having lost my wife or realizing I’d wasted a full decade of my youth in an industry I don’t enjoy. "
"I'm 23 have a BS in Biology and a contract job ending soon, what should be my next move?","I graduated last year with a BS in Biology and a minor in Psychology. I've been working in a chemistry lab over the last year to pay off my loans but the contract is ending. I want to get involved with either Psychedelic Research or a startup, but I don't know where to go or what to do because of Covid. I also can't decide if going back to school for a Masters is worth it if I haven't felt out either path. Either way I would likely have to move away from home which I am comfortable with.  I was originally hoping to spend this next year teaching english abroad but that doesn't seem to be a possibility right now."
How transparent should I be after being terminated?,"I was abruptly let go from my employer for violating their time reporting policy. My project job leader wasn't pleased with the verdict as this could've been a teachable moment for my benefit where a warning would've sufficed. Nevertheless, he has offered to be a strong reference for me, and I'm grateful that I have that support. I dwell and feel genuine regret over this anomalous incident, but I recognize that it's made me a better person.

Moving forward, my questions are:

* How transparent should I be to my professional network in regards to finding my next role? 
* What are recommended job search strategies, particularly during the pandemic?
* Tips on evading inquiries from ex-coworkers, family members, or friends  when it's still a sensitive matter for me to share?
* Should I be transparent to a recruiter when they ask why I left the organization or wait until the interview with the hiring manager?

Edit: Addressing some questions, this was my first job out of grad school, it was my first offense and a misunderstanding on my part with no monetary benefit or expectations of being paid more as dictated by the company’s compensation policies."
Ever felt lost in your career? What helped you?,"I have had 3 different jobs in 4 years and always felt something was wrong. I worked as customer support, sales and now project manager and never been happy. I have changed jobs too often to allow another mistake. I feel lost. Career coach did not really help.

I realize that I am uncomfortable when I don’t feel in lead or knowing all the details of what they are talk about. But supporting and doing repetitive tasks make me unmotivated. 

What I love: Beeing good at something or a product and talk to customers / present it proudly and design a perfect solution for them. Then lead a team to produce it accordingly... I am happy to put in the hours and travel. I feel like I worked 10 years just to think I need to start from the bottom everytime...

Any idea?"
Is it always a red flag when a company is in a rush to hire?,"I'll try to make this brief - I have been looking for a job for about 2.5 months as my current job is super stressful (or alternately boring) & the commute is extremely long. I found a job in banking operations that pays more & is closer to home. Everything sounds good as far as pay, benefits, job duties, etc. It's a smaller regional bank, so unfortunately not a lot of info on Glassdoor or reviews on Indeed, no idea what turnover is like there.

I interviewed this morning & the manager let me know I was their final interview. It seemed to go well. About an hour later, I get a call & they're offering me the job! I asked if I could get back to them first thing tomorrow, but they want me to decide TODAY as the main HR person is leaving for vacation on Wednesday. They even asked if I could start in 1 week, which I said no, I would need 2 weeks at the very least to give notice to my current job.

I feel like in the past, the places that seem really desperate to hire are usually that way for a reason. Are there any questions I could ask them beforehand to make sure I'm not just filling a chair for them & they actually really want me there long term? Any advice is appreciated!!!"
Being Honest in Exit Interview - Is It Ever Appropriate?,"Interested to read everyone's thoughts on this. I've always read and heard that you should never be honest in the exit interview, never give feedback, they don't deserve it, etc etc.

My question to the group is, is there ever situations where it may actually be of some benefit to the company you're leaving?

&#x200B;

I've got a potential job offer coming up. I've asked for a raise at my current company, citing numerous sources of data suggesting that it's a fair argument. The response is ""we don't have it in the budget this year, CEO wouldn't go for it, etc"". Other employees have told me that they have received the same response. But magically, when someone gets a job offer paying more, my current company matches it.

It's a situation where I enjoy my boss and the company. Just not their old school approach to compensation. Even if they matched my potential offer, I won't take it. I'm not mad at them and there's no ill will.

I'm confident that I could say this in an exit interview without burning bridges. We have a good enough relationship for that.

My thought is, is it such a bad thing that I call my current company on this? Yes, they may not change. But they sure as hell won't if no one says anything about it and just smiles and gives the ""It's just an opportunity I can't turn down"" answer. If I could potentially open the door for someone else to get a raise in result of me leaving, to me that's a win.

What say ye? Let's discuss.

&#x200B;

Edit: When I say ""being honest"" I'm not implying that anyone go in and lash out, be emotional, unprofessional, and offensive. More-so the opposite. Professional with courtesy and tact."
"It feels like everyone has a ""calling"". How do I figure out my calling?","So, I was going to be a doctor. Then I found the love of my life and realized I didn't want to wait ten years before I'm working as a doctor. Now I'm thinking of going to grad school for I/O psychology, but I keep hearing that maybe there are no jobs in this field. 

&#x200B;

I keep bouncing around and I don't know where I'm heading. I have the opportunity to be whatever I want to be, I'm just so terrified of making the wrong choice. I almost have my bachelors in psychology and am trying to figure out if I should put in some extra time to get my pre-PA or pre-med classes done with just in case, or if I should just move into grad school.

&#x200B;

I always wanted to help people. But I also have this sense that I need to prove that I'm smart and can achieve a distinguished position like a doctor or lawyer. I need to be proud of myself. I want to change the world and be able to afford to send my kids to college. Sorry for this rant, I just want to know if anyone can relate to this early life crisis and if any real people have real advice."
Is it okay to quit a job because you feel like you are in the wrong place?,"Hello, I feel like I’m not in the right place considering what I went to school for, plus additional time and money (thousands) spent on certification and education outside of regular school. 

My job is completely irrelevant to my degree. I took an extra year in school to major in a specific field, and spent thousands on outside education. I took the offer because it was the first paying offer I received. Almost 2 years later and nothing has changed. No opportunities. 

My job does not make use of my potential. Anyone could do this job. A grade 10 student would probably do this for minimum wage. 

If i quit, it’s easy money that’s loss. But easy isn’t good for my mind. I need stimulation/challenges. 

If i quit now, i’ll be jobless until I find something else, and I don’t know how long that will be. 

Sorry this turned out to be a semi rant. I’m seeking and appreciate any feedback and advice. Thanks"
What do you do outside of work to improve yourself or advance your career?,"Many of you may have read a quote that says, ""Don't work eight hours for a company, then go home and not work on your own goals. You're not tired, you're uninspired.""

That has really stuck in my brain. As I'm currently in a good job that's getting me experience that I need, but is very much a stepping stone position, I know that I need to put in work outside of my 9-5 to eventually get where I want to be. That being said, I'm floundering a bit to find the right way to go about it.

What do you do outside of your ""day job"" that helps your improve yourself, gain measurable experience, or grow your network? How do you put in additional work to meet your career goals? Even if it's industry specific, I'd love to hear! "
Careers that aren’t boring?,"I’m really lost right now. I just graduated high school and I really don’t know what I want to do with my life. 

At the moment my only idea is to join the military (United States) and see how it goes. I really want to go to college on the side but I don’t know what I want to get into. I tried coding in high school and it didn’t make sense, making me feel like i won’t be successful in the technology field. Medical field costs too much+ time in school.  Only other career field that’s on my mind is engineering but I don’t know if I’ll be successful?

Is it okay to feel like I’ll fail? Will college actually teach you unlike in high school? I feel like high school didn’t really prep me and I’ll be behind"
"How can I manage-up a raging micromanager who lacks manners? Specifically, how can I address a 4-hr drive with him?","Here are the facts:

I have been with this new company for about 2 months. 

I've witnessed my manager have a rage fit (akin to a temper tantrum) directed at my colleague over something my manager misunderstood. 

My manager is a hyper micromanager that has embarrassed me ""in front of"" (typically through email) individuals both in and outside of our company.

He has a tendency towards rude behavior such as cutting you off mid sentence once he's decided he doesn't have time to listen. Also for example... He has told me to ""be silent"" in conference calls, then when I quietly try to assist him with a misspoken word or a note he's searching for he throws his hand up in the air to mime ""Silence!!"". 

The issue I have currently that I need help with is:
We have a project kick off meeting to attend 4 hours from our office. Long story short, he has told me that I am going no matter what. If I drive my car, I will be driving him back from the meeting, he will be taking a train to get to the meeting. 

He did not ask if I would give him a ride. He told me. He's done this once before regarding an hour-long drive to a meeting. (He asked: Are you driving to the meeting or taking a train? I told him: I'm going to drive. He said: Okay, then I'm going with you.) The meeting was first thing in the morning, I'd have to drive to pick him up then drive to the meeting.  Incidentally this didn't happen, because I was pulled to cover other work.

I am physically sick with anxiety, despite some honest efforts to accept it and process it. I'm even detailing my car this weekend, as I think that will set me slightly more at ease.

 In part I know it will be ""fine"", I don't believe he'll treat me poorly in the car. I am incredibly uncomfortable though, his behavior is inappropriate at best. I am also a young woman and uncomfortable with his apparent subconscious need to intimidate me and my female colleague.

Does anyone have any advice? Tips on how to get out of this? Anything that will set me at ease, and ease my nausea?

I know I could look at it as an opportunity to boost my relationship, but he's universally resented at my company and by our subcontractors."

Is it possible to get a good job with a DUI?,"I was pulled over for a DUI almost a year ago. It wasnt intentional, I woke up from sleeping and drove, since then I decided to quit drinking.  I'm wanting to join an apprentice as an electrician, plumber, or HVAC tech, I  have a small side business as a handyman now. My question is, is it even worth considering because no one will hire someone with a DUI in that industry, or should I go fulltime as a handyman when I move down south and work for myself. I'm 29 and looking for a new career path. Thanks!"
Any job ideas for an easily overwhelmed introvert?,"I feel like I have struck out at every job I've ever had. Working as a financial analyst was too overwhelming; the deadlines were too stressful, and being in a bright office full of people drained my energy.

Working in a warehouse was too loud, boring, and didn't pay enough to survive.

Now I'm working in nonprofit admin. I can't deal with spending 8 hours a day in an office full of people, just physically being present at work takes all the energy I have. I continually miss grant application deadlines and take way to long to respond to emails because I am so mentally exhausted that I often can't type cohesive sentences.

I will likely be out of a job soon and I just don't know what to try next. I have not seen any jobs I feel well suited to, and I'm curious if anybody has any recommendations for someone who hates being around other people and falls to pieces when confronted with any stressful situation.

I have two bachelors degrees and did very well in school, however I have performed very poorly in every job I've had so far. I'm not interested in programming as I am not capable of coding proficiently.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
What careers are looking to be obsolete/ automated?,I graduated this year and I am taking up the trade route to get a start on money and I want the flexibility to work almost anywhere while moving around frequently.

Would you stay at a company that hasn't offered a cost of living adjustment in 2 years?," 

I  like the company I work for. However, I have been here 3 years and my  last actual ""raise"" of any kind was over 2 years ago. Last year bonuses  added a couple of thousand to my yearly income. This year I expect to  make 3-4k less than last year.

From  my knowledge of the company, we are making similar money as we did last  year. My 3 year mark was 2 months ago with not a hint of a raise or cost of living adjustment. My pay is the same as it was 2 year ago so  far this year. No bonuses given so far this year.

Base  pay is 44k for a Marketing, IT & Website management role in the  company(multiple hats). Located in the south(USA). 2 weeks vacation, no  sick leave and a small healthcare credit($125) each month that won't cover any descent plan on the marketplace. No dental, life or vision. No 401k either. I was told offering healthcare was too expensive for a small business so a credit is offered instead.

The credit has not been increased in what I can only guess is more than 7 years. Each year the healthcare on the marketplace goes up by 14-25%, or so it seems. In the 3 years I have been here my tiny credit is worth even less towards a plan. Most family plans are now 850-1400 a month that cover anything. $125 is a drop in the bucket.

We have around 20 employees most of the time. I make most things work  around here along with managing several websites(and building them). I  also have the official title of Marketing Manager and do marketing tasks but its not the main role even though I have the title. I report directly to  the owner and a direct supervisor above me. I am also the companies Photographer/Video guy with our own studio. 

At this point in my life(30 years old) I really want more paid leave, some actual sick time and more pay to raise a family on. A larger healthcare credit or actual healthcare would be nice. 

Thoughts?"
Should you apply for a job even if you don't have *every* qualification?,"I did a lot of hiring and firing in one of my previous jobs, and one thing that we'd do on our job requisitions is list a bunch of technologies that people ""should know"". But, that didn't mean that the candidate needed to know \*every\* technology. We sorta meant it more along the lines of ""some"" to ""most"", but definitely not none.   


Here's my attempt at providing some career guidance this week: Don't let job requisitions scare you if they list stuff that you may not have any direct experience with. That said, definitely be honest with yourself. Don't apply for a position that you know that you aren't qualified for. You're wasting your time as well as the time of our interviewers. But, do not let a long list of requirements necessarily dissuade you from applying for a position that you honestly believe you could add value to.   


The worst that happens is you don't get the position. But, you also get practice tailoring your resume to the job opportunity (yes, tailoring your resume is important) and, if you're called into an interview, you also get to practice your interviewing skills - something that I've found a LOT of people need a LOT of help with.   


tl;dr career advice: Apply for any position that you honestly feel qualified for and don't get scared off if you don't meet every one of the requirements."

How to grow financially?,"Hi Reddit, I'm 21 and working a job that only pays 9.50. I don't even have my first car yet, and dont qualify to finance. I don't know where to take my life to improve it. I am always putting alot of work into my resume to get a better paying job but no one ever calls back. I only have ever had 2 jobs though (lasting 9 months, and my current being just started a month ago) so I understand if my lack of experience is holding me back.

22F College Graduate and I still can’t find a job?,"
I’ve been really depressed after graduating from UC San Diego last June 2019. It’s been months and months of constant rejection. I’ve only get offered jobs from minimum wage jobs such as Target. I graduated with a bachelors in science in public health. I’m starting to realize my degree gets me no where. However, a few of my peers with the same degree has found a job related to health. I also have been applying to internships, yet I never get called to set up an interview. I have previous work experience at an office and I have plenty of volunteer experience. None of these has led me to any job entry positions. Am I doing something wrong? Is it my Resume? The way I type information onto online applications. My lack of skills? My degree? I’m just deeply depressed and I even moved back home in Northern California with my parents and they’re financially supporting me. This makes me feel completely guilty as I’m the first to graduate and I can’t get a job anywhere. Not even the public health department at different state counties will offer me an interview.

I’ve been super down and all of that sadness comes from moving back home with my parents, not having any friends at my hometown, and no money. 

Advice?"
What's a nice way to explain to potential employers that my previous boss abused and gaslit me?,"I'm currently applying for a new job and their online form is asking why I left a certain job. Some of the highlights from this past job:

Immediately after signing me on, the boss said point blank I was under qualified but promised to give me formal training

He actually didn't provide any training and waited 8 months before telling me that I was crap at my job. He started verbally listing all the things I was doing wrong, the stupidest one being that I always played with my hair while working. Note that there was not a single complaint about my work up until this point. 

He said that he had written a list of things I needed to improve on. When I asked for the list, he refused and said that I needed to fix everything on my own.

Finally when he did provide me actual training, he brought in someone that worked from home due to chronic illness and fatigue. After each meeting when this employee was gone, my boss would pull me aside and berate me again for taking advantage of a sick employee. 

This along with several other issues left me so depressed an anxious that when he finally fired me I felt suicidal. 

Now as I fill out this new job application, I'm trying to figure out the nicest way to be honest. Anyone have any tips?"
What are the best trades to get into?,"I'm 15 and realized that I don't wanna pay out college loans untill I'm 40, so I want a career that you don't need college for. I have been looking into electrician and HVAC but not sure if they are for me. What other trades do you recommend?"
"I realized I want a meaningful career, what are my options?",I always wondered why I was never fully happy at my job. I work 8-5 corporate job in business development even though I am given different projects to work on and there is always change. My work doesn't feel meaningful. Our positions only exist to make the company money. My boss also treats lower paying workers like garbage. There's a lot of gossip and it gets on my nerves. I want a more meaningful job where I can help people but I can't stand blood?
How do you stay positive after countless rejections?,"I graduated in May but I've been applying for jobs since March. I've applied to 200+ jobs now and I've only had a handful of interviews and they've all ended in rejections. The biggest blow to my self esteem came this week when I was rejected for an entry level cold calling job, a position I was foolish enough to think was beneath me. How do I keep my head up? I know it's too early to be giving up but every day truly is a struggle. I graduated with a good deal of motivation and optimism but this last rejection really just knocked it out of me. It’s difficult to see value in myself when employers don’t see value in me."
Should i take 30% pay cut?,"I was recently laid off and got an offer with 30% pay cut

I was laid off in February and had multiples interviews including top tech companies but never got any offer. I mostly make it to final round with business plan they asked me to send over but they’d offer the role to another candidate. I felt like being used instead
I’m getting really depressed and doubt myself and just got an offer with 30% pay cut and I decided to accept it just to survive and add to my saving

Am I being underpaid at work?,"Hi all!I'm a project manager and estimator for a mid size contruction company in Boston, MA. I normaly do around $2mm in jobs each year and bring in around $400-600k in profits to the company each year. I am also an architect and design projects for the company to be done as design/build jobs (I've designed a $1mm+ house, a 2 story office building and a 27 unit mix use residential building).

I'm currently being paid $44 an hour without benefits. No healthcare, no IRA, 401k, dental, nothing... I just get a $3k bonus each christmas. That brings my total to around $95k. However... I can't seem to make that income work... I can't find a home that I can afford (everything is over $500k here in Boston and they repairs...) I'm in my early 30s and want to start having a family but we can't afford to have kids right now. I think my salary is good, but not in Boston. I would be more than fine with this salary in places like Texas or Florida where you can find nice/cheap houses.

I've been thinking about asking for a $12k raise but I'm worried it might get rejected, thoughts?

"Feeling Lost. 33 years old, is it too late?","Hey everyone.  Lately I have been on unemployment and I have to say it has really drained my motivation.  Ive fallen into a slump right after getting my Masters degree, partly because after applying widely I have had no luck.   


I spent the last year driving for uber and I found that it was good soul searching experience.  I found out 2 things about myself.    


1.  I love motivating and inspiring others.  The best times I had as a driver were when I was able to motivate an inspire younger underprivlages high school kids.  Weather that's talking about college, or encouraging them to deliver pizza instead of dope.  It really made me feel good and  I was good at it.    


2. Theres nothing like working for yourself.  I ended up putting a lot more hours into work because I was not working for anyone else.    


So my masters degree is in health science.  I wish I could get into a counciling or therapist role with that, but I can not.  Also, I do not have an undergrad degree.. I went to grad school in my jr. year.  Also.. my masters is from a Caribbean school.  So far nobody has given me any grief about where it is from, but I do think I will run into problems applying for masters programs here in the US. 

I would love to be a psychologist.. but I feel like I might be too late.  Im really good at fixing things, I have really good clinical knowledge and knowledge of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology and other medicine related subjects.  I have good computer skills, good leadership skills, good customer service skills, good math skills and can be extremely hard working.  


I live in Seattle right now and while on unemployment I have been spending my time teaching myself SQL.  Its slow going, and I don't even know if I can get a job afterwards.  The other Idea I have is to use my uber income and save up and get a food truck.  Seattle has a big hole for late night food.  hope u have a good day, thanks."
Am I justified to ask for my minimum salary?,"I got my position about a year ago with a starting salary of 50k. About 4 or 5 months ago, I was going through some online documents while rationing out raises (Harsh phrasing. Sorry) for my direct reports. My personal file was available so I looked at it. It shows my min/median/max salary. The minimum is 64k. I was kind of baffled and called HR and they just transferred me around until I got to the head of the department and she said that 50k was the amount they decided on and because I signed the contract agreeing to it, that's the amount that I received. 

I have a few questions. 

Is this normal practice? I can certainly see/feel the economic value of undercutting

Is it justifiable for me to ask for my minimum salary? Or did I screw myself over by not asking for more when I signed on? I've never dealt with this stuff before so any information would be valuable. Thank you in advance.

What I signed was an offer letter. NOT a contract."
Help! Ghosted after accepting job offer?!,"I recently quit my job of 6 years that I loved because I was recruited by another company through LinkedIn who saw my skills/experience and thought I would be a perfect fit for the job as manager overseeing 3 different high volume locations on a high school campus. 

Recruiter invited me to a invite only job fair. When I arrived the HR rep automatically assumed I was there for a ""shift supervisor position"" which is way lesser of a position than I was going for/ qualified for. She said there was only shift supervisor & assistant management positions open. I told her I must have been mislead, and I had spoken to a recruiter on linked in. Only then did she ""check her computer"" & see that in fact, there was a full management position open. 

The interview itself was with the general manager, & I completely nailed the interview. This company focuses on guest service and standards so I answered my questions around that. My district manager from my previous job used to be this managers district manager as well, so I made sure to ask if she knew him in the interview. They did seem worried that I had worked only low volume locations(my companies high volume doesn't touch their low volume), but loved that I had experience as a leader in 3 stores, supporting other locations & had opened a brand new location in the area recently as well. I also had all the management training done, certifications done, & experience training leaders/tms for the district.  I almost expected to be hired on the spot. But was told they needed to get through the rest of the applicants, see how the day plays out & then would get back to me. 

The recruiter reached out to me and asked what I thought. I was completely honest, I told him about the mix up & how the hr rep seemed to judge me based on my age. He said he would figure out what happened because he had spoken prior directly with her & said that I specifically was there for the upper level management position. He basically hinted that I was overqualified. 

The manager reached out to me and asked me to come in for a second interview with another manager. The interview was with both managers. It was extremely laid back and it seemed like more of a meet & greet then an interview. When I explained all the training I had, the second manager asked the first what one of them was- and the first goes ""thats the training you're doing now."" The second manager asked the first if we talked about pay, where the first manager kinda of whispered - well I think that *hr rep* will discuss that. 

2 weeks went by and I thought ok, not happening. Then I get a call from the hr rep apologizing because they realized noone had reached out and then offering me the position. I explained I was still interested but was currently at work & asked if I could call back in a few hours. "" Ok no problem! ""
2 minutes later the 2nd manager calls me and asks if I'm still interested, I told her I just spoke to Jessica & I was, but I was at work and would call back in a few hours. I called back and neither answered their phones, kept ringing. I left a voicemail on one. Noone ever called me back but HR rep emailed me the welcome packet, job offer, etc. The position was for assistant manager (a position lower than I had interviewing for) but salary pay & higher than I was making at the job I was working. I completed all the paperwork (e-sign) sent it in, and asked if It was possible for a later start date so I could remain professional with my employer & give them correct notice. Hr rep replied it was no problem and since I let them know about my vacation during interviewing. She offered I start the day I come back. I said that would be great!

Since noone had called me back to discuss more of the position, I reached out to check about dress code. They said they would order me a shirt & asked what size. I replied back with size & a thank you. Now time has gone by and I am meant to start in 6 days. I reached out the day before my vacation to the 1st manager, Ccd the 2nd manager in, & did not get any responses.... I asked about the rest of the dress code, and where exactly/what time I would be reporting to since there are 3 locations on campus. 

3 days have passed since I sent the email. I'm on vacation at the other end of the country & would rather not make a phone call because the manager speaks very broken English and it's hard for me to find somewhere quiet here. Should I fwd the email to the HR rep and ask for her help? I dont know what to do and dont understand why they are ghosting me😭"

Managers - How To Keep an Outstanding Employee?,"I'm kind of at a rock and a hard place on this one. I have an employee that is a go-getter, very skilled, and willing to learn new things on the fly. The problem is I think she isn't paid enough. I've brought it up with my boss but I keep getting told that my employee has only been here for two years so no bump in pay. I showed data that suggests otherwise but to no avail. I think my employee enjoys everything she does and the people around her. We have a very good working relationship too.

Unhappy in a new job. Is it an awful move to resign after two weeks?," 

Hi Reddit!   


I am in my third week of my first permanent job post-college, and I've realized that this job might not be for me. During the interview process, I was told that my job would entail significant daily human interaction and interpersonal cooperation, which I personally need to be happy and productive. My first two weeks, however, have generally consisted of over seven-and-a-half plus hours of uninterrupted time in front of a computer screen and a few short minutes of small-talk with coworkers -  a schedule that has me quickly becoming depressed in my cubicle. Almost all of my limited work with others has been done via email. Before my hiring, they mentioned to me that there may be ""the occasional day of 8 hour screen time,"" but that it would be the exception.  


I'm seriously considering quitting, as I was just assigned a several-month long project that is not likely to change my work situation. I'm at a loss, because I never envisioned myself in a situation like this, and especially not after so short a time. I don't ever plan on being a job-hopper.  


My biggest concern with moving on is that I fear wasting the resources of the organization that hired me, and I also don't want the HR Manager and my boss to get in trouble for bringing me in and then me leaving so soon, since they were both responsible for hiring someone who would be able to come in and do important things immediately. They are both wonderful people who I don't want to put in a bad situation by leaving.   


That said, this schedule and job are killing me thus far, and I don't see myself staying long-term anyways.   


Any advice is appreciated.

To give an example of what I'm working with, the territory manager is a cold Japanese guy (let's call him Tanaka) who feeds on negative energy and my direct lead is a misogynist narcissistic American (let's call him Jimbo) who has really adapted to the Japanese culture of not being PC at all. He also has an awful temper, talks negatively about everything and everyone and will straight up ignore you if you're below him and he's mad at you or if he's wanting to feel important.

Jimbo's made jokes about cheating on his girlfriend, he's made multiple people in the office cry with his outbursts, he's belittled my ideas and then taken them to HQ without me in the discussion. When I asked him about why he did that, he gaslit me and said I remembered it wrong. He's done so much more, but I will leave it at that for now. Tanaka feeds off of Jimbo's energy and has given a lot of clout to Jimbo for his seniority and knowledge.

Until now, I've been trying to get through and biting my tongue because it's a dream job at a dream company with great benefits. I'm also trying to make it 6 more months before leaving so it doesn't look bad on my resume. However, a recent incident has my blood boiling, and I think I'm at my last straw.

I have been in charge of an event that takes six months of prep. This is the first time I've been fully in charge. We had record-breaking numbers and turnout for the event. Another team was involved in getting speakers for the event.

I was giving updates to Tanaka about the numbers, especially when we passed landmarks. I was expecting a pat on the back or something (he did that for the last person who was completely in charge) but I only got silence from him. I was a bit annoyed at this because he's quick to give negative feedback, so I was hoping for him to finally say something nice...

At the afterparty of the event, Jimbo pulls me aside and says, ""Good job on this event BUT you need to be giving more credit to people. The admin manager (gossipy JP woman) told me you've been taking all the credit"". I was shocked and hurt by this because I had never said this success was only because of myself. I was also increasingly annoyed because Jimbo frequently calls himself the ""One-man team"".

I didn't want to think the team thought I was taking all the credit so I immediately tried to rectify this by thanking everybody for their hard work. I said I couldn't do the event alone, and I also got some nice sweets for everyone. I also wrote HQ with giving the team clear credit for their work, and HQ wrote back saying we did an amazing job (nicest feedback I had gotten that far; was in tears when reading it).

In the end, I couldn't get any positive feedback without a ""but"". The territory manager has been colder to me than usual (I have also been noticeably quieter/standoffish than usual for sure and Japanese people are the most passive aggressive people on Earth).The general admin lady has barely talked to me for the past few weeks which has been awful because she was usually nice to me.

I was going to ask for a raise but the territory manager is so mean-spirited. I'm getting to the point of wanting to leave my dream job. These people have been so awful. I would like to try and work at HQ, but I have had absolutely no success in finding any advocates for me there. I feel like I should talk to Tanaka and see why he's mad at me, but direct confrontation doesn't always work in Japan, and I'm tired of apologizing to these grade A assholes.

Misc. info; we recently had reviews for everyone. I was quite honest (while being hopefully professional and leaving anecdotes out of the reviews). People haven't received their reviews yet and the hammer's coming down on me probably early next week...

I feel depressed and helpless. The most interesting thing about me is this job and I don't know what I would do after this...

Any advice?

Edit: Thank you guys for all the kind words and advice. I'm putting my resume together now."
"Liberal arts degree, thought I lucked out working my way up to getting the “Product Manager” title. All I do is create powerpoints and simple reports in excel. Approaching 30, getting no call backs, under qualified for PM jobs. What are my options?","The PM position I have is at a hardware tech company in the Bay Area, that underpays about 50% under the market rate. I’m beginning to feel the burn financially. 

I’ve sent out applications. I’m clearly unqualified as a Product Manager, so I’ve tried for Program Management or Business Analyst, but not even so much as a phone screen. Given the wealth of talent in the area, I think my lack of basic tech skills or certifications are really hurting me.

Ideally, I’d want to start low and work my way back up to an actual PM position with a real foundation, but this seems like a pipe dream. 

I would love some advice or guidance on what to do. "
"""Turned down"" a job offer months ago and regret it now. What should I do?","I ""turned down"" a job offer by ghosting and I feel deeply regretful now. I didn't mean to ghost, but at that time I was suffering from very serious mental issues that I wasn't able to sleep, talk, or move.

After months of depression I started to feel better and finally checked my emails and voice messages. I found many emails from recruiters sent around a year go, and they were being very friendly without talking about my sudden disconnection, and tried to discuss a new start date with me. I felt so guilty but considering that the emails were sent too long ago, I gave up calling them back.

\- I know in corporate world I am being super unprofessional, but the more I think about it, the more regretful I am. Is there any possibility for me to explain myself? Or is it even worth it to explain myself?

\- If I want to get my opportunity back what excuses I can use? If chances are low what should I do to avoid being blocked by HRs?

\- Do HRs share a list of red-flagged candidates? It's a well-known large company, and I assume HRs in big companies share some ""candidates that you should avoid"" list. Should I really explain myself if I still want to find a job in the same city?

&#x200B;

Edit: It's an entry-level job and a part of the company's training and development program. It's a top tier international company. The office is in North America."
What can a 27F who wasted her time do to start her career?,"I was a very studies person and I graduated from a good universityin India 3 years back. I have a few 2-3 months internship experience and that is all. Just after my graduation I started preparing for an exam full-time, this exam is a big deal in my country. I did that for 2 years , never cleared it. But then I freaked out and decided I needed to find a job. All this while I had a partner supporting me. Earlier this year we moved to a new country which made things worse for me as the field I want to work to (social sciences research/development sector) is very competitive in this region, 9 months and I haven't found a job. I am really not able to make a decision and I am getting suicidal thoughts often. I tried to think about it rationally and here are few options I have.

1) Go back to my native country and look for work their even though it is low paying. (This way J won't be able to support my family, which I really want to)

2)Be patient and keep on searching in my new city. (Even though opportunities are rare, if I make it is will be big for me financially and career wise)

3) My partner has plans to move to again to a different country. (While I would want to follow him for emotional reasons, I am scared the history will repeat, where I will end unemployed again for 4th consecutive year!)

4) Is my career gap a reason why I am not hired anywhere?

Please please provide a constructive opinion/advice/suggestion.
Believe me I am not a lazy ass, I have made a few mistake like preparing for an exam for straight 2 years, wasting my time leaving a huge career gap) 

Any help would been a lot to me, thanks."
I’m calling in sick to my current job tomorrow for a job interview. I’m pretty sure this will get me fired based on my circumstance. Any advice for my interview tomorrow?,"My current role is awful and has extremely high turnover. It’s only a matter of time before I’m canned regardless adding the fact that taking this interview will get me fired from my current role sucks. Either way, how should I approach my job interview tomorrow? I’m sure they will be asking about my current role and if I do get fired Friday the day after my interview won’t it look bad or fishy? Idk the timing of this is very stressful so any sort of tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Possibly relevant additional info: 
- Was told in the beginning June that I had to self something by the end of the week or I was fired. Still here a month and a half later 
- Not hitting metrics and have PTO this Mon-Wednesday for a vacation. 
- Missing an important team meeting tomorrow for this interview. Feel fairly confident I’ll be getting fired when I come in Friday. 

Just to reiterate I’m just looking for some advice for how to approach my interview tomorrow and how/if I should explain my current situation. 

Thanks thanks thanks!!!"
"3 months, >80 application, 3 temp agencies, 6 interviews, nothing. I can't pay my bills this month. What now?","Hey. Thank you for reading.

I have \~13 of customer service/retail. I was a kitchen manager at my last job.

In January, I had a serious medical episode. I collapsed at work. I should have gone to the hospital, but I was too delirious to know what was happening. I got on a bus and made it home. While this was happening, the owner of the restaurant screamed at me. I was out for a week. When I came back, the manager yelled at me in the office until I had a seizure/panic attack and was hyperventilating on the floor, then left me in the office.

After that, I couldn't be in the establishment without panic attacks. I decided to quit at the end of February. They ended up asking me to stay, and I gave them six weeks longer than was my intention. My last day was April 1st.

I promised myself that I wouldn't go back to kitchen work.

Part of the reason that I had medical issue was the physical and emotional stress of the job. I also have joint and back pain. I won't dwell on it, but I just can't do it anymore.

I decided to look for literally any entry level desk work.

I set up a linkdin and indeed account and have stalked craigslist and indeed, looked at neighborhood facebook groups. I had two friends of mine who do hiring help write my resume and the generic version of my cover letter (I customize it per application). I bought professional-looking clothes for interviews.

Three of my interviews have gone very well, and they were encouraging in their rejection letters. The other three were discouraging. One of the better interviews was Monday, and I haven't been formally rejected yet, but I think it's coming. I will follow up on Monday.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. Some of the people who interview me seem to be incredibly impressed by my skill pool (it's varied; though I have customer service, I also have an associates in graphic design, am a published author, and have a few years of entry-level coding experience). The one I just got the rejection letter from heaped praises on me, in fact. They basically told me they needed to interview one other person as a formality. I still proceeded with other applications and interviews, but I can't lie: their rejection feels like a punch to the gut.

Some of the people who interview me clearly don't know why I'm there. Two of the interviews have been with someone who chose my resume and also the person/s who would be my manager/s. In both cases, there was clearly a mismatched set of expectations about hiring qualifications between the two. One woman looked at my resume and literally wrinkled her nose and said '*Kitchen* manager?'. I tried to maintain professional behavior, but I knew it was over.

Financially, the writing is on the wall.

I can make this June's rent, but I am neglecting to pay utilities, medical bills from my episode, student loans (deffered), and health insurance. What's more, my pet has a medical issue. I was able to respond to the first emergency, but it requires follow-up that I can't pay for. I'm also low on food.

\*I guess... what now?"
"I recently applied for a job that requested salary expectations before the interview, and they just emailed me asking if I were flexible with that number... I made a mistake and I see it now, how do I correct it?","NikiI received an email earlier today, as the title suggests. It goes something like this:

>Hi toxic_badgers,

>We are very interested in your resume. Before we continue conversations, I always like to make sure that we are on the same page as far as annual salary is concerned. When you applied, you indicated a salary expectation, yet I wanted to know if there was any flexibility there. (some other unimportant information follows.) blah blah blah, thank you.

My problem is that I honestly low-balled my self and only submitted an expectation like... 2000 dollars more than what I make now...because I didn't expect them to be interested in me... and I am willing to laterally move as far as pay because it moves me somewhere, with a title increase and there is upward mobility (unlike my current position)... But I would prefer not to have to make the same or less money. What would be the best way to approach this?

Edit: i responded with a comment from below and they told me they could not afford me."
I got a Masters degree last year but am working retail right now - at what point will this start to hurt me?,"Hi everyone,

I graduated with a masters degree last year in a field that, ostensibly, is quite employable. However, I'm the last of my graduating class of 25 to find a job in the field. My resume is getting me interviews and I've made it to the last stage of a few different positions. I'm working two different retail jobs right now to make ends meet. I'm almost 27. 

I hate being underestimated by customers (and supervisors) who talk to me like I'm stupid, and if they treat me like that because of where and in what role I work, no doubt some hiring managers will think less of me, too. At the same time, I don't want to leave gaps on my resume, and the places I currently work at are nonprofit institutions that could pique HR's interest and help me stand out from the crowd.

At what point is my entry-level research experience going to hurt me in my job search? Three months in? Six? Nine? 

Thanks."
Feeling a lack of motivation at work. Any advice?,"I always seem to turn to reddit for such questions for some reason. I guess there's something convenient about asking total strangers who don't know you. I really don't know who else to ask about this, but it's been bugging me for a while now.

I've been feeling a lack of motivation at work for months now. I'm not too sure of the reason, but I think I know part of it. Which is, my skill level is way higher than most of my teammates. I always help them, but it's not my job to be educating them about everything, this is stuff they should've learned from their experience. Instead, I find myself constantly having to help people with their tasks, on a near daily basis. This is draining me. I feel like maybe this gap in the skill set is playing a major role in my lack of motivation, since if I'm being honest, I constantly feel like I'm being dragged down. My own progression at work has been really slow for a while.

I really don't know what I should do. Is it simply time to leave the job? Should I just tell my boss that the team needs some professional training? But then again, I don't want my team to think I think they suck. I don't think they do, I just honestly think that their skill level should be higher considering the amount of experience they have. I personally have about the same amount of experience as they do, so I can't find an explanation for the skill gap. Another possibility I'm dreading is that this could be a sign of depression. Could that also be a possibility or does it sound just absurd?

I'd really appreciate any help or advice. Please don't misunderstand my post. I'm not complaining about my teammates, I'm just honestly trying to figure out the source of my lack of motivation and how best to tackle it.

EDIT: Just to reiterate in case this goes the wrong, I don't think my team are bad at their job (even though I truly think some of them could be better), I just think that maybe I also might have worked on my skills a bit too much. Ok I'll say it, there's no other way to put it, I do think I'm good at my job. Not amazingly great, but still good (I did put a great deal of effort though). So I'm also taking part of the fault for this skill gap."
Reposting because it didn't gain a lot of traction: I'm 19 and am in a pickle between school and the military. What do I do?,"So I am currently 19 years old taking summer courses at my local community college after my 1st year at my actual university. After the 2nd summer session (ends about mid-July), I will have 45 credits completed. I am set on enlisting (not going officer) into the Air Force but do not know whether I should do it now (after summer courses are finished), or when I graduate. The tough thing about this situation is that I set myself up to graduate college in 3 years instead of 4 (2022 instead of 2023). The other tough part is regarding the money that the Air Force allocates per year ($4,500) so that would limit the amount of courses I could take along with having to work my job on base.

Having said that, I am having a really difficult time deciding whether I want to stay in school for the next 2 years and enlist after or enlist now and finish school while I am in. I am just barely leaning towards finishing school so that I can work on my doctoral degree while I'm in but, as stated above, this is a really difficult decision for me. I would love any advice from anyone out there. Thank you for taking your time to read this!"
How to politely decline going to my work's holiday dinner?,"I don't want to go to my work's holiday dinner on Thursday. Only problem is I said yes by mistake (felt pressured and wasn't really thinking).  It's a small office of 5 so my absence will be noticed. What can I say that won't piss everyone off too much? I work with a bunch of nosy people and they're going to ask a million questions. I don't like my job and have no plans to stay there long term. Some people might say it won't matter what I tell them then but I have bad anxiety and don't want to deal with any attitude for the remaining time I'm there.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks"

Is it bad form to reapply to a place you turned down?,"Hi all,

A few months ago, I was between two job offers — one with a great company and one for a (massive) promotion at my then-current job. I agonized over it for a few days but eventually chose the internal hire position due to higher pay and generally liking my coworkers. I politely conveyed my regrets to the other company and wished them luck.

Well, choosing this position was a mistake. I've tried to stick it out, but it's getting to the point where I simply can't take it anymore (not receiving enough training, no clear expectations, being spoken to very unprofessionally/made cry, etc.). I've been looking at other jobs lately, and found out that the other place is hiring for another (position I applied for).

So my question — is it bad form to reapply there? I had nothing but genuine interactions with those I interviewed with, and it purely came down to money (of course, I didn't tell them that). Am I likely to be seen as flaky, or have my application passed over for having chosen another opportunity? If I manage to get another interview, what do I even say?

Thank you!"
What are the best career aptitude tests?,"I’m looking for some tests that can help me define what I want in a career and what type of job I would suit.

"Never worked, in my 40s, what do I do? Please help, any advice is welcome.","I need some ""get real"" advice.

What do I do now? what realistic goals should I aim for? educate myself (apprenticeship? University? on the job training?)? does it even make sense to go to uni and risk finding no jobs afterwards because too old? shouldn't I just aim for unskilled jobs until I retire? What should I be thinking or worrying about?

How do I stay positive during the depressing stages of the job hunt?,"6 months ago I left a job with a major publisher due to an extremely unhealthy work environment. I knew the position I accepted was only ""temporary"" while I figured out what it is that I actually want to be doing. However, I've now found myself extremely depressed in this transitional position and I need out. 

I've now been applying to positions that I am very excited for, however the process is slow and we've all experienced the anxiety from never hearing back.

I am a very qualified editor, with 7 years of publishing experience, but the job market is slim.

I graduate HS in June and don’t know what I want to do. Can I have some advice?,"I’m 18 and a senior in high school and quite frankly life after high schools terrifies me.
I’ve already decided I’m not going to college. I can’t stand school, I literally stare at the clock for half the day. Combine this with the fact that I’m just not that bright of a person on must subjects. I’m an average student grade wise (B’s and C’s with A’s in those easy electives).
I’ve never really had a set career that I’ve wanted to pursue. I’m really interested in aviation but I just suck at math and anything science or physics related.
I also tend to be kind of anti-social. I like being alone and private when I’m not in school or at my part time cashier job at a local grocery store. I don’t get invited to the typical high school parties and the such.

Quitting a job with nothing lined up due to mental health - terrible idea?,"Hello all,

I’m at a crossroads and need some advice. Would quitting a job without something lined up be a huge black mark on my record? I’m currently at a job in high net worth wealth management that’s making me absolutely miserable. I love my company overall, but my current team’s culture is toxic and rife with bullies. We’re also working on a soul crushing project through the end of the year which has and will continue to require a great deal of mandatory overtime on nights and weekends. 

I would normally never go against the conventional wisdom to not leave a job before you have a job, but I think pushing through much longer will break me. I’m at the point where I’m having nightly panic attacks due to how much I dread having to go to the office the next day. I’ve also starting having suicidal ideations where I imagine killing myself in the office specifically. I would never act on these thoughts (I think), but the fact that I’m having them at all is worrisome.

I know my situation isn’t healthy, but I’m terrified of quitting with nothing else lined up as I live in a highly competitive and high cost of living area (San Francisco Bay Area). I’m so overwhelmed with the hours I’m working that I can’t even begin to think of applying and interviewing to new jobs, let alone get the mental health help I need. I’m also worried that quitting won’t even give me the relief I’m so desperately craving as I’ll likely be too stressed over being unemployed to fully relax and contemplate what I want. Additionally, I fear the the problem isn’t the job, but me. A part of me thinks I’m just a deeply sad person who will be just as miserable at my next gig, so there’s a chance I would be giving up my career only to end up just as miserable. What are my chances of landing an equivalent or better job if I take time off in order to protect my wellbeing? 

A bit about me for context:

-24 years old - have worked at this company for 2 years. I loved my first team and the overall company culture, but I wouldn’t be able to transition teams until 2020. Company is one of the best names in financial services and has stellar benefits. I’m currently still on my parents’ health insurance.

-$25,000 in non-retirement savings and no debt. Rent is $1,100/month. 

-On track to make ~$100k this year if I stay 

-Graduated from a top 10 university with degrees in economics and Spanish. Decent resume but have only worked full time for two years."
"What are some jobs/careers that offer flexible schedule, potentially work from home (not necessarily), low stress, decent pay (maybe 60k - 80k), and that wouldn't take long to meet the requirements for as it relates to training and/or education?","Right now I work in the medical field. I went to a trade school for what I do and it only took me two years and less than 20k to start out making about 25-30 bucks/hour. I'm pretty much capped off at 30/hour with some exceptions but I'm happy with the lifestyle I life at that level, especially considering that the cost of living is fairly low where I live.

I really like my job. It is low stress, easy as hell, and the time spent in school to money (making) ratio is really good in my opinion. However, the problem is that hours are not consistent for me. My pay fluctuates with patient caseload and I never really know from week to week how much work I'll have. I'm interested in potentially pursuing other jobs/careers and am looking for something that is similar, but that would provide me with a more consistent and dependable income.

What are some options? I know that I said work from home in the title, but that's not a requirement by any means."
Would I be stupid to leave my first job out of college after only two months?,"Basically the company that hired me misled me about every aspect of this job. I was sent to a town (population 400) in the middle of nowhere. A few locations were mentioned during the interview process. This town was never mentioned and isn’t remotely close to any of the places that were mentioned. The offer letter I received had a different location listed on it as well. I was told I’d be receiving paid trips home and per diem. Just before arriving here I was told that employees with my title would not receive per diem or paid trips home.

I work 13 hours a day and I have to work 18 days straight to get 3 days off. I receive no overtime pay or per diem. The 3 days off are intended to be a chance to go home, but much of that time is spent traveling since I’m in the middle of nowhere, and I have to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket to even leave to go home. The closest grocery store is an hour away, and I do t have days off to even go there. I have to go right after work and it’s a 3 hour ordeal. I have to spend an entire night just to get groceries. I’m not getting enough sleep and I don’t have enough time to eat. 

I don’t see how these conditions are sustainable for the next year. Would I be stupid to leave this situation after only two months here? It just doesn’t make sense to me. I could find another job without too much difficulty that pays approximately the same salary for half the work hours in a much better location. What should I do?

Edit: I’m a field engineer. Commercial construction. Hours are typically long, but not like this. I have many friends who work half the hours as me and are paid just as much. Also I have a degree in civil engineering, so there are multiple career paths I could decide to pursue."

What's the reasoning behind paying new hires significantly more than current employees?,"So you've probably already heard about the saying ""if you want significant pay rises, you need to switch jobs"" which means companies. I understand that you as a company sometimes need to pay new hires more to be able to acquire them and I also get that you won't be giving out raises for current employees left and right to keep the costs in check when the incumbents aren't pushing and seem rather content with their pay. But what I don't get is: If an employee is performing well and communicates he's seriously dissatisfied with his/her salary, why would you let him leave and hire a new guy with lesser experience even though you have to pay him an above average salary to attract him and it will take months or even years until he's completely on board and knows all the processes. What's the benefit of that from a company's perspective?"
"New job offers 30% off college courses, plus a $7000/year stipend for courses, not sure what to take or who to ask for help! What do I do?","Started a new job at a day habiliation facility and my employer offers tuition reimbursement and employees receive 30% off tuition as long as they pursue a degree that will help them advance in our agency.

The short list of courses intimidates me a little bit: management (commanding people's respect), marketing (predicting what people want and potentially working in sales), accounting (numbers), and business (which I got away from because I didn't deal well with the type A go getter culture).

So I'm not sure what to take, or even if I want to take anything our employer offers (but I know I should, I can't do an entry level position forever).

But here's what I'm going to do: 

-I'm going to mention to my bosses (who I got off on the right foot with!) that I already have a bachelor's in Psych. I'm going to ask what the best way to benefit agency with my degree and continuing education is and see what they say or see what direction they point me in.

Is that a good plan or is what I'm planning to say too ""on the nose,"" and looking too much like I'm only looking to help myself?"

Till 2009 I was with an Indian Corporate, working in an Indian city. After that I went to UK and did my MA and MPhil in Philosophy. I came back to India in 2017 and since then I am without a job. Things are now becoming bad/serious that I am getting too depressed. Sometimes I do think about ending it all but I want to start my life and seriously don't want to end it before starting.   


I would like to have a one-on-one chat with a career counselor, to know my prospects. Sometimes I think I do not have any prospects at all which makes me so miserably depressed. I can't go on like this. I don't mind paying a nominal charge, but I need help to start/find a job. Is there a place where I can get help? Thank you all!"
Any advice for getting through the time at the beginning of a new job when you don't really know what you're doing and it feels overwhelming and embarrassing and awful?,"I should note that in my case all my new co-workers are being very supportive--it isn't them, it's me. "
I accidentally landed a job with a fortune 500 company. How can I succeed in this strange corporate world?,"What are your tips to surviving in a corporate environment?

I left a job I was unhappy with two months ago for  what seemed like a dream job. 25k annually to 55k salary. Well, that turned into a huge mistake and I was let go after six weeks*.

I felt lost at this point, funds depleted, motivation and drive gone. After a few weeks and countless applications to dead end jobs, I drunkenly must have applied to a fairly high end corporate job in my field. 

Some days later I ended up having a phone interview and a week later an in person interview. There were 6 other candidates, some with 4 year degrees and myself with no degree but some experience with the role.

Long story short, I landed the job...

What tips, advice, or other info can you give on making it in this world? Is a business casual dress code that bad? How do I keep my peaceful, hippy soul from being crushed by country club, jones keeper-uppers?

How do I find a career when I'm interested in most things?,"I'm 16 right now, and it feels like most of my classmates have at one or two interests they are passionate about and are thinking of doing as a career. I was told as a freshman to branch out and explore different extracurriculars as much as possible and I've done that, but now I feel like I'm interested in too many things. I'm not fantastic at any of the things I'm in, and I'm not more passionate about one over the others. Almost every job option that I'm presented with I feel like I could do as a career. I don't hate anything, and I don't love anything. How do I narrow down what I want to do?  

&#x200B;

(I don't know if this is helpful, but right now I'm school treasurer, do sound design for theater, am head of writing club, and am in coding club. My math GPA is trash because of some medical problems freshman and sophomore year, so STEM seems kinda unachievable right now.)"
"Proposed salary cut by 20% due to COVID19, what do I do?","Location: Australia
Industry: Manufacturing
Employees: 450+

Today all employees at my workplace were issued a letter stating our hours are going to be cut back by 20% (work 4 days as opposed to 5). We are required to sign and send back acceptance of the proposal in the next two days.

Is this legal?

The individual contract I signed at the start of my employment states I'm on a salary with a regular working week of 38 hours.

I am in a finance position and I know sales have not been impacted to the extent that measures like this need to be put in place. Maybe the board is just taking precautions, but I can't help but feel they are using the whole coronavirus saga as a cover to cut labour costs for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

EDIT: through my research I can conclude it comes down to the wording of the letter your company provides. If it's a request or proposal to change your hours - totally legal. You can decline to sign and then face whatever repercussions come of that. If the company does not give you an option and adjusts your salaried hours without consent - not legal and you can take the case further if you wish. 

I hope this helps anyone that's in the same situation."
Is it really worth it to take a low paying job in a field I think I might actually enjoy?,"E: wow, can’t believe the amount of responses this has gotten. Thank you all for taking your time to try and offer help. I’ve been give a lot to think about and consider and can’t thank you folks enough.

I’ve applied to a job in a field I’d likely love (pro baseball) but it only pays $30k salary and it’s 2,000 miles away, where I know nobody. I went to school for sport management and haven’t found a full time job in the industry since I graduated in ‘17. I work a shitty job I don’t like that I consider to be a “fill-in” job, where I also make 30k and live in an area that has a much lower cost of living while I search elsewhere. I’m just floating along with no purpose or direction really, applying to jobs here and there in all sorts of different fields...though they all pay more than in sports. And student debt is a mother.

I literally have no idea what I’m doing or want to do with my life! I hope you folks have a good Saturday. 

Oh, and just for clarification: I am well aware and have been since I starting pursuing a career in sports that it’s a terribly low-paying field, especially at entry level. But then I became an adult and found myself actually having shit to pay for, so it all just adds to the uncertainty and indecision about working in sports. Pretending that my dumb ass could even land a full time job in the field (no pun intended), of course."
"My brother is turning down his dream job, how do I persuade him to make a leap of faith?","This is not for myself, this is for my brother, but he’ll never post or ask for help, so I’m doing it for him.

My brother is 18 years old, left school last summer, and has been working in a high end fashion/furniture store as a Sales Assistant. He has been there for over half a year now and is thinking of his next step. He enjoys the fashion industry and ideally would want to continue and grow in this field, ideally into more the Design side than just Retail. Retail is a cool start, but it's low pay, hard work and weekend shifts. Not ideal.

Through a networking event at work he got in contact with a Senior Manager from Chanel, and after asking my brother to sketch a super quick design and talking for a good hour, he invited my brother to a week long trial.

The catch? The company is in Paris, France, and we live in London, UK. My brother loves French culture, listens to French music, but his French is basic at best.

The week long trial would be a working interview of sorts during Paris Fashion Week, which my brother has been going on about for years, for a full time job, again in Paris.

My brother, after thinking for some time, has decided not to go. He feels he isn’t ready and is too young. However I feel this is lack of confidence and nerves talking, this is literally his dream job and even if they don’t hire him after the week, the expense of being there for 1 week is surely worth the experience and putting it on your CV? I also think that since he’s in his first serious relationship, and works with the girl in his current workplace, that could be swaying his opinion, although he denies this.

What do you guys think? Should I butt out or push him to leap for this? I understand he's young, but this company is on another level to others and this could be a one-in-a-million chance.

TLDR: 18yo Brother is turning down his dream job designing at Chanel because they’re in another country and he doesn’t feel ready."
How to stay calm and separate work anxiety from my personal life?,"Hi,
I work as a financial analyst and recently things have been very very high stress. I recently was assigned a new department 3 weeks ago. My director demands immediate & accurate results, while everything I turn in never seems good enough. I’m expected to take ownership of my own work and to figure things out on my own (about the department because my director is fairly new as well and doesn’t have the bandwidth or knowledge of how things were done in the department in the past to answer all my questions). Basically, every night I dream about work and barely can rest peacefully. Even when I nap on weekends, I am scared to check my phone in case I see a message..and whenever I do, my heart skips a beat and my anxiety is activated. I don’t have an appetite at work and I think I’ve lost 2-4lbs in these past 2 weeks. I really want to be able to relax on the weekend without thinking of the impending doom that is the weekday...please, does anyone have any tips on how to separate work and personal life? I’m the type of person who gets fixated on things easily, so it’s hard to be 100% present with my friends/family because my mind wanders back to work. I don’t want to look for a new job yet because this is my first job out of college, and a lot of the positions I see in other companies require at least 1-2 years of experience in finance. And I’ve tried methods of distraction (watching TV, exercising, socializing), but my mood is ALWAYS ruined the minute I see another message from my director, and I lose motivation/joy in those activities. I just want to be able to look at a message and be able to write off any emotion until Monday so I can properly recharge, sleep, & enjoy my weekend."
I got a job after being asked not to apply - how to handle pissy coworker? (XP on AITA),"My 3-streets-over neighbor Leah and I are in each other’s orbits bc we have to be. Both have kids the same age, on the PTA together, mutual friends, kids in the same sports league and school. Never dislike but never warm bonding either. 

Here’s the timeline of what all happened:

April: I was working for a smaller  company and it would have been great except the owner was a total psycho and kept firing people. I started applying for jobs; and emailed Leah with my resume, asked if she’d submit it for an open role at her company. I indicated it was no problem And no explanation needed if she said no. This company is kind of sought-after as an employer and has a decent referral bonus. 

Leah emailed me back. Sorry, she wasn’t comfortable working with somebody she knew. This co has 6000 employees in our city and she and I have very different job functions but whatever. 

ETA: I got fired a couple days later; the owner claimed my resume “was seen” on a job board. 

I shook Leah’s email off and applied anyway. In the last year we’d been granted custody of my late cousin’s 2 kids on top of our 3 biological ones. Not cheap. 

I heard a couple snotty comments from Leah about, “god it must be so embarrassing to be fired” and “job searching is so hard” during the time I was out of work. 

I interviewed, got the job and started in May. Turns out my former employer has himself a bad rep. Yay! It’s gone great for me. 

I didn’t reach out to Leah not wanting her to F anything up. I also kept quiet about getting a new job, where I was working, etc around everybody we mutually know. 

Today: I finally saw her in the company cafeteria. She acted all defensive and creeped out, asked me what was I doing there. I explained I’d started recently and she continued to look at me like one would look at a crazy person screaming on the subway about the apocalypse. 

She asked to see my badge, which I showed her, and then said, “great catching up, see you around!” and went back to my desk to eat. 

I got a couple IMs from her that she felt like I was devious to apply for the job knowing she wasn’t comfortable working with me. I pushed back that our jobs haven’t intersected in 6 months, and that in a company this large there must be other people she knows outside of work - there are at least 3 other parents from our kids school I’ve run into. She pushed back that I should’ve respected her wishes and that she felt I’d deceived people. I responded that I was done with the conversation. 

I did screenshot the convo and sent myself a PDF. I mentioned the incident to my boss, who just rolled her eyes and something like, “ugh, thanks for letting me know. You may have to interact with her department in Q1, so I hope it blows over.”

Any other advice on how to make that happen? I wasn’t an open book exactly but I don’t feel i did anything explicitly wrong."
Company called(?) to reject me and told me I’d be considered for other jobs?,"I went through a lot in the interviewing process for this company. Had a good phone interview, then the next day they called me for an in-person interview THAT day in a few hours. So, I rushed and got everything together and made it to the interview with a few hours notice. The interview itself was fine, more of a conversation. I thought I probably got the job, since how fast everything was moving. Fast forward to today, I get an email rejection. Ok, whatever. Then they CALL me - to tell me I was rejected, as if one rejection wasn’t enough. The HR person said the feedback was really good, but they just went with someone else. And that I’d be considered for other jobs there. So, I said thanks for letting me know and moved on.

Is this normal? Or does it mean nothing? I know normally I just get email rejections, so the standard “your resume will be kept on file” means nothing. But it felt weird for her to tell me that on the phone, if it was just a formality. 

I guess the good feedback is a good sign, I’m just really bummed."
"What's your approach to a job interview, tactically?","What's your approach to job interviews? 

&#x200B;

I'm torn between an on-message politician, or attempting to show how I'd be to work with (which is casual). After a few cringe-y job interviews recently I'm thinking I need to act like the organization I'm applying to is the only place I want to work (in a subdued manner) and have well researched why I want to work there and what project they've completed that makes them compelling to me. 

&#x200B;

What has been your most successful interview tactic? If you're a hiring manager, what do you want to see, or hate to see in a candidate? I'm trying not to overthink things too much but I need some outside perspective here to re-stabilize. "

"Wasted my 20s. Love to work with words, but zero contacts. Where can I professionally go as I approach 30?","I messed up my 20s. 

*Very* long story short, I suffered a crippling depressive episode that lasted for a good year and a half. I got kicked out of school a few months before I turned 20 and didn’t really get back into it until I turned 22. I was so exhausted from my mental health issues (in my early-20s, I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, ADHD, and clinical anxiety, none of which went treated until I was in my later-20s due to problems with my insurance) that I just wanted to get my degree and graduate. 

And I finally did back in 2016. Since then, however, I’ve been bouncing around from dead-end job to dead-end job, unable to accumulate enough experience or good will to puff up my resume. I’ve landed a great job before (incredible benefits, easy work, friendly enough co-workers), but I struggled so much with the “work from home” aspect that I fell behind and, eventually, was let go. 

I’m turning 30 in a few months and I’m at an absolute loss. I’ve felt discouraged before, obviously, but always with a hint of hope ahead. It’s really hard to be optimistic, however, when you’re reaching the end of what everyone calls “the most important decade of your life” and have nothing to show for it. 

**I went to school for communications.** I didn’t have a specific path to take with it; I settled for the most generic BA I could get that didn’t make me want to blow my brains out. **I love to write, to work with words and grammar.** I’m often the go-to proofreader among my group of friends and was even given the side-gig of proofreader/assistant editor at a few of my jobs/internships. 

The problem is that I have no idea what to do with that. I live in SE Michigan, close enough to Detroit to commute, I guess. Despite Detroit having an expanding downtown filled with flashy companies, none of them are hiring for a job that puts emphasis on writing, editing, or proofreading (at least not on any of the job sites, from LinkedIn to Indeed and everything in between). 

There are a few small publishing houses on the west side of the state (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, etc), but there lies the other problem: I’ve never learned how to put together a writing portfolio. I’ve asked my writing professors, but (surprise surprise!) *none of them know.* I’m so glad that what little money I make is going toward student loans I had to borrow for an academic experience in which my professors literally couldn’t offer me the one piece of knowledge I would desperately require after school!

I know I’m rambling at this point, but I’ve been a “long-time lurker” for a while now and I missed a student loan payment this past month due to being unemployed and I’m just picturing my entire fucked-up future flashing before my eyes all because I wasted my 20s. I’m at my wit’s end here, and if anybody would be able to offer a helping hand, I’d be extremely appreciative."
How do I break out of solely Administrative Assistant positions?,"I (31 m) graduated just under a year ago with my BA in Social Welfare. I have been more drawn to training and development roles since graduating, supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives along the way. 

The problem is, the only positions I'm finding are entry level admin work. I've been working in Administrative roles for nearly 6 years now so I don't feel especially challenged, but keep getting blocked from other opportunities. I run projects for other departments consistently, and stay on top of my own tasks while training new hires, and I've only been in my current position for a few months.

The company I'm working for now is not one that I plan to stay at long term because of its toxic upper management. Right now I'm just working on building my resume and getting experience with a few other projects, but it's running me ragged with everything I'm responsible for. Not to mention what a bummer it is to not feel appreciated by the organization. Thinking about getting my HR certificate just so I have another piece of paper to back up my abilities.

I appreciate any advice or insight on how I could get out of this position and make myself more marketable."
Is an employee survey really anonymous?,"Hi friends,

I am working at a big corporate and every quarter, they send employees a survey. Before sending the survey, the CEO always sends all employees an email, encouraging them to fill the survey and be as honest as possible. They emphasize that the survey is (of course) anonymous.

I want to be as honest as possible, but something in the back of my mind tells me not do it. Is a survey really anonymous? I always think it is a sleazy way for companies to filter ""rotten apples"" and fire them based on (of course) other reasons."
How can I improve my job interview technique?,"I've had multiple interviews since I graduated last year, including several for ""dream"" positions that I desperately wanted. Each time I was told I was a strong, well qualified candidate but ultimately they'd decided to go with someone else. I'm starting to feel like a failure, it's been 6 months since I graduated and I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. 

I clearly need to improve how I'm coming across in interviews but I'm not really sure where to start or how to develop these skills. I'm not the most extroverted person by nature but I don't think I show any obvious major flaws like excessive nerves etc. I am worried maybe I'm too understated and have issues selling myself convincingly due to a lack of confidence. I also don't think I'm necessarily good at bluffing questions on issues that I'm weaker on. At the same time I'm feeling more and more anxious that the longer I'm unemployed, that's going to be count against me in future applications. I know this is quite general and broad, but I just had my third rejection in two weeks so honestly any advice would be welcome."
"Job is destroying my mental health, but my current job search is not proving effective. Should I quit without a job lined up?","Going to try to keep this short but I'm in need of advice: 

- About 7 months ago I got promoted to a permanent position in the nonprofit where I work (my first permanent job after uni)
- My boss said she knew this isn't where I want to be but wants to help me get there one day (I've worked for her on/off for a few years)
- I planned to stay for 1-2 years as a building block to where I really want to be 
- However, I'm so anxious and depressed on the job that I've had breakdowns and contemplated suicide many times since October
- Every day from when I wake up to when I go home from work, I feel so anxious that I feel physically sick
- The dread grows every night and I put off sleep because I know I'll have to wake up and go back
- I can't stop worrying about work even when I'm not at work
- The vibe is so negative at the office with bosses always insulting our partner organizations behind their back and talking about how terrible they are which in a nonprofit really bothers me and creates this negative energy that I absorb
- I was told to work more independently but despite my efforts to do that, my bosses are micromanaging and complain a lot 
- Job search is going poorly, no calls back yet 
- I'm seeing a counsellor but can only do so every 3-4 weeks because bosses are very reluctant to give time off 
- I've overheard bosses talking about me and it makes me extremely paranoid 
- Intrusive anxious and negative thoughts and increasing frequency of suicidal thoughts 
- Told myself I'd resign in January if I still felt this terrible but I'm so scared  

So... should I quit with nothing lined up? 
- My bosses take things very personally when someone leaves

- My boss has hired me in numerous contract jobs for a few years now; I'm worried she will be mad if I quit after less than a year / that I'll lose her as a reference

- Job market is tough, worried I won't find a new one

BUT

- Work is so emotionally exhausting that I have no energy to put toward fuelling my job search, and can't get time off unless it's 2 weeks in advance (e.g. for interviews) 

- I've been at this orgo for 1.5 years now (plus used to work there part time on top of the 1.5yrs) 

- I feel unable to function properly and my performance is somewhat poor because I feel so mentally unwell

- Frequent nightmares about work and physical anxiety symptoms

- Trying hard with meditation, breathing, reworking thoughts but it's not proving very successful 

- I'm miserable every day and it affects everyone around me because I'm having difficulty being present in the moment 

- I live with my parents and have very few expenses 

- Everyone I've worked for in the past has been very happy with me, there are probably other people I could use as references in worst case scenario 

- I have a few options of what I could do next, all of which are closer to my dreams/career goals 

Ultimately I feel like my body and mind are screaming out for a change but I'm so scared of the consequences and potentially ruining my career trajectory that I'm paralyzed. I have felt miserable since July so any insights anyone has would really help me - what should I do?"
"I was misled about the nature of the job I have now, and I’m trying to make a change. How can I avoid the same situation?","On paper, the job I have now is pretty much exactly what I thought I wanted to. I’m a death investigator for a county in the US, and I get paid well, I have good benefits, and I get to use my degree on a near daily basis. 

I‘ve been at this job for about a year, and the problem is I’m not getting the experience that’s expected for a year in this field. I have past experience as an autopsy assistant, so I’ve been diverted from my actual job position to fill a personnel shortage in autopsy. Pretty much from right after my start date I was told that I’d be working in autopsy for the foreseeable future and getting training in the investigation division when time allows (time very rarely allows). 

Everybody at my office seems to think there’s nothing weird or wrong about being hired for one job, and then having to do the duties of another. I’m getting paid more than an autopsy assistant would, but the reason I was so excited about this job is that it was a way for me to stop doing autopsies! They’re super interesting, but they’re physically and emotionally exhausting and I’m just tired of it. 

I’ve been applying to other positions, but there aren’t a lot of open death investigator positions around. When I have gotten to interview, the lack (I have done some, but I have to take overtime shifts to do them) of actual investigations I’ve done is a real detriment. 

I’m just exhausted with the situation I’m in and I want to leave. I have applications out for other agencies for similar positions but now I’m worried about the same situation happening... is there really any way to ensure i get to perform the functions for the job title I’m hired for when every job description now has the ‘other duties as assigned’ line thrown in? 

Also if anyone has any helpful ideas of different ways I can take my career, I’d be really grateful for your input. It seems sometimes like all the death related stuff on my resume makes people not want to involve me in their not-death related other business."
"I fucked up, am I about to lose my job offer?","I'm such a fucking idiot. 


Got an offer. Decent salary, in the middle of the posted range, and first job for me out of uni. Was putting off reading through the legalese of the offer but had seen the salary and was considering whether or not to negotiate it (position was supposed to start Monday). Manager calls to see if I had any questions, and I just confirm I'm excited, haven't read through the offer fully but will be coming in Monday.


After verbally accepting I start second-guessing myself and reading online about how I should try to negotiate. So I send an email saying I'd read the offer and wanted to talk about base salary yada yada counter-offer. Except after thinking about it in the past few hours I realized that I verbally accepted and was basically just trying to selfishly get a couple thousand more out of them - and really it's my own damn fault for not looking over the offer and responding before the last minute. 


Anyways then I panicked and sent them an email apologizing for making the counter-offer after accepting, that I'd been building up nerve to negotiate and had a momentary lapse of judgement and was sorry for putting them in an awkward position at the last minute + hoped everything would be okay moving forward. No response yet. How fucked am I? Am I overreacting? Are they going to rescind my offer? How bad of an impression am I making? (everyone else I met with in the company seemed to really like me up until now...)"
Feel like giving up on your dream job?,"This will be long, but I wanted to tell you guys my experience to motivate you! More than a year ago I asked for advice here and some people were so kind! I actually saved some of the advice people sent me and read it when times got tough.

Here is what happened. In 2017 I moved from my home town (ended a 10 year relationship because he didnt want to move with with) because I was hired by a big tech company in another city. It was my dream job, I worked with tech and wanted a carreer boost and an experience in a big company. Five months later my whole team was laid off. Yes. It lasted five freaking months.

There I was, lonely and jobless. I had terrible depression, suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking there was something wrong with me. Maybe I was being punished by my ambition? But anyways, I was in need of a job I went through all my contacts, scheduled meetings with everyone, reached people I never met on Linkedin. Asked for referrals. Finally I was hired by a small start up 5 months after being fired.

But I still wanted to pursue my dream and I kept trying. A friend of a friend who worked at another big tech company offered me to introduce me to someone he knew who worked there. I grabbed coffee with that person who was simply very happy to help me. He referred me, I went through a long interview process and they made an offer!!!

Anyways, just to tell you: I just started at this company and I am way more passionate about the role I am in today than the role I was fired from. I get to actually make a difference now, since I am part of a small team inside this company.

Anyways, DONT GIVE UP! And dont be ashamed to ask for help, contacts, referrals. Go after what you deserve! And I hope you all have the best of luck :)
Edit: sorry for the typos and everything. I am not american and I wrote this very quickly.

Ps: I had no network in the city I moved to. I just kept introducing myself to people and making my way in like a crazy person. Referrals are very helpful, so that’s what I was looking for. Turns out its a numbers game. Some people might ignore you, but there will be someone willing to help!"
Gave two week notice and they offered me an ABSURD amount of money to stay - Too good to be true?,"Been at the same company since I was in college (4.5 years) started off doing payroll, followed by billing/accounts receivable and now I am transitioning into more of an accounting role.  I applied for a job with the state and somehow landed it.  It was a 45% raise, amazing benefits, pension etc.

I gave my two week notice and my boss and upper management were devastated.  They had big plans for me as I was supposed to take over my bosses role but between the low pay and lack of new work being given to me I had to get out.

They offered me an insane amount of money ($90k vs $71k at the state) and they will pay for me to get my masters degree.  My friends are saying this is a no brainer and to take the money, whereas my family thinks the state makes sense given the pension and job security.  

I don't know why I am so skeptical but $90k is such an absurd amount of money for someone my age and with my experience, especially given what I do isn't complicated whatsoever and I can probably do it in 30 hours.  We do not have a 401k which is why the pay is so significant and if all goes well I will be taking over for my boss who makes over 200k with a bonus (2-3 years away).

Am I being an idiot for even hesitating?  My commute is 8 minutes and they basically let me do whatever I want.  Please help me make what is probably the biggest decision in my life!"
Would it be possible for me to change careers at 44?,I am male 44 with an AA degree in liberal arts and currently work for a union grocery store. I am really interested in changing careers. I have done some research on changing careers over 40 and most of what I find online says to use the skills from your previous job to help get the new career. problem is I don't want to work in retail any more. What I want is to find a career that will not require years of going back to school and has a more stable future. I would like to find a web site that has a list of careers that would be good for someone in my situation. I would appreciate any advice any advice you can offer me.
What happens if you leave work before attending your own termination meeting?,"Like for instance, if you knew that your employer was going to terminate you and they come to your desk and say, ""Hey come to my office, we're just gonna have a quick meeting."" And you say, ""I'm actually not feeling well and I need to go home."" What would happen? I am curious from an HR standpoint as I am working on an HR certification and right now, I am reading about releases/rifs/terminations.

WOC: How do you get people to respect you in the workplace?,"I'm a young WOC who just joined the workforce a few years ago. Due to my background and personality, I tend to be a bit more quiet, and my approach is not as warm. I'm good at connecting with people 1-on-1, and I'm good at making small talks, because I'm a genuinely curious person. I think I have a sharp mind and I'm quite opinionated, but I don't necessarily try to prove that. In group settings, I tend to be an active listener and ask questions, instead of voicing my opinions and draw attention toward myself. I basically just hang back and gather information before making comments. I'm learning that this is a big disadvantage, as my colleagues and even acquaintances tend to cut me off or not acknowledge my input. I don't make as big of an impression in groups, and people tend to dismiss or forget about me, which has hindered my professional and personal life. What do you suggest I do to get people to respect me?"
I don't feel like I am intelligent enough for my job should I leave for an easier job?,"I have always lived by the fake it till you make it motto. I was always just chugging along, moving positions, getting new jobs. I feel like my past two jobs I am just not smart enough. I interview well because I used to be a recruiter so I feel they like me because I know what to say, then I am struck with imposter syndrome the moment I start. Even my current boss commented on how out of all the resumes she's seen mine was the only one that was even structured normally, again just because as a Recruiter I knew what companies were looking for....

My last position I was a manager and had 1 person work under me. I only lasted at the job because NO ONE ever checked on me. In fact, since day 1, they handed me a computer at IT and no one ever even told me my job. I got bored of the faking it and really wanted more purpose to my job. I took a job in a entirely new industry and I am really struggling with my confidence in my intelligence. I feel like Im not worth my salary although the same as my last job because I feel like Im not as experienced as they wanted. I was honest not knowing the industry and although I've worked the same role, same title, in 3 other industries, what they want from me is extremely different and they actually watch you like a hawk judging your moves.

I feel like Im put on the spot so much and my mind just goes completely blank. I am supposed to ask questions and I just can't even possess a thought to ask. So lately I have been thinking maybe I really should have stayed at a lower level job. It just couldn't pay the bills so I had to take harder jobs to make ends meet at the time. Im just not smart. I feel like my IQ is just maxed at what it understands. I read a lot, always trying to learn and improve but just feel like I am capped.

I feel like a fraud in my life. Like someone will realize Im not smart and let me go. Even in school, I barely passed classes in highschool and was a D average student. College I did really well and got mostly As and Bs but that wasn't easy. I worked 10x as long to be half as good as the rest of the class. I feel it so much in real life where simple things and intelligent conversations are so difficult for me.

What really spiraled my confidence was being at a bar and just chatting with the bartender and he mentioned how he was smarter than me. I asked how could he tell, he said just by the way I talk in conversation....it was confirming everything I was thinking all along. (We had been talking about 4 hours so it wasn't out of context for our convo)

I've been with my new company now for a month and I just feel fearful everyday they will let me go. I guess I am writing this because I wonder if I should just ""dumb"" down my resume and go for an entry level job or keep faking it hoping no one notices Im actually pretty dumb with no confidence."

My best childhood memeries of him are rising around to his 6 locations on Saturdays. At 12 years old he started working me for a few hours, jokingly ""to pay for my lunch"". At 15 i was a w2 employee. Now my grandmother has passed, my grandfather suffers from severe dementia, and the trust that controls his interests is making my job a living hell. I am very good at what I do, my grandfather used to joke about how he grew gimself a carwash manager, but its time for me to go. The good news is no matter what is next for me I have been forged in fire within a very tough industry. But I have no idea how to put that on a resume 

My job history follows this track

97-00 laborer, washed windows, dressed tires, cleaned towels, vacuumed

00-06 warehouse/maintenance -  Solely responsible for maintaining an inventory sufficient for the day to day needs of 6 full service carwashes and 4 quick lubes. First contact with vendors/suppliers. Pull orders and deliver them in a timely fashion. Also substitute manager and backup maintenance man for smaller issues.

06-11 (the old man sold off all but a few of the washes, so we closed down the warehouse) lube center manager. Hiring, training, scheduling, and maintaining a team of 4 to 5 lube techs. Inventory control, ordering all supplies, staying within budget, competitive pricing strategies, executing promotions and sales.

- planning work schedules, assigning duties, training, employee evaluations, implementing disciplinary procedures and proper documentation

- responding to customer requests, complaints, and damage claims

- maintaining and controlling expenses and inventory, reduce shrinkage, and operate within budget

- developing and enforcing all company policies, programs, and procedures

"My job is NOT what I signed up for, do I continue to voice my concern to my boss or do I take a different approach and start looking for other work?","Some quick background information - I recently graduated from my second undergraduate degree in Finance. For approximately 7 months, I  have been working in a Business Analyst (BA) role for a utilities company and have previous held the same role position for a financial institute (as work experience for my degree).  I have a general idea of the career as I'm currently educating myself in the evenings so I can start my CPA designation as I see myself in an analysis/accounting role. The job market where I currently live is not the greatest so I applied for basically every entry level analyst job I could find and took the first one I could get (for financial reasons, I needed money and I needed it fast).

Here's the thing - I'm an entry level employee and I'm interested in finding a job where I can learn both  from hands on experience and mentoring, but I understand I have to keep my head down and do the mundane ""chore"" tasks that get assigned to me. Anyways, when I interviewed for the role, I made sure to ask questions about mentorship, where my duties would be focused, areas for growth and potential opportunities to learn, etc. The job was laid out to be an analysis role focused on process improvement and documenting, data gathering, interpretation and modelling. Unfortunately, outside the process modelling, I don't do much of the work mentioned above. 

To make matters worse:

1. There is a huge internal company project going on that limits the amount of money that is spent on projects outside of this initiative - basically new work is not exactly going to happen for the next 2-3 years because of this. 

2. My department is split into two teams: the BAs and the Operational Support team (OS). There is a massive growth plan for the support team because the need for the technology support is growing much faster than the team right now - which makes my role feel even more insignificant.

3. My manager has spoken to me about how my role will be shifting to accommodate the support team and I will likely be acting as a tool for them to use when they need to create/model processes or documentation. 

4. My current projects involve developing internal contests (which we are now not going to run), maintaining a website, documenting communication strategies, creating bi-weekly presentations for a stand-up meeting, other small one-off mundane tasks and supporting a technology upgrade (this one actually makes sense and fits scope).

I have voiced my concern, and my manager essentially responded with training will likely be through hands-on only, and your role will be shifting to more of a support role. I don't want to seem ungrateful because I'm lucky to have a job but I have slim to no mentorship, little support from my manager, and it is turning into a completely different job than I interviewed for. 

As you may have guessed, the culture is not the greatest either but that's beside the point. I feel like I'm stuck in a job where I'm learning near nothing, I feel underappreciated and I'm truly worried for my long-term career. I'm young and looking for opportunities to grow, learn and build a career so I'm a little scared I'm heading into the wrong direction and something needs to be done (I just don't know what).

Anyways, I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, I just feel stuck. I'm just hoping to get anyone's advice on this or personal experience with something similar. Do I continue to voice my concerns or is there something better for me to do? Maybe it's at that point where I aggressively apply to new jobs and quit the one I'm in once I find a new one?

I really appreciate it, thank you to any responses in advance!"
"Possible ""Scarlet Letter"" on my profile?","Hello,

Some quick background - took a job in 10/18 that I immediately knew was a mistake from my first day. Been pretty miserable since with the role and BIG company, and at about the 6-month mark a lot of my applications were getting serious consideration, and since I work in a semi-specialized function that is suddenly in demand it seemed just a matter of time till I got a new gig.

Fast forward to June of this year - I interview with a BIG company from June-Sept, 2-hour personality test, 2 convos with Hiring Manager, talk to VP, fly out to the office, and then don't get the job.Ok - was shocked after multiple conversations with the Hiring Manager but I guess something happened in that final interview.

Then another company comes along. Interview with them from August - October and go through 8 rounds and don't get that gig. This included a Hiring Manager who knew a lot of my contacts well and told me on the phone I came highly regarded, etc, etc. and she wanted me on the team. Call from the recruiter - ""sorry""

Another I just heard back from (which i really wanted and took 8 weeks!) did 7 rounds, interviewed with Hiring Manager twice, including 2nd interview where we were vibing and she was talking about me in the role in present tense and 3 people from the team, including the last one who ""I would be working closely with""

Now none of these have done a background check- but I did get a job in 10/18 so I should be good there (nothing has happened to me legally or otherwise). Google search is pretty standard, but I feel like I would be vetted out earlier if there was something negative I'm not seeing.

Im confused why I am getting so close every time - the HM is loving me, interviews go well, follow-up emails, and then suddenly it's like sorry after months of interviews. Not even getting to the negotiation stage. What am I missing?

**UPDATE**

After asking for feedback ...” as I strive to improve my interview skills, whether that was a piece of experience that was lacking or a misstep I made in the interview process, or perhaps a way I can better present myself in future interviews.”

I received this:

“The hiring team enjoyed meeting with you! The candidate selected had more closely aligned experience to the role.”

Which leaves much to be desired. The role asked for 3 years of experience in the field, I have 7... etc.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE II**

Hiring Manager (would be Boss) reached out directly (not sure if it was b/c I reached out to recruiter) but was very nice and wanted to ""close the loop"".  Said I came in 2nd place, basically a toss-up, another person had a bit more experience with a direct competitor. Said it was great to talk to me and the team enjoyed our conversations. Nice bit of closure to be honest. Still doesn't feel great, but better than what I have ever got before and helped me not think I'm losing my mind."
Is it worth learning a language purely for the career aspect?,"I am considering learning Spanish purely for the possibility of it helping in the future.  I am not sure what career path I want to pursue at all and just wondering if I should learn a language.   Is it worth using up precious time to learn purely for a career?   How common are bilingual bonuses?  

Basically, I'm wondering, would it help me earn any extra money on average.   Again, no Idea on what career path I'm going to take. 

Thank you so much for any answers!"
My manager earns $490K/yr while we are paid $30K. What's wrong with this company?,"San Francisco, California

HR accidentally released our manager's W2 so now everyone in the office knows he gets paid $490,000 a year.  This guy plays Pokemon Go all day and doesn't actually contribute, just blows smoke and gets our president (his boss) excited over nothing.  He has been with the company for over a decade and has somehow convinced his boss that he is indispensable, when in actuality he just takes credit of our work. 

The president of the company pays everyone $60,000 a year as base.  Initially, he promised fat bonuses but has failed to deliver for 2 years, even though the company is profitable.  There is no 401K and no salary raise, so my colleague who has been here for 7 years still only earn $60,000 base.  The company dangles a carrot in front of us, saying if we work hard we will eventually be rewarded, and unfortunately the naive new blood buys this lie, which means despite the super high turnover, new grads are still eager to knock on our door.  This just encourages the president to continue his way because he gets away with it.


The job is unfulfilling and involves being deceitful to our customers, so I feel my soul dying a little each day.  The positive aspect is there is no micromanagement, so I am left alone.  I use this time to study and read, and work only about 1 hour each day (it's a 9 to 6 full time job).  The job market here is rough, and with so many of my graduate class still out of work, I *think* I should feel fortunate to have this job, but I don't.  

What would you do in my situation?

"I'm a college student: Tell me about your interesting, fulfilling jobs?","Hi everyone!

I'm a sophomore in college majoring in Global Studies and Economics with a concentration in Middle Eastern Conflict and Security with plans to go to graduate school 2-3 years after undergrad.

How to handle rude coworker?,"I have a much younger coworker who is not handling stress well. We are on the same level but her role is administrative and mine is not.

"5 months in new job, still incompetent - should I quit?","It's been 5 months since I started my new job in a new field (2nd job after uni, 1st job was a diff field). And I feel as lost as when I just started. I feel like i'm drowning every day I come in to work. At times, I just feel like ending it all.

I write for social media, and don't feel like I have the skills for it, or that i'm getting better at it. I want to perform, but because of my lack of skill, as much as I want to I can't. And I feel really bad for it - I don't like disappointing people. I've stayed up nights trying to catch up on work but it doesnt feel like its enough. There seems to be a huge writer/creative block that I cant get over - I cant seem to write or think fast enough.

Honestly I feel like that incompetent fool in the office. And I think my colleagues think that way too, although they've never said anything about it, and they have been really nice so far. 
I've seen them rant about other colleagues before to each other, and sometimes I can see that I frustrate some of them with my lack of ability to apply their advice.

My dad tells me that it takes time to learn the skills, and to stick it out - i'll get better with time. That i'm being too much of a perfectionist, and that i'm thinking too much. Colleague (a friend) who introduced me to job also says that I should stay and not give up so early. But is that the case for a skill based job like writing? I've been struggling since the start... and it doesn't seem to be getting better.

Also, I don't know what other career paths I can explore. I feel like I lack so much intellectually, with no skills (not even leadership or social skills), and where can I fit in like that?  I feel so stuck and lost, I just don't know what to do. What should I do?"
"Having trouble settling into job roles, keep wanting to leave after less than a year is this normal?","Hello All,

To give some background, I am currently 23 and I've had 5 different job roles in the last 3 years. Not all of these have been change of employer, 2 of the 5 have been promotion/relocation to another team. 

My issue is that I can't seem to find satisfaction with the roles I'm choosing. I work in the IT sector and while I have been moving jobs my salary has increased and I am happy with that aspect of my career to be earning as much as I am at my age. 

However, my current job I have been in for 6 months I am already feeling bored and not challenged enough,same as I felt with my previous role where I stayed for just over 1 year, but had promotion in the middle of that time. When I joined my current role 6 months ago the start was very promising there was lots to do, I was given the freedom to innovate and establish processes which is what I love doing. However now I have finished all the important projects, the system I am responsible for is in a good state and I am left doing the boring day to day maintenance which is the part I dont enjoy. 

As a result I have found myself being attracted by LinkedIn adverts and recruiter emails promising better salary for similar/same job I am doing. Issue is, I don't want to be a 'job hopper'. I understand that it looks bad when you have 4 different jobs in 3 years even if you have been climbing up the ladder. Because of that I feel locked down to stay at this place for at least a year or two before I can allow myself to leave. 

I have tried taking onto new projects but the business simply doesn't have the need or resources to start new projects at this point. Am i wrong for feeling like leaving? should I just be ""sitting it out"" for another year and a half? If i was to leave because I have had so many job changes how do I deal with the inevitable stigma that this brings?"
Do employers ever hire slightly “overqualified” people who are willing to do the job to restart their career?,"I’ve been out of university for 3 years. Graduated with a finance degree. 

I have 1 year of finance intern experience, and 2 years of non finance full-time experience. This makes me a little overqualified for entry level finance jobs, so ive been told, but I am willing to take a pay cut and a lower job so I can restart my finance path. 

Is this ever acceptable to employers? I’d be happier with a lower pay working in the industry i WANT to be in, under a organization I enjoy. My current job is deadend and I took it as it was the first paying offer...maybe that was a mistake"
I keep changing jobs and I love it... but should I?,"I switch jobs quite frequently. My first post-college job I was there for 2 1/2 years, my next job I was there for 1 year, and after that I've only been working at this company for 6 months and I'm already ready to move on. I've been making large salary jumps and I make a lot of money for only being 25 years old, which was always a big reason I would change jobs. But I also get very bored at different jobs very easily. Additionally, all my job changes have been in-line with my career goals.

That said, even though I *really* enjoy starting at new companies and enjoying the challenges that entail those changes, I also feel guilty for not keeping the same job for at least a couple years. Can someone help me with how I should feel about this?"
"How can I earn 50,000$ before going to university?","I am currently in highschool(a-levels) and recently turned 18. Only 1.5 years are left before I leave highschool and go to uni, and I want to earn as much money as I can so i can reduce the burden on my parents.

Currently I am living in a south Asian developing country, and these are things on my resume;

Interned at a marketing company for 3 weeks
Participated in several business competitions 
Freelance Photographer for Istock and ShutterStock

 What should I do to earn over and above 50,000$? Or even slightly lesser?  What skills should I learn and what jobs and internships should I do?"
How should I respond to this promotion ultimatum from my boss?,"A little background: In late 2018, my partner and I were planning to move across the country because 1) we hated our jobs 2) our landlord told us he would not renew our lease and was selling our building and 3) the train line we live off of was supposed to shut down the following year. 

That month I ended up accepting my current job through someone in my network with total transparency about my plans (the company said they didn't care if I needed to leave four months in). As life had it, our landlord changed his mind about selling the building and the city decided not to shut down our train line.

I've now been at my job since October 2018, and my boss (the one who brought me on) was fired in June 2019.  Since then, I've been handling all of her duties and been a de facto member of our company's C-suite, without any raise, promotion, or official acknowledgement. Including me in these conversations resulted in me leading two company-wide primary initiatives that have turned the business around.

I've repeatedly asked for a promotion, and finally my CEO/(new) boss has told me point-blank that he won't give me the promotion unless I agree not move in 2020.

Meanwhile, my partner still hates his job and we both feel we'll want to finally move next year (we'll likely start our job hunts next month and hope to move by midyear).

I feel frustrated that, if I'm honest with my boss, my resume will show zero growth and I'll have been doing a C-level job without compensation for almost a calendar year. If I lie, I'll burn a bridge with my boss and force some of my colleagues (who I care about) to endue some chaos if they restructure my team and then I immediately leave. 

My partner said it's business and I should lie, but I'm a terrible liar and hate the idea of screwing anyone over. Any advice is much appreciated!"
Dealing with a passive aggressive colleague at new job is making me sick - help?,"Another night since starting my new job where I am losing sleep at the thought of going in. I sit next to a colleague who has never been welcoming since the day I started despite me making the effort. The didn’t want to train me, made jokes at my expense and was just passive aggressive. Nice to everyone then when it came to me said colleague would have the stiffest face ever. Their behaviour influenced even the most junior members of staff who had zero respect or patience for me.

I’ve raised my colleagues behaviour 3 times now with my manager who agrees he is difficult. However our team head is very close with this difficult colleague and I don’t believe he is doing anything given they are close. First time I raised this the team head said to my manager they would wait until my difficult colleague raised the issue with him. That’s when I started applying for jobs (I send 3-5 a day). 

Needless to say that this colleague has a lot of social power and I’ve found settling in to this new team INCREDIBLY difficult and toxic. I dread going in at times and don’t know whether it’s best to quit and just job hunt after but it’s not so wise as I don’t have the financial means to do this. The last two months have been intense. Everything at work seems to be going wayward when I touch it or there is a problem when I do something that is out of my control but may create the perception to the masses it is me. 

I fucking hate this job and wish I never took it.

Edit: spoke to difficult colleague about it first time. I would’ve been a month in role. Said colleague admitted to their weird wats but said it wasn’t personal. Then admitted to my team manager they had received this feedback before with the colleague I replaced. Management are aware."
"Boss is asking me to do something totally unethical, and I can’t bring myself to do it. Should I leave?","Hey all. I started a new job a few months ago, and I really like it. Pay is great, company is high growth and it’s really fun and interesting work. However, the CEO has made some very questionable decisions since my time here, and it’s clear he only surrounds himself with yes men. Recently, he asked me and a colleague to do something totally unethical. I can’t go into any detail because honestly I shouldn’t even know about this - if it comes out, it will destroy our company in the press and destroy all of the goodwill we’ve cultivated with our customers - but let’s just say we have to use fake emails and fake names to complete his request.

I’m pretty high up in the company - my boss reports directly to him, and while she agrees it’s not a good idea (after i explained why), she’s still asking me to move forward with it. I told her when she gave me this project that I wouldn’t do it, think it’s a horrible idea/awful thing to do, and don’t want to put my name on it at all. Her response was to not say I think it’s a terrible idea to the CEO because he’s already defensive of this project, and that if shit hits the fan, I can always walk away. 

I can’t do this, and don’t think there’s anything I can do to change my boss or CEO’s minds NOT to move forward with this (my colleague who has been assigned to the project feels the same way that I do, if that matters). Even if they don’t make me do it because I refuse, I fear they’ll either fire me or make my life hell. 

Do I resign? Has anyone been in a similar situation, and how did it work out?

EDIT: Just wanted to thank everyone for their advice on this thread. I know I didn’t give any details and it’s hard to give good advice without all the facts, but I really appreciate the time people took to help. I am going to heed everyone’s advice to document all communication, and refuse the request in writing tomorrow. I realize now that requests related to this project have been via phone or face to face meetings, which leads me to believe that higher ups are covering their asses. I’d rather be financially uncomfortable for a bit than to compromise my morals. I’ll be sure to post an update once this all plays out.

Also, since a few people asked - I don’t know if this is illegal because I’ve never seen another company do this before, and there isn’t a lot of regulation in the industry I’m in. But it’s DEFINITELY unethical."
"Left banking job on bad terms after 6 years and have done nothing for over a year - how to approach CV, recruiters, etc?","Hi,

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the ""external perspective""), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the ""personal perspective"" below. I was thinking of simply saying ""personal/family issues I had to deal with""

&#x200B;

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we ""parted ways"" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

&#x200B;

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my ""leave"" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now. I've finally found the motivation to get a damn job so today is literally the first time I've logged into LinkedIn in years!"
What are some careers that people can honestly say they love doing for a living?,"""Love what you do and you'll never work a day in your life"" (insert fart noise)"
CRAZINESS OCCURRED ON FRIDAY. What would you guys do in my shoes??,"HEY. I'm going to speak in short sentences to be as concise as possible. Let's go:

25yo male. Bachelors in management, MBA in business admin. Working in healthcare for the past 3 years. Year 1 was an IT analyst (basically just desktop support). Year 2 was IT manager (more desktop support, telling specialists to handle tickets, meet with heads to see if IT could help, nothing special tbh). Year 3 (now) I am an account supervisor for another healthcare company. They are all about enrolling doctors, nurses, and other healthcare providers into insurance plans. I just make sure my team of 7 completes their tasks and sends out those applications to enroll providers. Nothing special again. I love IT because I love fixing shit and researching new processes, so this job kind of sucks because its very... ""lame"" to me. **OK NOW THE CRAZY PART BEGINS. You need to know the aforementioned into before proceeding:**

Director pulls me in on Friday. Has a piece of paper in her hand. She's smiling and looks at me and asks ""can you explain this?"". I look at the paper. Its my resume which I LEFT IN HER PRINTER SOMEHOW. FOR AN INTERVIEW I HAD EARLIER THAT SAME DAY. I mention straight up that im interviewing. And that its for the money. Really. I said it straight up. She laughs and says she completely understands. She asked how much they offering. I said 75K. I'm currently making 60K. I also tell her my 2 hour daily commute is brutal. She says she'll talk to the CEO and get back to me MONDAY (the next business day). 10 MINUTES AFTER THIS CONVERSATION, she calls me in and says we would like to offer you 75K to stay, and up to 2 days to work from home.

Guys, my mind was blown away. I have this job that I am not passionate about paying me a very nice amount (and its very easy - almost a joke), while I'm here looking for something in IT because well... I like IT. But now I'm thinking if I should just stay.

SOS  
  
**UPDATE^1:**  The other company has offered 73K. My current company is offering 75K + WfH. Welp.  
**UPDATE^2:**  Next day. Leaning towards staying. Think I should push for more money???

What to do about a job causing depressed mood?,"My job is really starting to impact me mentally. Not my usual happy self. However, I am so close to bonus time and while not guaranteed one I did get one last year so fingers crossed. So I am unsure of whether to look or stay? I do have a major life event next year and don't want to make too many changes. In addition I feel the devil I know is better than an unknown. What should I do?"
"I hate my sales job, but I also think I just hate work so what do I do?","I never truly knew for sure what I wanted to do. At first a teacher, then a lawyer, then an events planner, with little roles and jobs in between from college til now.

A little over a year ago, things just got too toxic at my previous position within a non-profit organization. I had made my way to Special Events Manager, but did not get any additional compensation and was still expected to be a fundraiser, which is essentially a sales role without commission or bonus, because I was good at it.

So I said “Fuck it” and took a sales role at a huge company in NYC. I had told myself for years that I hated sales. I don’t want to do sales. Sales is stressful and unpredictable and I hate conflict and confrontation which is a large part of sales.

So I’ve been in this sales role for just over a year now. And I’m good at it. I’ve consistently been a top performer in my team. I’ve had my ups and downs, but mostly ups. This quarter however has been difficult and it is of course a quarter in which I am up for promotion if I hit my quota, which I’m very far from as is everyone else in my department due to overextension from corporate.

And I don’t know if I feel depressed because it’s just been difficult. It’s felt like everything that could possibly go wrong has been going wrong. I’ve been trying to be more strategic. Prospect my clients before calling. Be more aggressive. Be a better professional. But everything has been crumbling.

This is when I thought about the last year and wondered how I felt before things started going south. And upon reflection... not good. Even when I was excelling in my role, I was going home and drinking a lot of days. Difficult clients. Pressure from higher ups. Refund requests. I think the stress from this position has been killing me emotionally and physically more than I’ve been letting on.

But I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any job ideas that I think I’d be good at. I can deal with a pay cut, this job was never about the money, but I also need to pay bills, especially if my fiancé ends up going to law school as she plans to.

I’m developing phone anxiety which is a death sentence for a phone salesman. I can’t stand the idea of doing this job any longer when I just want to enjoy my life outside of work without dwelling on the problems I have in the office, which I do a lot.

I am now going back to therapy to deal with these issues and see how I can manage them because right now everything points to me throwing myself in front of the train that normally brings me to Penn Station (I’d never do that to my fiancé, but FUCK do I want to end it.) When things were going WELL I was killing my feelings with weed, vodka, and sleeping pills. It’s not much better now that things are shitty.

So idk what to do. Do I quit and find a less stressful job? Do I suck it up and see if this feeling passes? Do I go off into the wilderness because I’ll never be happy as long as I’m working behind a desk? I’m fucking lost. And unhappy. And I just want to enjoy my life without worrying about my livelihood being tied to something I hate so much."
Horrid Job Search Experience anyone?,"Recently had a horrible time finding a new job. Can anyone else relate to this?

I have over cumulative 15 years of sales and sales management experience. I had been looking to switch industries and began searching on all the typical job avenues i.e LinkedIn, monster, career builder, zip recruiter, directly on companies website. 

I was shocked to see how dehumanizing the whole process was. 

You see, prior to me thinking about switching industries, all my previous jobs were obtained by referral. Those interviews typically were 1 day interviews with the job offer presented within 3 business days. 

But WOW, what a wake up call, the job search grind was REAL!  The time wasting  waiting to hear anything back became the norm. I’ve had 2 emails from companies, the first auto response where they acknowledge you’ve applied and the second email comes in 3 months later also an auto response saying how they chose someone better than you. 


Anyone else have a similar experience finding a job?"
Thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn updated while you’re working at a company?,"TL;DR: coworkers are cracking jokes and judging me for marketing myself on LinkedIn. It’s become pretty obvious that I’m doing it because I’m looking for another job. What are your thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn up to date while you’re currently working at a job?

I’ve been at my current company for about a year now and I’m looking to relocate to a new city and find a new job there. Of course, nobody at my current company knows that I’m trying to find a new job, but I’ve been doing everything I can to make myself a better candidate in the meantime.

I’ve been updating my LinkedIn and trying to make myself more marketable by adding a professional looking headshot as my profile picture, updating my work experience with some bullet points about my work, and writing a cheesy bio about my skills and what I love about my industry. Also I’ve been getting some certifications through LinkedIn learning and adding those to my profile as well.

Some of my coworkers have seen the changes on my LinkedIn and tease me about it. They make jokes about how it’s suspicious that I’m putting so much effort into branding myself and they hint that I’m trying to leave the company. It’s really starting to get annoying. Yeah, I am branding myself because I’m looking for a new opportunity, but they have such a negative and condescending tone about keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date. They make it seem like anyone who cares about their LinkedIn image is a traitor to their current company.

I think that’s really annoying because now that I’ve taken time to update my LinkedIn, I realized this is something I would do even if I wasn’t considering leaving my current company. If you’re in any type of career, your public image is so important now that the internet plays a huge role in everyone’s lives. Any single person you meet can take 2 minutes to look at your LinkedIn and learn a lot about you, and I think that’s really underrated. 

I hate how I am being judged so negatively by my coworkers for updating my LinkedIn and marketing myself as best as I can. Yes, I admit they’re right about me doing it because I’m looking for other opportunities, but i don’t think updating your LinkedIn in general for the sake of keeping your career progression up to date is such a bad thing. It’s such a taboo subject in the workplace and I really don’t think it should be. "
Has anyone been able to preserve or repair their job and work relationships with their boss after mediation?,"So I’m now in mediation which means I can no longer discuss the specifics of the case, but I am wondering if anyone here has gone through mediation and if so, what was the outcome? Were you able to preserve your job? What was your relationship like with your boss/coworker after the mediation? Did you ultimately end up leaving the company anyway due to the awkwardness and strained relationship following the dispute? What was the actual mediation process like and were you truly satisfied with the outcome?

How do I make a career change when so few of my current skills are applicable to my desired career?,"I want to change careers to a marginally related field, but it’s just out of reach

After doing some intense soul-searching and reflection, I realized that I want to work in environmental policy and be a policy analyst. Based on what I’ve read, it seems to fit my interests while also being extremely fulfilling. I love the idea of constantly learning new things, solving problems by using that critical thinking part of my brain, and contributing to the protection and wellbeing of the environment and vulnerable populations. 

My issue is that my current career has not provided me with any relevant skills to make this transition. I’m working as a medical laboratory technician in a clinical lab. I have my BS in Biology, which isn’t completely unrelated, but it’s way too far to have gained any relevant skills or have taken classes useful for a policy analyst job. Literally none of the skills or education that I gained while in this current job are applicable in a policy analyst career.

I’ve been volunteering with a local environmental nonprofit for the past 6 months in hopes to eventually get hired. I’m slowly gaining some of the skills there and I want to take some of the proper classes to be a better candidate. However, I feel like that could take a lot longer than I originally anticipated, and I want to make sure I’m making the best use of my time to get out of my current job and start moving toward a more fulfilling career. 

Has anyone made this huge change? How did you go about this?"
I love my job but want extra job security. What degree is generic enough to open doors but specific enough to be looked as beneficial?,"Sorry the title is painful. Right now I’m an analyst for a large insurance company. I work remotely and absolutely love the company and the job. However, I don’t feel all that secure in my job as you just never know what could happen. (Lay offs- and since I’m remote it’d be difficult to apply for a replacement role) 

My experience is great but I don’t have a degree which would stop be from being considered.

Anyways, I’m looking into going back to school. I’d love to stay within the company should something happen. The one degree that seems to fit where I’d like to be is communications. I love creating guides/tutorials/training materials and I feel like that degree fits fairly while. Another option is something generic towards business. 

I read somewhere that communication degrees are looked down upon because they’re one of the easier degrees to get. Is this true?

Also- even if I wouldn’t end up staying with the company.. how do other companies view degrees. Which ones are looked highly at and vise versa?

Edit. To add- I don’t want to stay in analytics. Ideally I’d like to work in a more creative field such as project management or design."
What careers offer a decent salary with little to no stress?,"Recent marketing grad here working in finance relates sales. Ever since I started full time at my current job I haven’t really felt like myself. I hate the pressure put on me to perform and I feel that it’s slowly killing me. I’ve noticed that I’m a lot more anxious and I have started relying on alcohol more often. I’d like a position with safety where I can just come in, do my job, and leave without all of the meeting quotas bs and constantly putting on fake smiles. What are my options?"
Who succeeded in doing a career they were initially not suited for? What is your story?,"English teachers and history professors used to sing praises about my work. Science and math teachers ignored me. 

I was clearly somebody who was suited for liberal arts. I read a new book every morning and debated Shakespearean history in the evening.

But I decided to be something else.

I was accepted to a university as a transfer student for marine science by the skin of my teeth. Ever since I got my acceptance letter, I swim every weekend, sail every other weekend, and study my old science textbooks. I am relentless in making this work because I love what they do, whether it's outdoor research or being cooped in a lab working on a paper.

So Redditors, what's your story?

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! You guys are absolutely inspiring, and I hope to take a page out of your books to continue to make progress on my new path :)"
Is it a valid reason to resign due to a toxic work environment?,"My manager has never had an issues with my performance or attendance. I have stayed with the department because it is in the industry related to my career interests, the job market is rough and I needed experience.


I am exhausted from being targeted by co workers and working in an environment where I'm made sure everyday that I am not welcome. I filed a harassment complaint with HR and everyone was required to complete workplace harassment training. I am tired of documenting.

Management is rejecting my requests to become part time or taking leave of absences. I cannot continue to work in a poisoned environment. I don't have another job ready (even though it would be ideal). 

I hate that there will be a gap in employability and
its obvious that I have to leave but I'm hesitant:
- should I state my reason for leaving due to toxic environment (edit: lack of fit), detailing everything I've done to resolve the situation without any luck. 
- would management and hr provide references for my future employment?

Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight. I did what was best considering my circumstances. This is a learning experience in my career development, I'm also networking and also learning from other experienced professionals as well as upgrading my skills. "
"We all know of “first date tips,” but what are your “first day of work tips”?","I’m sure we’ve all heard the common “tips” for first dates: don’t bring up your ex, don’t text, and avoid messy foods. 

**What are your tips for a first day (or week... or month) of work?**

Can I talk about my former employer during my first week? How do I remember names? Is it ok to eat lunch alone (by choice)? My workplace’s dress code is super lax... should I go fully business professional the first week?

Just wondering what your “tips & tricks” are when starting a new job!"
I'm told that my boss needs to edit my emails before we send it to anyone vertically or outside the company. Is this normal?,"I started a job about 3 months ago at a hospital. I've run into a very strange situation (or what I think is strange anyway) at work. To preface, here is the ""cast of characters"" if you will:

Physicians at the hospital

Companies we work with as clients

I have two bosses:

Administrative Director

Clinical Director (a physician)

Their boss is: Executive Director (of the department. And above him are higher ups like VPs and CEO of the entire hospital and such)

I am a project manager and my job is to work with hospital-to-industry relationships on behalf of other physicians trying to get funding for their studies. An attending physician asked me to help me with a new company relationship. As we were wrapping up our conversation, he said, ""I think we should all meet together so you, myself, the clinical director, and the executive director are all on the same page and there is no confusion. Could you set up a meeting for us?' I went ahead and sent an email asking if they would like to arrange a conference call. The clinical director (one of my bosses) said, ""Oh yeah, of course. I think that's a great idea.""

Fast forward two days later, I have my weekly check in with the administrative director (my other boss). She's not happy. She says, ""you need to be careful about who you speak to and can't just go off the rails setting up random meetings by yourself."" Apparently, the executive director forwarded an email to the administrative director saying, ""What is this and who is this guy? Can you take care of this?"" And I told her that the attending physician asked to set the meeting up - I didn't realize just asking about people's availabilities would cause such a commotion. Now my boss (admin director) wants me to draft up a report telling her where everything went wrong so she can ""sort this mess out."" She also says she wants me to send her drafts of all my emails before I send it to anyone vertical in the hospital or to another company. In frustration, I spoke to one of my coworkers about the situation (they work in a completely different capacity). They said that's very common and they were told the same thing too by their bosses.

Is this normal?

EDIT: Some people are asking if I reached out to their admin assistants. I did not but I said I'd be happy to reach out to their admin assistants if they were interested in holding the conference call. I didn't reach out directly to admin assistants first because I figured admin assistants wouldn't know the context of the meeting as to whether or not it was worth scheduling one in the first place. My train of thought was more like, see if the ED even wants to talk, get the thumbs up from him, then go to his admin assistant to schedule something because he wants to discuss this matter. I would hate to schedule something, have the ED to come to a meeting, only for him to be like, ""Well, that was a waste of time."" You know?

EDIT: This is borderline naive, but I'm gonna be honest. I thought in a professional work environment with a carefully crafted email that dealt with a minor issue like scheduling, especially when directed by a director-level attending, the worst that would happen is, ""I'm sorry, who are you?"" and people would move on with their lives. No matter how high of a seat you hold. Because, I don't know - people just being kind to one another?

As for my admin boss, I get her embarrassment, but I thought the worst she could be like, especially in a position of a mentor would be, ""I mean, shit sucks man. I get it, but don't do it again."" End of story. Not write a full blown report about the ""mess you've made.""

Little did I know."
My boss said I’m too smart for my job. Does that mean I’m going to get fired?,"I started a new job 2 weeks ago at a very small company with four employees. On Friday, my boss (the owner of the business) pulled me into her office and asked if I was happy there and elaborated that she thinks I’m too smart for this job. I’m really worried this means I’m going to be fired because I’m being cross trained to do every role in the business so there isn’t any additional responsibilities she could give me. What do you make of this?

Edit: Truly, thank you for all the advice. It’s been making me think about some things. One thing I’d like to clear up is that I graduated with a useless BA from a liberal arts college and that I quit my last job that I had more responsibilities at without having anything else lined up. So I definitely think that I’m lucky to have found this position because I wasn’t getting offers anywhere else."
How do you stay motivated when you job hunting isn’t going your way?,"After applying for hundreds of positions and been interviewed several times, they say that they will call you and you waited weeks and never heard back from the company that you applied. How do you stay motivated when you job hunting isn’t going your way? "
Is 29 too old to go back to school to change careers?,"I'm currently employed as a personal care home administrator and as bad as it might sound I just don't find the work fulfilling on a personal level. 

My plan is to go back to college to get an associate's degree in engineering technology. My biggest concern though with going back while working a relatively demanding job is that I'll only be able to mentally and financial manage 1-2 classes per semester. To get my degree I'll need to complete 15 classes so I would be looking at minimum 8  semesters. 

This would mean I'm not going to be able to even start applying for jobs before I'm 33. Do you think it's worth the time, money and effort or should I look to just pivot from my current position to a different job where my developed skills would be found useful?

Any advice is greatly appreciated,
Thank you.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your great advice and encouragement! I'm going to take all your advice to heart and go to my local college tomorrow evening (placement office only open until 7pm Wed and Thurs) to apply for the spring!"
What does it actually take to move to and work in Ireland?,"With all the crap going on in our country I would love to know my options. Has anyone been successful in relocating to another country for work in the semi recent past? For reference I do marketing, so not some super high demand job like engineering or anything. I've been doing agency work for over 5 years now and specialize in digital marketing (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn ads, etc)"
Does my degree define the rest of my life?,"I'm 21, have 2 years of university left to do, about to pursue a useless degree... but I don't really know what I want to do. No matter how much I try to explain it in short, it sounds pathetic. So here's my long explanation:

-Not knowing what I wanted to do, I was just going with the flow - went to business school straight out of high school, got depressed and was only able to do one semester (though I did well in the classes).

-I then applied to a different uni the following year to pursue Education. I do enjoy working with children but to be honest, I only did this to have a sense of security (a clear-cut career path) but all I had in mind was to eventually move out and teach English in Asia (SK or JP). You don't even need a teaching degree for that. Why I want to try living in a different country is, I constantly feel suffocated in my city and feel like there is so much more out there I could be doing. Anyway, I enjoyed taking my foundational/elective courses until junior year (this year) came and was constantly stick to my stomach at the thought of being a teacher here at home. I kept trying to convince myself to stay but I really didn't like what I was learning anymore and I was already dreading the thought of having to do practicums throughout my last 4 semesters. Being a teacher here (was an early childhood major too) was obviously going to be different than teaching only ESL. Eventually, I had to withdraw from my classes as I was having major depressive symptoms again, 10x worse than when I went to business school.

-I'm now taking the semester off to rest and work on my mental health but hoping to go back for a BA in Sociology in January. The motivation behind this is that: 1) all the classes I've done will not go to waste/will get credited 2) I've taken many classes on it and have always found the field enjoyable and interesting, but initially could never choose it as my major as I was worried about my job prospects here at home (STEM, healthcare, business, or die), and 3) really just out of obligation to finish the last 2 years of what I've already started. But then again, I'm in this constant loop of not knowing what career path I want to pursue <-> being afraid to pursue a major I enjoy but not knowing where it can get me long term. I'm still planning to teach English in SK for a few years because you can do that with any degree, but that's obviously not a long term career plan.

-These days I wake up with morning anxiety and I either gradually start feeling better throughout the day, or it just stays with me the entire day, my heartbeat constantly faster than normal. I feel like my anxiety is to the point where it is excessive - sometimes I would just feel empty and have no hope for the future. It doesn't help that I keep pitying myself and even wish I could just disappear and stop being a burden to my family (probably a huge motivation as to why I want to move to a whole different country). My family isn't the type to pressure me to do what they want, they just want me to finish something in school whatever it may be. Being Asian there's also no pressure with moving out ASAP or see anything wrong with being, say, 30 and still living with parents, that's a very western way of thinking I've realized.

-I would also like to mention that while I don't know what traditional career path I want to pursue, I have side hobbies that I've been doing since my first year of college. I am a YouTube content creator and thankfully, it hasn't exactly flopped and to this day I continue to make videos almost every week. I've started making money off of this but definitely not enough to become a career (at least not yet).

Ahh I don't know where I'm going with this anymore. I guess I'm trying to seek reassurance that everything will fall into place or that I can always go back to school (pursue grad school which is usually ideal for BA holders, get a certificate on something I like if I do find what that is, etc.) when I come back from teaching abroad (if I will even be back), or seek a professional's help because maybe my issue is more than just feeling lost in life but also a mental health issue idk. As I'm only 21, I know I have all the time in the world but many people my age are already achieving more than I do - there I go again with comparing myself to others. :(

Reddit is a place where there are people from all sorts of age groups so I would very much appreciate insight from a variety of you - people with experience, people who have changed careers, graduated and are not even doing something remotely related to their major, went back to school for a certificate in something completely unrelated, only found out their ""calling"" in life at 40, etc.

Edit: I think it would be best for me to take advantage of my financial dependence now and go back to business school instead of “just getting the BA and figuring things out later”. I’m starting to realize that one of the major contributors to my everyday anxiety is the fact that if I do pursue Sociology, I’m highly uncertain it won’t set me up for a career or at least a job that will enable me to live a financially independent and comfortable life. 

I’ve said this in the replies below but my passion in content creating on Youtube and having worked with brands have sparked interest in business and marketing that I never had when I went to business school straight out of high school. Through this, I am starting to find my intended career path and I’m willing to take small steps to get a clearer sense of it. The fact that whenever I look at possible jobs/careers/college programs I always lean towards business is telling. 

Trivial, but I’ll be more confident at least to tell people I’m in school for a BBA to become xyz compared to trying to explain why I’m in school for a BA in Sociology."
How valuable is PTO to you?,"I know this is ultimately a personal decision but would love some opinions. 

I have a job offer with 21 days PTO (including holidays but not sick time) and my current job has 47 days (also including holidays but not sick time).

The new job is in a better city - warmer, more things to do, etc. It definitely seems like a great fit for me lifestyle wise, but my current job is close to family whereas the new one is a 5 hour connecting flight away.

My husband and I want to start a family soon so it seems crazy to give up all that PTO ...26 days difference - over a month more time to live life instead of be in a 9-5 office. 

I think I know the answer already.... I just feel so trapped by this awesome benefit! No companies I look at are even close. Oh also salary is only marginally more, not enough to make a difference."
How to find a job that you really enjoy without focusing on money?,"So, every job I look at I’m focused on how much money I’ll be making rather than if I can do that job or if I’ll like it. While I would love to make a lot of money, I believe my true focus right now should be figuring out what I even like. How were you guys able to find something you like and enjoyed regardless of money?"
How did this guy get hired? Should i escalate him?,"New guy from other department got hired into my department.

Hes only 1 year but is getting paid handsomely compared to the rest of us because of his qualification.

He earns 80k total compensation a year but no knowledge of tools and workflow, makes mistakes and probably going to miss the quarterly goals i set for him.

How did he get hired? I am his colleague whos had 7 years industrial experience but his paycheck almost similar to mine because i didnt have a masters degree. i did all the work and have to pass down everything he needs to do his work. Its so tiring, but have to do it because boss asks me to."
Should I quit my Walmart job to move back in with my mom and go back to school?,"I have a bachelors degree in Art History. Since I graduated five years ago my life has been very rocky and my work history is a mess, with several extended gaps. After moving to California I ended up getting a clerical job related to my degree. I worked there a year and a half but then had a mental breakdown. I moved across the country (to Texas) and spent a year unemployed. I met someone and signed a lease with them. That lease ends in three weeks and my life has fallen apart. Since leaving California I spent a year unemployed and was then forced to take a crappy job at Walmart after failing to find work in my field. I’ve been there two months, busting my ass for peanuts. 

I will no longer be living with the person who I signed the lease with and if I decide to keep the Walmart job I will have to live with a stranger on Craigslist. I feel like I have no reason to stay in Texas (no friends or family here) but if I move back home to Iowa I am worried I won’t find a job at all. I have an utterly terrible work history with tons of job hopping and one two year gap and another year long gap. I will also be leaving this Walmart job after two months, further tarnishing my work history. Walmart was my employer of last resort and now I am quitting them too.

The town I will be moving to is significantly smaller than the big city in Texas I live in now and the employment options aren’t great. But I really feel like I need to retrain and get a practical degree rather than waste my life working  in minimum wage retail hell. I won’t be able to do that if I am struggling to survive in a city where I have no contacts. I would be able to live rent free in Iowa and could focus primarily on my education though I will obviously need to work part time.

I am almost 28 and time seems to be running out. I have been agonizing over this decision for months. Please help.

Thank you"
"Leaving my job sector to pursue career as a Dermatologist. 25, anxious about making transition. Has anyone gone back to school after many years to find another skill they were passionate in studying?","Currently employed by the postal service and have been emotionally/physically drained by seeing a positive long term career working in a company that's being plagued with political and financial pressure on top of covid19 demand. I worked with the company right before transferring to college due to me needing medical insurance and a livable salary in the city. I been thinking a lot about my passions in life, living with lupas has brought so much knowledge on my condition. Skincare is the biggest part of my routine over the years that I have been seen as the ""go-to"" opinion within my social circle over skincare suggestions, bad scalps, STI scares, etc. I've always had an odd fascination with illnesses despite me having one and thought about working in the medical field before I became a mail lady. Don't want to sound naive, but if there was any branch of medicine to study I would say dermatologist because of my medical condition and how I can help others. I don't want to pursue my original major under accounting anymore but rather as a dermatologist (with a focus on cosmetic surgery), I was on the verge on transferring to uni from a community college. After poor attempts of balancing school and work, I picked work. Now I want to go back for school on something I care about. I would be responsible for all my tuition expenses. Every decision I make now is a long term investment. Living now I am aware of my values and what I admire in a work environment. There are moments where I get anxious if I am making the right choice right now during the pandemic. Any advice, tips or feedback would be appreciated. thank you."
Does anyone have any recommendation when a coworker you trained becomes your manager?,"I have been working at my current company for almost two years. 8 months ago we hired a new person in my position who i trained on the nature of the job, and also on some of the law. This person has become my manager now even though she struggles with some of the cases, in the sense that she cant' play the devil's advocate or fully understand some of our policies. Regardless of this, she is a yes-man person so she become my manager. 

I am upset and sad about this and while i would quit in a heartbeat, i want to spend one more year in this job for my retirement to vest, and develop professionally. I think the quality of work has also slipped a bit since then, but i will own it. 

Have you been in a situation like this before? what advice to you have?"
Just don't understand how to get INTO a career?,"Please don't get me wrong - I have an excellent work ethic. I have two university degrees, but I haven't been able to use them. Ever. I just can't really understand or comprehend how to get into a career. I understand needing to start at the bottom and I'm happy to do so. It just seems almost impossible to get noticed. Specifically I have degrees in design and film and television. But this industry is almost like a locked vault, and I just can't break in. 

But it seems the same with a lot of industries. I'm currently thinking of retraining to be something in the arts - perhaps a museum curator or archaeologist or an art historian or something. I also have a passion for fashion and costume design. And writing... But it seems like it would be the same issue. 

How do people actually get into their chosen career paths in this day and age? It seems so difficult to get your foot in the door. I'm really sorry if this comes off as whinging - I'm not. I'm just genuinely at a loss and confused about how to START, and how to do it successfully."
"Recruiters, what does it mean when you ask - ""Are you currently pursuing any other jobs/opportunities?""","Recruiters, HR and hiring managers, I've started getting a lot of phone screens and interviews and have been asked if ive been applying to other roles. 

What do they mean by this? 
Is there an ulterior motive? 
Do some recruiters exclude candidates who are applying elsewhere?
How should I respond?"
Can you ask for a raise if your rent is going up?,Can you ask for a raise due to rent increasing? It seems weird.. I have seen it happen on a couple tv shows and someone told me they asked for a pay increase when their rent went up. Do people do this?
"The career that I've studied, worked, loved and committed myself to has changed so much over the last ten years that I don't like it anymore. What do I do now?","There's a lot to say but I'll try to abridge. I went and talked to a career counselor at my wife's suggestion, but I feel like he wasn't super helpful.

I like movies. I like film. I like everything about it (editing, acting, cinematography, model making, physical effects, marketing and advertising of movies, even film accounting).

I got a job doing VFX 9 years ago. I enjoyed it. I was good at it. I had free time and projects of my own to work on. Life was good.

Fast forward 9 years and things are very different; the industry has changed a lot. The companies I used to work for have done massive rounds of layoffs and closed offices. I've had to move outs of the US to find a job. I am very near the top of my career path (I'm currently supervising about 30 artists and may be supervising as many as 100 before the end of the year) but I feel like I don't want to be doing this anymore.

1. I have basically no free time (this is especially bothering because I have a very young child who essentially never get to see). I've worked every single weekend for the last three months (I don't get paid OT either) and its going get a lot worse before it gets better. This seems to be a general trend for the industry as well. It's probably worse in the company I'm at, but its not great a lot of places.
2. I have no time to work on my own projects/art and even if I did, the company I work for doesn't allow people to work on their own projects on the side.
3. I'm not taking home a lot of money. I'm making an ok salary, but taxes here are almost 50%, the place I'm living is kind of expensive (by necessity) and after living expense I'm pretty close to breaking even. We're able to set aside maybe $100-$200 a month but we're essentially one car problem away from having a negative income. My wife can't work in this country for language reasons.
4. It's not creatively fulfilling.

So I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've invested so much of myself into this career, but now I've reached a place where it seems like there is nowhere else to go, and I don't like where I am. 

I don't want to move up in my career path because those guys have even less free time than I do. I just don't understand having a job where you never do anything but work. What's the point? Why am I earning money if I never leave the office to spend it? What's the point of having a family if you never get to see them?

I don't want to stay where I am because it's kind of a miserable existence. If I move back to the US I don't think I could find another job. Despite having skills and experience, it's a very competitive market and hard to find a job. I applied for a full year in the US (I made myself apply for a minimum of three jobs a week) and I didn't get so much as a interview.

So now what? I have these skills I developed for the last 16 years but I'm just going to move back to the US and...flip burgers or something.

I've toyed with the idea of trying to freelance, but I wouldn't know the first thing about how to find customers for this kind of work. It's usually the kind of thing people go to big companies to have done.

I don't even know what I'm asking. I feel completely lost and unhappy and trapped.
Guess I just needed to vent.

Thanks"
Could I reasonably learn enough Excel to pass a skills assessment over one weekend?,"Had an interview for a great position but I definitely oversold my Excel skills and now they want me back for a skills test. I used to be okay, but I'm really really rusty. How realistic would it be to cram over the weekend?

Also, I would welcome any online resources anyone has!

Update: I did the test and it went okay! I actually think I kind of overthought things a bit too much and tried to do formulas where they just wanted manual entry. Thank you all for your helpful advice! Even if I don't get the job, I am much better versed in excel because you, which is always good!"
Just landed a job earning $140k/year. I don't have a college degree. Should I go back to school and finish?,"I have been working in the tech industry for about 10 years and have worked my way up through a few different software engineer positions. I originally attended 2 years at a university studying computer science, but had to stop going to school and start working due to health issues my mother was having at the time. I had no choice but to live independently, and I couldn't afford to take on more student loan debt to keep going to school so the only option was to work.

10 years later, I still haven't finished a degree because I haven't had much incentive to do so. I kept getting raises, was able to buy a home, pay off all my debt, invest in my retirement, and generally live a pretty good financially secure life. However, it still bothers me that I don't have that piece of paper. No one has ever asked if I actually hold a degree, and I have worked alongside people with master's degrees who were far less capable than me. For some reason, however, it still makes me very insecure.

Going back and finishing a CS degree certainly wouldn't be so that I could increase my earning potential (or will it?). Also, no companies have ever denied me a job citing lack of a 4 year degree.

If I do go back to school, I'd probably have a solid 2 years (60 credit hours) to finish. Not all of my credits transferred to a local university, and I didn't take all of the undergrad general studies years ago because I was more interested in CS at the time.

Financially speaking, it will probably cost between $15-20K to finish. It would also take me for freaking ever because I am working full time and would only be able to take a couple night/online courses (6 credit hours max) per semester.

So, what are your thoughts? Should I go back and finish this degree? What will it really provide besides being an expensive way to curtail my own insecurities?"
What in the world can I do with two LibArts degrees besides burn them for warmth?,"tl;dr version: I was the first person in my family to go to college, so I was unprepared and I panicked. I majored in English and History (yeah, I know). I graduated in 2008 right as the economy tanked, panicked again, and entered grad school...as a history major. Yeah, I KNOW. I wanted to remain in academia and go into teaching at the university level, but full-time tenure-track jobs in the humanities are so hard to come by that unless you go to a top tier school, you're pretty much SOL. So now I'm in my early 30s and sitting on two utterly useless degrees, and besides stepping out into oncoming traffic, I have no idea what to do with my life and all this wasted time and money.   


I live in the economic wasteland that is West Virginia. I've applied for what feels like every job in every surrounding state that would be a relatively ""easy"" move, but on the rare occasion I ever get an interview, I never get the job. I can't afford to just pack up and move without having a job in the place first; no one's going to let me sign a lease just on the promise that \*maybe\* I can find a job once I get there.   


If I apply for jobs I know I'm overqualified for, I never hear back. No surprise there. But I also very rarely hear back from jobs I'm actually qualified for. I don't even get excited when I get an interview request anymore because I know what's going to happen. And it's not like I go into them like Eeyore or anything; I'm actually a very bubbly, friendly person in real life and I carry myself well in interviews. I'm just never good enough.   


So what do I do when I've already so thoroughly hosed myself here? Going back to school isn't an option. I'm already up to my eyeballs in debt because I took out loans in grad school to help take care of my parents. First gen college student, remember? Easy money when your family's never been above the poverty line. So what can I possibly do to make this situation better? I've been writing and editing online for almost 10 years now, but I have nothing to show for it; it's all been in content mill hell sites and ghostwritten, so I don't even have a byline anywhere. I've worked off and on as a legal assistant in a law firm this past year (yay for layoffs) and my sometimes-boss has told me I need to consider law school because apparently I have a natural knack for it, but again: I am NOT adding another $100k+ to my student loan tab. I can't pay the ones I've already got. I've thought of making a niche in legal writing and turning that into a freelance business, but I don't think I'm cut out to be my own boss.   


How do I try to salvage whatever's left of my life without going back to school and taking on even more debt? I want to help people. I know that. I really think grant writing would be right up my alley. I've volunteered as a grant writer before and really enjoyed it, but getting a job in the field without the marketing/communications/statistics background most commonly wanted seems impossible.   


I'm just feeling really down and desperate and could use a gentle nudge (or a shove, whatever) in the right direction."
How the hell am I meant to get a job after graduation if employers all want 3+ years of experience and tonnes of certificates??,"Just graduated last month with an MA in linguistics and I've been job hunting on indeed, jobsite, totaljobs as well as making a linkedin. Been applying for months for jobs, however, even entry level banking jobs want experience and certificates. It makes no sense to me, how are you meant to get experience if no one wants to hire you? Even internships these days want certificates or experience. My situation is even more strenuous as I'm in the U.S and looking at getting a Tier 2 visa to work in the UK, which is where my degree is from. Specifically Glasgow uni. Everyone talks about going to uni and getting a degree opening doors for you, but I do not see any semblance of a door opening and at 20 years old, it's got me questioning if it was even worth it. Wanted to go back and get my PhD/do another degree in physics, but that's no guarantee that either of those would help me. My career guidance team basically did nothing to point me in a direction. I've resorted to adding old teachers and profs on LinkedIn and trying to network with them. What are you lot's thoughts?

Edit: I have been applying despite experience requirements but haven’t heard anything back. "
I'm 22 and I'm stuck. What can I do?,"Currently working at a grocery store

I've thought of becoming a nurse, HVAC tech, audio engineer, aircraft mechanic, forester, industrial engineer, accountant, chef, the list goes on and on.

I've not completed schooling, I've just worked dead end jobs for the past 3 years. I was in special education in highschool for ADHD and I've tried a stimulant when I was 19 and it didn't work out. Things happened, then I'm basically back to square one living with my parents.

I've completed my remedials, and then English 101 and a couple of electives (one elective earned in highschool). I have a gpa of 3.8.

I have no idea what I want to do. I'm thinking of moving out of my parents and move in with my brother who will charge me $550 in rent along with about a $160 car bill a month. Up there I can go to school and study business. 

Down here it's cheaper because I'm living with my parents, but I just hate it down here. I'm thinking of going to college here because it's just cheaper, but what's the point if I'm going to be here for like another 4 years? I'd like to move out and back home.

I may sound selfish with this post and I apologise for that. I guess you could say I'm just looking for general support, not just career guidance. I am lost at the moment and maybe I just want to be happy and content. But my mind just races and I'm worried I'll make the wrong choice.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Is it worth going back to school for a completely different career path?,"Hi all, I'm a 25 female who currently has a bachelors in marketing. I've been working this career path for about three years now in traditional and digital marketing - I hate it. I want to do something more full-filling but I can't figure out what that is yet.

Part of my REALLY wants to do nursing but I struggle with emetophobia. Part of me also wants to go for psychology but I would have to get a graduate/doctorate to do most things (I think). 

So, is it really worth it to go back to school and accrue more debt to completely change your career path? And if it is, how do you pick the right choice this time?"

Feeling overwhelmed at work and actually broke down in public today - What should I do?,"Hi everyone,

Posting here because I don't know where else to go, and I'm too embarrassed to tell the full story to my family and friends.

I recently started a new job after graduation, and it's been about 3 months. Yet things don't seem to be getting better.... I'm just getting so tired. I bring my work home almost every day, and even then, it seems like I'm still not finishing fast enough.

They say the team you work with makes a hell of a difference - thats definitely true. I have an amazing team, but a manager who's a lot more particular and brutally straightforward about it..... it's been a bit harder in that aspect. I feel like I've fucked up, almost every single day. Every day there's a new crisis, even over the weekends because everyone still actively emails over the weekend.... I couldn't take it. Broke down at the dinner table today in front of my boyfriend's family after half a day of replying nasty emails and I'm utterly mortified.

Has anyone else here faced a similar situation? Did you stick it out, or find someplace better? Today was the first time in this three months that I've genuinely considered applying somewhere else.... I don't know anymore."
Well paying jobs with less human interaction ?,"Hi guys. 

I'm pretty bad at human interaction. I'm an introvert, awkward and distant, and I always have trouble putting on the professional client-facing face that my coworkers do. I ended up in digital marketing and 2 years in, there's not much people interaction but as my career progresses I know there will be (i.e. company expands or if I join another company). I'm also losing interest in my current digital marketing role. So I'm not really looking forward to how my career progresses. 

I'm rethinking the path I'm on. I'm 27 (med school drop out, got lost a bit) which I feel is already too old to rethink things(I guess I'm comparing to my peers) but I really want to enjoy what I do. **Money** is a huge factor and I would like to reach a good salary fast.

A part from just going with it and getting used to people, is there a route I can take to a well paying marketing job with less interactions, or does it get worse from here? :/

If there's any other less/no people, well paying career paths, please do share. I am truly lost because the people thing is an issue for me :( and I'm bad at it no matter how much I try. I am willing to study subjects on the side if it means I can find something I enjoy. 

About me: 27f, I like research, being pedantic about little things (lol), environmental conservation, science, art, how the universe works, and the theoretical side of marketing. School subject faves were biology and physics, but I never dabbled in commerce so I don't know if I would have liked it. Since leaving my bad experience in med school, I've stayed away from science.

Please help! Questions , advice, tips, anything is appreciated.

Thank you !!

Edit: Thank you everyone for your responses, encouragement and guidance! I'm looking into a few things now. Hope everyone in a similar positions as myself finds their way too<3"
Boss asked me pour/serve him water - is this appropriate in a professional workplace?,"So I'm kind of at a loss for words. I serve as a Chief of Staff for my boss, but at times he treats me like an entry level assistant \(or even intern\). I've been asked to get coffee, which I feel a bit overqualified for but have learned to bite my tongue, but I've also been asked to do more and more waitressing type duties like clean up his office once he leaves \(he leaves his trash/old cups of coffee etc and I've been told that I'm supposed to wash them.\) One time, he left his old coffee cup in the conference room and a senior associate took the dirty cup and left it on my desk \- with the assumption that it was my duty to go clean it. I have over 10 years of experience and my job is far from entry level. I have really downplayed how much this has bothered me but this past week I was called into his office and he asked me to pour him water and bring it over to him. He was only a few feet away.  I felt that it was very demeaning. I mean, we are in 2018 \- I'm not a secretary from the 60's. Am I wrong thinking this is inappropriate? If so, how should I handle all of the above?"
How can I stop worrying over future workplaces and mean colleagues?,"I've always dealt with insanely rude, downright batsh!t crazy colleagues and bosses in my young career (I'm 26). I realize there is always someone like this either at school and work, but how do I ""get used to it""? 

One job I had, the manager screamed at everyone daily, including me, for no reason other than that was just the way he was. No one was doing anything wrong or not doing their job, but he was a seriously angry person who screamed if you didn't ""look busy"" enough. There was work to do and we were all doing it, but he was never satisfied. They were good colleagues actually, but this manager was the antichrist. 

My last job had a colleague who also threw insane temper tantrums just because she hated almost everyone on earth. She hated young people (we all have ""no work ethic"" according to her 60-something year old mind), people of any color except white, and anyone not American. She would throw things around the office and bully me verbally. I went to the boss a few times because she never did anything to fix this problem, and the boss actually snapped at me for complaining over it too much. Basically I was forced to enable the colleague's behavior like everyone else, so I quit. I cannot just ""get along"" with someone to make them happy, but I also will not argue with someone and act unprofessional like them. 

I'm scared to work now lol to put it bluntly. I'm actually scared of these people because I do struggle with anxiety and having to be around people who are always angry and screaming is a living nightmare for me. I do not like confrontation yet I'm always forced to interact with people who love to fight the entire 8 hour work day.

Is this how my working life is going to be? How do I actually deal with this? Or should I just try to find work at home jobs and/or start my own thing? Offices are horrible places, and I'm not willing to deal with irate colleagues the rest of my life. Being around people like this gets my heart racing and I shake from the anxiety it causes me. I've developed horrible IBS from it all. It's obviously been very bad on my health. At my last job I would have to leave the office because I would cry and almost throw up from the acid in my stomach that would get out of control due to the anxiety of the colleague bullying me and a boss who didn't care about it. 

I don't know what to do. How do you all deal with situations like this? It seems like there's no light in sight unless I can figure out a way to make a living on my own."
Should I let go of work ethics ?,"Hello all,

I have a bit of an awkward question. I have been working in software industry for the past 2 years.

I personally love being an engineer since it is a knowledge based profession. You work hard, you study, you get results. You either know the stuff, or you don't. Very simple and clean dynamics.

However I have always had these teammates who were more focused on marketing themselves and polishing their CV rather than actually learning a thing or two, and doing the job. They usually are very dominant and dramatic people as well, often not afraid to pick up a fight or lie.

Now at my current job, except me and another coworker, rest of the team is focused on exploiting company resources to interview with other companies. I mean I can handle one rotten apple every now and then, but having an entire team that is lying to manager (they make up a story together) and manipulating him in order to get those resources so they can interview with FAANG or some start up is just insane.

I mean yesterday I was ill, took a sick leave, and I asked my team if someone can switch with me regarding a task at 9 am. Only that colleague helped me and he only did that afternoon. They practically didn't even responded me for half a day. How on earth I am supposed to work like this ? This is not even limited to times I am on leave and need help. It is just everyday behavior.

These people are like a cult. They have no shame, no ethics, nothing. Most of them are not doing anything for months but claiming they are just busy and get aggressive if you ask more about their work. When given a task they are doing extremely poorly yet still blame the client for being unhappy.

It looks like this is what the market is all about. Anyone who can talk about some generic concepts or simple architecture and a BFS algorithm seems to get the job but cannot do the job itself, rinse and repeat.

Am I being naive continuing to work hard to learn things ? Should I let go of work ethics ?"
Should I Accept Job Offer Even Though it is VERY Bad Timing?,"TL;DR - Mixed feelings about accepting likely job offer since it is very bad timing for my current company. 

I have been at a large F100 company for about four years and I am hoping I will receive an external offer tomorrow for my dream job at a fast growing start up (different industry). I had a great round of interviews yesterday and the recruiter told me I was the only candidate who made it to this stage. 

I am worried I am going to burn bridges at my old company, even with a two week’s notice, since my last day would be the same as our top contributing team member, who is going on maternity leave.

I have been training with my pregnant team member to take over a portion of her role while she is on leave. This is going to be very difficult for them, but I am so excited about this potential position, I don’t think I can turn it down without major regrets.

To make things more interesting, I also just received a promotion and a 10% raise one month ago.  And they paid for my MBA (clawback expired earlier this year). 

Is there any way I can avoid burning bridges with my current team?  I feel like I am being incredibly selfish and experiencing major guilt.  Any advice on how to handle this sticky situation would be greatly appreciated."
How do you find a job when you have no job?,"A lot of employees say it is easier to find a job when you are still currently employed. But I just lost my job. Now I have all the time in the world. And I'm scared.  I don't have the time to be waiting around for interviews to be handed to me. I'm not sure what to do in the meantime. Money is not a factor, but just waiting around, gets me anxious. And I don't even know if I have the experience. This is all so scary."

How common is it back out of accepting a job offer?,"I am having a lot of second thoughts about taking a job with a start up. I had some red flags about their hiring process and realized that it may not actually be in line with my career goals in the way that I thought.

How common is it for people to back out of accepting an offer or even working the position for a month before leaving?"
"Girls, what would you do if you noticed that your boyfriend (and colleague) is treated better than you in your same workplace, with same duties?","I [21F] feel like I'm being treated differently in my new workplace. I know I should probably be quiet because I receive my salary, and this is what job is supposed to give you. However, I'm really hurt. I feel bad, with no gratification. The fact that I'm always treated differently makes me feel like I'm a bad person and I don't know what to do.

Let me first tell you that the job consists in taking care of animals for a company. We DO NOT have personal relationships with our superiors because we don't work together. Our job is really lonely and nobody sees us when we work. The only way our superiors know we have done the job is because we sign a paper when we start and finish the job: nothing more. No personal relationship to justify such behaviours.

I, biology student, got hired after a regular job interview. It went amazingly: they seemed to be really happy about what I did and how I think. I felt like I had found the right place for me.
After the interview I was asked to work 6 hours every day for my first month in order to do some practice, even though I got hired to work during the weekend. After that, I just did my weekend job.

On the other hand things have been a bit different for my boyfriend [26M], psychology student, when was hired. He got the job because he was unemployed and after a few months working there I suggested him to try the interview as well even if the job isn't consistent with his studies.

The interviewers knew he was my boyfriend and I think this helped him being hired: he told me that when they found that out they said nice words about me and their attitude changed instantly towards him too. He was also prepared because since I did the interview before him I knew exactly what they were looking for and I gave him some advice too.

However, the differences in the treatment between us were clear from the beginning.

In chronological order:

First of all, during the interview they gave my boyfriend free gadgets and a book. I have never received anything from them and I'm sure it's not because I'm a bad employee or something.

In addition, nobody asked him to work 6 hours everyday for the first month to do some practice like I did, even if he needed it more than me (at least I'm a biology student and I studied zoology, he is a psychology student and knows NOTHING about animals). He started immediately with the weekend job and at the moment we have the same duties.

Furthermore, at Christmas he received a present from the company (nothing personal: if that was from a friend, I wouldn't be bothered) and I didn't. I honestly don't care about the present: it was nothing I wanted or needed, but I was hurt by the fact that I wasn't (again) treated equally.

Moreover, he got his contract renewed only after 3 months he got hired. They told me I was going to be having it renewed too as well, but besides words, no facts. I had to ask THE DAY BEFORE its validity passed and only then they renewed my contract. And also, I noticed that my contract is shorter than my boyfriend's one, for no reason. Same job. Same duties. Mine will last until 11/2020; his will last until 12/2020. I've worked there for a longer time, plus I did a month full time too and I don't know how to justificate this difference between us: I worked more and I'm more prepared. Never caused troubles, always had a positive attitude and I'm friend with every colleague now.

Finally, yesterday we received our salary and he got 1/3 MORE than he was expecting (we are paid for the amount of hours done), while nobody ever gave me an Euro more.

What do you think of this situation? What do you recommend me to do?


TLDR: same workplace and job, but even if my bf got hired after me and the job isn't consistent with his studies, he was given presents and my same duties without the daily 6-hours month of practice I was supposed to do and receives a higher salary and better contract renewal. Am I overreacting? What should I do?"
Should I leave a toxic work environment after only 3 months of working there? I was previously unemployed for 8 months prior to taking this job.,"About a year ago, I left a terrible job. I had stayed for a year and it was the longest year of my life. The job was 100% travel, I was frequently required to work 60+ hour weeks, management was unsupportive, and there was a severe lack of training, resources, and staff. I took 4 months off to recover from health issues related to my job, then 4 months later I landed another position.

I have been with my new company for about 3 months now, and unfortunately, it shares many of the same problems as my old company. Though the work itself is ideal for this stage in my career, the company culture is extemely toxic, and I am miserable. Here are some things other people have said about my new company (which I can agree with, from my short time there):

* ""HIGH turnover.""
* ""Terrible work culture.""
* ""Unrealistic expectations.""
* ""Stifling company culture adds to low morale."" 
* ""Lack of resources from excessive penny pinching - both manpower and equipment - to do efficient work.""
* ""Severe lack in manpower due to high turnover, which results in other employees being overloaded.""
*  ""You will not be treated like you are human, they do not value or respect their employees.""

Shortly before I accepted this position, 4 out of 5 team members all left within the same month. Then I was hired, and now the 5th team member is leaving, meaning I will be the only person left working under my manager (who is the cause of the mass exdous). Things are unlikely to change and I have to go. 

At this point I have 3 options:

1. Submit my 2 weeks notice immediately. If I do this I will have 5 months of experience on my resume (May-Sept).
2. Submit my 2 weeks notice in a month. If I do this I will have 6 months of experience on my resume (May-Oct).
3. Wait until I have something else lined up.

I understand that it is always ideal to have another job lined up before quitting, but I really want to leave ASAP. Every day at this place feels like a week, and I have constant anxiety. I don't sleep well, and a lot of my time outside of work is consumed by thinking about work, and trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. I also want to add that I have money saved up for maybe about 6 months of unemployment.

My biggest concern is how this will look on a resume. Is 5 months enough time to leverage my experience to help me land a similar position with a different company? Is there any difference between staying 5 months versus staying 6 months? If I have 8 months of unemployment followed by 5 months at a job and another period of unemployment, will that make me look ""unhireable""? What is everyone's thoughts on my best option?"
"My degree is useless, I can't get far in my job and I'm scared to pursue my passions. What do I do next?","Tldr at bottom

I like biology and heathcare but am very shy and introverted. Wanted to work in a lab but only really determined this after graduating. My 2.2 in Human Bioscience won't really get me anywhere.

Now I work in a NHS lab as an assistant but can't go beyond band 4 (caps at about £24k/yr) without another degree. Hated my time at uni which is putting me off going back. Job is okay but even in this small group I get a lot of bad anxiety (I worked in retail before). 

I'd like a career where I

 • Don't have to do night shifts. I like to be fairly consistent

 • Avoid working in huge groups or with the general public

 • Work from home or work a 4/3 week. I'd like to have children in the future

I don't mind earning less for a job that's near perfect but I'd like to earn enough for my partner (still a student) and I to live comfortably in the south of England.

Things I'm considering

 • Cake baker/decorator. I love making and decorating cakes. I make a good sponge but my decorating still needs work. It's fun but I'm scared of messing up especially when someone paid for my services. On a related note opening a cafe has been considered too.

 • Indie game development. I started a Unity/C# course on Udemy and I really enjoy doing pixel art. I've made games with my partner before and it's fun but I know it's not very reliable

 • Something programming related. I did computing for a short while during my a levels and loved programming but didn't enjoy the theory. Don't know much about software development as a career

Tldr 20-something graduate who loves baking and pixel art wants career that doesn't increase social anxiety but pays okay. 

Sorry for so much information but I really need help!

Edit: wow I wasn't expecting so many responses. Thank you very much everyone. I guess things aren't at a  dead end just yet

Today they fired my 83yr old Grandma from work what can she do?,"So would hopefully come across some legal or insightful advice on what a sad situation of 37 loyal years to a company only to get booted. (Illinois)

She worked for this company 37 yrs, never called off unless it was an emergency rare, always on time unless there was a valid problem which was less than 10, and today they gave her the boot.

The company claimed she fell asleep a month ago wrote her up but she did not sign it because she did not agree with it, and she supposedly fell asleep again on Friday, however no video/image/witness proof exists, **having this job provided the insurance she needs (blue cross bs and Medicare part a part b) , she enjoyed feeling needed, she enjoyed her coworkers,** brightened her sprits and for them to just boot her was malicious.

Apparently their insurance went up because of her age is what an insider mentioned to me, which if true seems to be a plan of action to get rid of her.

**The saddest part that broke my heart was, as she was let go they told her to leave and do not say goodbye to anyone as she left, treating her like she was a criminal of some sort, who does that!!!! If they did nothing wrong, I would at least after 37 yrs of loyalty let her say her goodbyes, how rude.**

Is there any possibility of something to do? The insider mentioned to go to the company for her and ask for the visual proof of what they claim happened, anything other, my mind is so wrapped up in comforting her I can't think.

Thank you in advance to those who can provide some help, if you can't please vote this up so it can get to the eyeballs of someone that can maybe."
Salary raise for an internal promotion?,"I’ve been offered an internal promotion with quite significant increase in responsibility, mainly line management responsibilities of four of my colleagues who I’m currently the same level as. I’ve been told to expect only a modest increase in pay due to getting quite a good bump in salary in the middle of last year. Is there an average increase people look for with these types of things?"
What do I do if I'm starting over at 35?,"Well, here I am. I’m 35 and without a job and I have no idea what I’m doing. I left my last job due to management issues. I’m trying to decide what to do next. I’ve debated going back to school but I’m worried that after the time and financial commitment I’ll end up hating it and be right back in the same boat only then I’ll be closer to 40.

Any advice on how to find the right fit for me? How can I assess my skills and education to find what jobs I would be qualified for? Should I eat the expense and hire a career counselor? I’m incredibly lost right now and any advice anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated."

Current Employer was contacted by a possible employer. How to proceed?,"So I cam currently in the job market and have applied and interviewed for a position. On their application it asks for employment history and if they may contact that employer. So I filled out the application and said no they can not contact my current employer but they may contact my previous employer. Well they contacted my current employer to my surprise. I had a meeting with my manger, HR and the president of the company discussing why I was looking to leave and stuff like that. I had thought that this was very unprofessional as it felt confrontational in the meeting, but now the reason I am writing this is now I am in a strange position at work. I have not received an offer letter from that company yet so that has me a bit unease at work. But my question is what do you think I should do? Is there anything i could do if they fire me? I don't think they will fire me as that would just open them up to a lawsuit.. I think. But is there anything I could do in regards to the possible employer if I do not get the position?

"Unpaid interships after graduating college and having done previous internships.., Are you Fucking kidding me?","I've been suggested by people to look into unpaid interships to get my foot in the door. Additionally, google seems to affirm this as a possible route, especially for jobs in communications which have lower salaries then most career paths anyways. 

So, are people really paying to live in expensive cities to work for free for a company that may or may not be exploiting their labor and never hire them? And do companies offering full time positions expect you to have 4 internships by the time you have graduated from top companies in order to get an entry level position?

"Graduated, Unemployed, and Attending a Conference. How do I explain that Sciatica has held me back and slowly taken over my life? I'd rather not mention it when networking but how else do I explain what I'm doing in my life?","Hi there! 

I'm attending my first APA conference soon and I'm not sure how to present myself. 

Here's a backstory: I graduated (undergrad) in May 2019, with a BA in psychology and a minor in business administration. While most people get a job related to their field after they graduate, I had the opposite experience. A few months after graduating, I had to quit the job I had during my time in college to go through 3 hip procedures, a few steroid injections, the list is nauseating. Anyways, I've experienced progressive pain for the last 2 years, and have been diagnosed with Piriformis Syndrome and Sciatica. After graduating, it seems like my body decided to just freak out and forget how to function.

In a perfect world, I would go to a doctoral program for clinical neuropsychology or have a position at a facility for clinical research. But as things currently stand, I have a degree that I'm sitting on, no school affiliation, no past internship, little to no experience in my field, no job, and possible limitations on my future due to my pain. 

This conference will be full of accomplished doctors, with years of experience, achievements, publications, all the works. During any networking, getting to know people includes asking about what they do or what they're working on. What exactly am I supposed to say about myself? *""Yeah hi, I'm an insomniatic blob of pain and don't really know if I can function well enough to complete grad school but I love research so do you have any job openings?""*

Any advice would be great, as it's quite intimidating and I'm very nervous about self-presentation when there isn't anything to present.  *Thank you in advance!*"
How much notice do I need to give my current employer if I've been here for 6 years and my work is is very specialized?,"Hi!

Basically, I've been working for my current company for about 6 years now. It's the only professional job I've ever had and I've steadily moved up from financial analyst to VP. My boss is the CFO and he's very absent. I probably have talked to him four times this year. I heard that my company was closing it's doors through the grapevine, and I confronted my boss about it and he confirmed it was true. He told me I had 6-18 months (\*scratches head\*). He told me that he supports me wanting to leave but needed appropriate notice. He didn't specify what this was. My workload is either crazy stressful or non-existent. Has mostly been non-existent for the past couple year. To keep me around, I have a high salary and position title because they need me for this model I built that nobody else knows how to operate, but that's about it.

Anyways, I've been following this new company for 6 months and a job opened up that I thought I'd be a good fit for. Same pay, better benefits, same location...new coworkers lol. Nervous about it but I think that I'm finally ready to leave and start learning again. I passed the first interview and the excel test and have the final interview this Thursday. So my question is this: how much notice do I need to give my boss? My only motivation for this is that I want my annual bonus which I would receive in February. I think it's plausible I would receive this because my company laid off a bunch of people in August and gave them three months notice and also the bonus they would have received in 2020. I think that is generous of them. I know that I'll have to train somebody on how to use my model, though it also occurred to me that they might keep me on as a contractor? Has anybody ever seen this before? Also for this new job, do you think I need to be completely transparent that I haven't spoken to my current employer about leaving? I am worried my current position will need me to stay a month and that will be too long for the new job. Am I just being too anxious about this switch?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thanks so much in advance for all your input! Happy Holidays!

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I am in the US, and I have a final final interview this Friday with the new company. I appreciate all the feedback - you guys are so helpful! If I get the job, I am going to wait until I have an offer letter, and then I am going to tell my boss that I am willing to do whatever it takes to ensure my workload is covered by an existing employee. And then ask for a severance package similar to the people they laid off. Truthfully, my boss is a really nice guy and I think he might be willing to give me my bonus in exchange for ensuring all of my reporting etc is taken care of. My fingers are crossed for this one. Your input was so helpful!"
"Almost 30, never had a ""real"" job, and feel just as lost on a career path as I did 10 years ago. Where can I go from here?","So yeah, I graduated college 5 years ago with a music degree and studied classical guitar. I'm still passionate about music and ideally I'd want to make it my career, but I've found it hard to concentrate on a particular thing ( I play guitar, I play bass, write songs) and have largely lacked the the motivation to dedicate myself to it.

Since graduating, I've been working part time as a writing and remedial math tutor between two community colleges. I also maintain a handful of guitar students to teach and gig fairly regularly. Honestly I like what I do, especially the music stuff, but I probably only clear about 20k a year and that is simply not enough, especially when I consider my age, what my peers are earning, and the lack of advancement of my part time job. 

Essentially, while I know I'm still gonna pursue music in some capacity, I want the piece of mind of pursuing something I can actually make a career out of. And maybe that is music, but I don't know how to get there. 

I do have some ideas. First, I know I've pretty much ruled out pursuing higher ed or public schools. While I enjoy teaching one on one, I don't think a classroom setting is for me and the cost of furthering my education for that hardly seems worth it. I am however very analytically minded, and feel like I'd make a good technician of some sort, whether that's in repairing guitars and other instruments, or working with audio/visual, or with electronics. 

It's also worth mentioning that I have a basic accounting certificate and could be an entry level bookkeeper, but I've done a bit of that work and don't particularly enjoy it, and the hourly pay was much lower by the hour than my tutoring job. I am very good with numbers and precise though.

I know I have a set of skills, I just don't know how to organize my thoughts and concentrate on one thing to really get a career going. Does anyone here have any thoughts?"
"I m 27 and on a career break and feeling lost already, what should I do?","I started working in IT right after my college, worked there for almost 2 years and got a better offer with a nice salary package abroad with a reputable MNC. Worked there for a few months and felt depressed and abruptly decided to leave and come back to my country. Right now I am unemployed and kind of feeling lost.

I am thinking about re-skill/ upskill or may go for masters.

Any advice on my situation?"
What are some flexible jobs with lots of time off that pay at least 40k?,"I am currently a GIS Analyst and I hate it. Its the monotony and repetition that gets me. The only time I have actually enjoyed the job is when they were basically forced to send me on a trip to Japan for 3 months because I am the only one in the company who has any cultural or language experience with the country (I taught English on the JET program for 3 years. On that trip we did 3 d scans of old warehouses for the Marine Corps. Otherwise my job is basically a digital assembly line. look at imagery mark features move to the right repeat continue for 8 hours a day 5 days a week for months at a time until you move to a new project marking different features but doing the exact same thing.   


My passion is acting (Specifically voice acting). If I could actually do that and make enough to live I would but unfortunately I dont live in an area where that is possible and at 34 I dont really feel like picking up and moving with no guarantees of begin able to make ends meet. I dont want to be a struggling actor working at a restaurant. I have TWO bachelors degrees and a Masters degree and yet somehow I make $21 an hour and hate my job. I have thought about going back to school for film making (I love movies and television), teaching (I enjoyed it somewhat when I was in Japan and I liked the time off), Counseling (I like people and talking one on one with them), getting a PhD in Anthropology, Geography (what my degrees are in) and trying to become a professor or researcher at a museum or something, trying to break into radio somehow?, and Speech pathology (I keep seeing part time jobs for SLP's that pay around 35 an hour and have benefits. Ideally I would have low hours 40 or less benefits but also flexible enough to continue pursuing my acting and voice acting aspirations. I dont need much in terms of money ( $43,680 per year is fine for me, but I hate what I do all day)  I have no debt and about 40k in savings but I dont want to just blow that on a pipe dream. Any ideas that I haven't thought about?"
Is Unlimited PTO a Scam?,"I work in IT and I am in the market for a new job. I currently work for a fortune 50 company so the benefits are more old school but the main perk for me here is PTO.

I currently get about 28 days a year of PTO. I am also underpaid by about 20-30k. I am looking to get closer to what I should be paid but also not take a big benefits hit.

This leads me to the concept of unlimited PTO. A lot of the positions I looked into offer it.  I don't trust it, I feel like it's just a way to make workers feel guilty about taking time off and making them beg for time off they aren't technically owed.

Does anyone have any experience with it? Am I just an old guy that doesn't understand how things work these days? Can you share your thoughts?"
How do I go about telling new employer that I need time every two weeks for therapy?,"So without getting into too many details, I go to therapy every other week for a variety of mental health issues. It is extremely beneficial for me and I don't think it is something I could cut out of my life/budget.

&#x200B;

I am starting a new job in two weeks. My current employer and I have a great relationship so I have been open with my boss about it and time wise it works out well because I don't go into work until 10 am (therapy at 830). This new job is 9-5 but like my current job has a lot of night time events and overtime where consistently scheduling therapy in the evening is very difficult.

&#x200B;

Would it be out of place for me to ask for the same 10-6 traditional work schedule before i even begin? 9-5 in my field is rare to begin with because of all the evening and night time events (I work in college student affairs). Most official hours are either 10-6 or 11-7.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you so much for your responses everyone! I start in two weeks I will see what happens. Based off of conversations I have had with them the hours seem to be negotiable week to week but push comes to shove this job has a lot of PTO I could just use it to come in a half hour late twice a month like someone mentioned."
What new skills should I learn to make more $? I currently have a do nothing job that pays 50K,"Title says it all, this is a throwaway. I have a do nothing job right now where I MAYBE get 5 hours of work a day doing web design, and a little coding. Mostly I make additions/edits to people’s websites who pay my company to build/host it. This pays 50K. I have so much extra time to learn a new skill or even take on part time work that I can do on the computer. If you have any advice on what I should be doing or learning that would be amazing because I really don’t know. Maybe certificates, a new program language, or even part time work that corresponds with what I do now? Btw I’m 24, but main goal here is to learn something that’ll make me more $.

How do you leave the steady career you if you don't even know what else should you be doing?,"Hi everyone, I'm a soon to be 29M and I feel stuck in my life.

I'm from a small town in Central Europe and have graduated in pretty generic majors. However, I was very active during my studies and got a great international opportunity from an IT company. I've worked in several countries and am currently living abroad, working as an IT Project Manager. 

On the outside it seems that I'm doing quite well but I don't feel that I want to spend the rest of my life working in IT. I don't know what else should I be doing though. This job allows me to live abroad and have a pretty good life but it just feels empty. I'm not enthusiastic about my job and I don't see much value in it.

What do you do when you feel stuck? How do you leave the steady career you if you don't even know what else should you be doing?

I feel like there are some other jobs I could enjoy more like a journalist or academic teacher. The problem is that in those jobs you're relying a lot on managers, public institutions and so on + only the very top ones get decent money... IT gives a lot of independence and stability but it's just hard for me to feel proud or excited about my job..."
Anyone Else With A Useless BA Try A Certification?,"I have a lib arts BA and I'd like to try a certification program of some sort before I commit to something like a masters program.

I am not looking to immediately make a lot of money. I just want an alternative to waiting tables :/

The one problem I will have is that I have an addiction past. I am not technically a convicted felon, but my background isn't squeaky clean, so I dont want to complete a program and then not be able to find work because of my past. (Much, much more on this in comments)

Just looking for some advice.

Does anybody else feel lonely in their office at work?,"I recently started a new job and this is the first time I’ve had my own office. I’ve only ever worked in open air offices where I was sitting next to someone with another group sitting across from me. This made it really easy to bond with coworkers. However, at my new job, everyone else, unless they’re high up, have a cubicle or a shared office (really don’t understand why I have my own) so I don’t get to chit chat with them. This usually means I’m sitting by myself for hours without seeing another person. It’s kind of lonely. Does anybody have any tips with how to deal with this or can share their experience?"
"A specific question: Has anyone had a failed figure skating, arts or sports career?","I wanted to be a professional figure skater when I grew up. When I was 7 my coach discovered that I was talented. I landed doubles and almost triples by the time I was 8. However, due to a combination of not understanding how life works, my parents discouraging me, and growing a backside after puberty (for lack of a better word)...I ended up not practicing enough. By the time I was 12, I wasn’t improving fast enough and quit. 

To this day I don’t love anything else as much as I love skating. I wonder what would’ve happened if I’d practiced more. If my parents hadn’t said so many discouraging words. My dad especially had a temper. He would lash out at me and make me feel worthless. My parents would tell me I’d never be anything, this was just a phase and would yell at me so much before my lessons that I’d get upset. Then when I got home they’d give me so much work to do and tell me how selfish I was. 

I remember all the other parents who would cheer their kids on at competitions. Who would encourage their kids to practice. Some parents were even willing to homeschool their kids so they could pursue their dreams. I watched kids who weren’t as talented as me surpass me because they had worked harder, largely because their parents supported them. 

Maybe if I had those parents, I would’ve made it to nationals. Maybe I would’ve ended up skating for a traveling show. Two of my coach’s students made nationals. One of them wasn’t as talented as me to begin with but had really nice parents and worked really hard. This makes me think I really did have a chance. 

I’ve tried skating for fun and thought about getting a coaching license. But I’d be bitter about my wasted potential.

I graduated college a few months ago and I am starting my first job as a mental health specialist next week. It’s an amazing opportunity I’m very thankful for. I still resent my parents for having discouraged the one thing I loved more than anything else. I still think about what could’ve been and the fact that I might not find anything I like better. I hear a song, or it’s cold out, and I want to go ice skating so badly and there’s no other way for me to let it all out but I can’t. I have this gut feeling that I won’t find anything better. And my life is just not going to be the best it could’ve been. 

This is a very specific experience, but I’m wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? If you ended up finding a way after an athletic career ended? "
"Five years since degree, two years unemployed. Any ideas for moving forward?","27 years old by now and my self confidence has never been lower.

My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end. Keeping up a facade would be impossible for me as I'm an introvert and have a hard time with a severely damaged self image.

&#x200B;

So since my degree I went back to my work full-time at a local industrial production company and worked there for 3 years. My boss would always complement me on helping out and working extra etc, whatever you could wish for as a reference to a next job in a new career. 

&#x200B;

But with time passing by and being stuck with a, to be honest, shitjob even tho I had a degree the field was ""screaming for"", my mental state straight up sank to levels I didn't know was possible. So I quit my job just to break the cycle. All it did was me ending up in a bubble and a far worse depression. 

&#x200B;

Now it's been 2 years and I don't know where to go from here. Should I forget my degree altogether or **have people come back from this at all?** The degree isn't bad, I'm the only one who couldn't get a job as far as I know, even people with worse grades etc. Study a new field? Tried that for a year, just thought it would end up as last time so I dropped the plans (plus the school was nothing like Univ.)"
How do you cope with being the only female or one of the few in the office?,I work in engineering field which I knew was very male dominated when I got into it. Recently the male dominated and boys club aspects of the job are starting to get to me. I try my best not to think that I'm being passed up on work or being treated different because of my gender but it's hard. How do you cope with this without making a big deal about it?
Intimidated by the “business world”. Any tips/advice?,"
Ive been a meat cutter for the past 4 years. Currently at whole foods and pretty good at what I do.... But im about to graduate with a degree in accounting and analytics. Going to pursue a career in data science, and I just happened to see last night that my salary will be close to 100k a year... I make $15 an hour right now. 

Im used to punching in and punching out. Taking lunch. Having things that have to be done every single time you work. Im used to coming home covered in meat/fish. 
Idk how to prepare myself for the business world. Im used to structure, and dealing with customers. Im not a huge people person honestly and id rather deal with customers than have to maintain relationships with coworkers. I love data science though. And im really good at that too. Just nervous that Im not “mature enough” or whatever to work in a professional environment like that. Im moving to another state this summer, and applying for jobs this week. 
Has anyone had an experience like this? Was it difficult to adjust?"
What the heck is a 3-hour interview for and how do I conquer it?,"Reddit Family,

I need advice on how to tackle and/or insight on 3-hour interviews? Are interviews this long normal in the workforce? My dream company is considering me for a role I’ve been wanting for quite sometime.  Any idea why they’re having me meet with 4 people, in 45-minute intervals rather than a simple panel interview? How do o keep my pre-prepared question list fresh—is it okay to ask each of them the same questions at the conclusion of each conversation? Looking forward the responses! TIA!"
Switch careers to pay off loan?,"just graduated with a degree in kinesiology and I got a 70k debt for it. I’m in a huge rut. Regardless of what mistakes I made, I need a plan to fix this. I don’t have a high enough GPA to do post grad near me and going abroad is out of the option. And the job opportunity and pay for kin is laughable. 

So I need advice on what career I should look into that I can learn relatively quickly to pay off my loan on a useless degree. I was thinking about learning code-getting into the computer field,  or go into a skilled labour trade. 

At the end of the day I love the health care field and helping people. I plan on going back to health care once I get my financial situation managed. But for now I need just money, I don’t care what type of job it is. Your advice and experience will be greatly appreciated."

Did I commit ​career suicide?,"Hi everyone,

Created a throwaway account due to sheer embarrassment. I am 26F, living in Toronto. I have 4.5 years of work experience. 4 years with a big financial services company where I was a business analyst and a project manager. I loved working there, however after 4 years I decided to move elsewhere so I could grow. Actually, I was pretty desperate to switch towards the end as my old company started going through a lot of changes. I still loved my job but wanted to move to a place with a better culture.  I got a higher paying job with a promotion with this investment management company. On paper it sounded very cool and I thought I would be doing the exact same things that I loved doing at my old job. However, once I joined, I found out it was far from truth. They had just drafted the role in such a way that I would say yes (the new company reached out to me and was very keen on me joining). I hated being there. I hated doing my job because it wasn't what I signed up for. On top of it, my manager made my life hell. She had no trust in her employees and kept a close eye on my monitor. If I stopped working for a min, she would start questioning me. This was also the time when I was going through A LOT at home. My brother who abused me during childhood moved in with me with my parents. My parents knew what he did to me but still insisted I put it behind me and become the bigger person to improve his life. With the stress from home and work, I got majorly depressed and went into a very dark place. Finally I decided to quit my job after being there for 5 months because I wanted time off for myself.

&#x200B;

It's been a month since then and I managed to kick my brother out. I have been actively applying for roles but I just dont hear back. When I was employed, I was actively applying too and I would hear back from 3/10 places I would apply to. I have a strong background and have worked for Fortune 500 companies only. But now, there are NO replies. I am still depressed and working on myself but it feels like I committed a career suicide by quitting only after 5 months. It makes me look unreliable or that I was fired only after 5 months. I know a month is a short time but 0 replies after having a strong resume is really pulling me down. The only responses I get are rejections. I am trying to look into going back to school also but everything just feels like dead end to me. I don't want to go back to that job I just quit because it was hell working there. Any advice or input would be appreciated. If anyone is willing to review my resume, I would appreciate it a lot as well!

&#x200B;

Thanks a lot!!!"

"Start working remote, could you give me some advice?","Hi guys, I am thinking to start working remote for a new company but I am afraid of not being able to spend some time with other people and clear my head up. In my previous companies, I was always on-site, and while this meant for me to commute for almost an hour, I ended up having great professional relationships in and out of the office. Doing coffee breaks, team lunches, etc. Now I fear that this will no longer be the case as everything will be remote. Does this feeling happen to you as well?

I'm graduating from high school and I have no clue what I want to do. Do you guys have any suggestions based on what I tell you?,"Hey! So I have a lot of different interests. I also suck at commitment, so going to school for one specific career kind of scares me. Over the years, my career interests have included neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, art professor, physicist, and freelance artist. I love art, but I am also really good at math, and space fascinates me. The thing is, I hate doing math, even though I'm really good at it. I know that most careers involving space have a lot to do with math and physics, but I was looking into some involving the more biological side of astronomy (planets, life in space, etc.). I also really love art, but I know that that can be a difficult career path to pursue.

Anyway, I'm just looking for suggestions in careers/degrees that would be fun for someone who loves art and space, is good at math but hates it, and is super bad at committing to one type of work.

Quit job and want to change career. What steps should I take?,"Hi all

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I'm 25, and after much deliberation, I quit my job a few days ago. As a brief background, I studied economics at university for 4 years, then upon graduation spent 2 years in investment banking. I quit that job in March to pursue an opportunity at a renewable energy company in an attempt to align my job more with my values, albeit the role was still working within mergers and acquisitions and exhibited the same stressors as my investment banking job. I quit this job a few days ago without much of a plan, although I am in a fortunate enough position to be able to sustain myself for the next year or so.

Reasons I quit: - Work/life balance. Upon graduating, I was full of energy and was not daunted by the long hours that characterise the finance industry. This energy, however, soon disappated. With little personal time, I miss greatly the things I used to do for enjoyment, such as reading, drawing, rock climbing and spending time with friends and family. I also am not motivated by money or status, so I found it difficult to justify continuing my career path. - Changing personality type. Before picking my university degree subject, I took several Myers-Briggs tests and was coming out as a strong INTJ, which to my knowledge would make me suited to finance/analytical type jobs. I took the test several times again recently and I'm now coming out as a strong INFP! Of course, I try not to define myself by four letters, but I think the change in my personality type can go some way to explaining my low mood. Numbers no longer interest me like they used to. I am good at analysing and manipulating data, but I don't see it as the means to an end. Rather, I see analysis as a supplementary tool to further my understanding of how I perceive the world. Spending endless hours in front of a computer screen has really worn me down. I miss having frequent interactions with people and nature and have a preference for honesty/integrity rather than doing all I can to get a deal/project approved. - Mental health. My mental health has taken a huge dent over the past few years and I was approaching breaking point. I began to freeze at work and could not function properly. I believe I have high levels of anxiety and a low mood currently, primarily driven by the career I have pursued up until now. I don't perform well in a high pressure environment.

My high level plan for the future: 1. Take a few weeks out to relax, catch up with friends and begin to try and enjoy life again by doing things I enjoy. I also plan to start seeing a counsellor to discuss the difficulties I am experiencing in relation to my anxiety and low mood 2. Find a low stress, guaranteed 9-5 job that I can coast on until I figure out where I'd like to take my career next. 3. Once I know what I want to do next, take time to go back to school (if necessary) and pursue my ideal career.

What I ask from you: I am quite certain that I want to turn my back on finance, however I am struggling to generate alternative career ideas. I have not developed my skill set outside of finance, so nothing really stands out. I have a preference for a career in which people are the main focus and where there is an element of being outdoors. I'm not overly bothered about utilising my economics degree in some way, as I fear that most jobs that an economics degree lead to do not match my values or personality. Furthermore, I view my degree as a sunk cost so I am not concerned about ""putting it to waste"". I kindly ask you how I should go about determining what career I'd like to pursue, and equally if you have any career suggestions that you think I may like based on this post I would love to hear. I am to retrain for a year / on the job, but taking another 3/4 is probably a stretch too far.

Thanks again for taking the time to read my post!"
What are careers with no customer service?,"I’m currently an HR intern, and I really like it for the most part. However, I don’t like being called by angry people about complaints.

How damaging is it for me to leave a new job to accept a more desirable job offer?,"tl;dr - I'm considering accepting a high-paying job but only working it for a month or two before accepting a lower paying job that would make me happier. Wondering what reasons exist not to do that that I may not have considered yet.  

I'm in the military with a gross annual income of about $92,000. I've decided to leave once my contract is up in early April instead of reenlist. I'm stationed in Maryland but I really want to move back home to Colorado, I've just been holding out for a decent enough job there. I figured it wouldn't be hard to land a job here in Maryland (basically doing the same job I have in the military but as a civilian) so my plan was to do that first just to keep paying the bills while I look for a Colorado job.

I interviewed for a Maryland job on Wednesday and a Colorado job on Thursday. Both sent recommendations to HR to hire me, and both hiring managers said this almost certainly means an impending job offer. Maryland job pays $118,000 and aligns perfectly with my experience, while the Colorado job pays around $66,000 and is a sort of partial career shift since it aligns with only part of my experience. Now you probably think I'm crazy for preferring the Colorado job but living there is my dream and I'm not happy here in Maryland.

Anyway, I *could* just accept the Colorado job and decline the Maryland job. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want to collect at least one month of that fat salary from the Maryland job (about $9,800 gross) before moving to Colorado to start the other job. And the Colorado job could probably be flexible with the start date by a month or two. But of course, that means I'd be having the Maryland company commit whatever resources to getting me spun up on that job only to quit soon after.

Both companies do a lot of government contracting work. The Maryland company even has jobs out in Colorado too, similar to the Colorado job I'd be taking. If I leave Maryland company so soon, do you think it will burn the bridge for any job opportunities with them in Colorado? Is there a way to mitigate that aside from NOT leaving so early? Do you reckon it could damage me professionally beyond my relationship with the Maryland company, like other companies finding out how I left that company?"

Realized I make LESS now than I did when hired 5 years ago. Now what?!,"
32M, BSA, 7 years experience in current role, 5 at current org

I’ve been in my position w current org for five years now. Over that time I’d guess my overall skills pertaining to this position improved 50%, and the job has undoubtedly gotten more complex.

I’ve only gotten positive yearly reviews and feedback. Last year I asked my manager (and his manager) what it would take to get to the next level, and was not given an answer, just lip service. Lack of path forward is a complaint I’ve heard from all of my coworkers, and as such we face increasing turnover.

To add salt to the wound, yesterday I compared my first paycheck in early 2015 with this company to the most recent paycheck and the difference is lesser than increase in inflation for that time period. That is, I effectively make LESS now than I did when I was hired. We’ve also lost some benefits and now pay more for healthcare, compounding this issue.

What next? Do I threaten to leave without a substantial raise, or do I just get out? Only issue is current job is walking distance from home, comparable position elsewhere would include :30 commute.

Yes, I should have addressed stagnant wages years ago, but the last few years have been very busy on a personal level and I just haven’t."
I want a different career but I am constrained by my experience and financial difficulties. I have no idea what to do or where to go. What can I do?,"I'll summarize my educational background as succinctly as I can. I got a bachelor's in neuroscience, and a master's in biotechnology. This was with the goal of getting into medical school, which did not happen. After a year of trying to get a job after the master's program, I got into a doctoral program for biochemistry. Due to a variety of factors, including the program director bungling up my qualifying exams, I quit the program after 3 years.

Since then, I haven't been able to find a decent job. My master's program director said I should command a job at least $20/hour, which has been proven to be a bald-faced lie or moronic oversight. I hadn't had a full-time job until this year, and only one paying that rate for two months. After leaving the doctoral program, I worked for 1 year at a grocery store, and 6 months at an overnight veterinary diagnostic lab. I've been at my current job for 2 months now, as a research assistant at a university. Despite promises, it offers no clear way up or any substantial pay increase whatsoever.

Now, here's where I'm having difficulty. I want to switch to a different career, but I have a few obstacles.

The first is money. I still have to pay off student loans, and I have no desire to go into even more debt for a pricey program that doesn't even guarantee a job afterwards. I already did that with my master's, and I have spent now more than 2 years job hunting for scraps. I'm not forestalling my life further playing this rigamorale in order to pay off loan shark, bloated debts.

The second is job hunting itself. The whole process is a joke, compounded by so-called professionals who give contradicting advice on how to write resumes, apply to these job boards, and whatever else. My university's career counselor is a quack with no idea what he's doing. Recruiting agencies like Aerotek either find me nothing or ignore me entirely. Networking events have netted me nothing. I have no idea where to go to get a career plan in place. Moreover, am I being ignored because I'm seen as inexperienced? A job hopper? I shouldn't be, considering I've had at least 3 years experience doing research, and my other jobs, while short, had to be taken or else I couldn't eat.

**Long story short**, I want out of my career field of research to find a decent paying job with some growth but I cannot afford more schooling (I'm still paying of my master's, thank you very much).  I have no idea how to navigate the fog of confusion and contradiction that is job hunting either. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. I'm nearly 30, and I'm scared stiff that I've pigeonholed myself into a dead-end career path that I can't escape from.

edit: made a few changes to the education part."
"I want my work to be meaningful to me, how do I make that happen?","I have been out of work for 18 months with mental health issues. During this time I have evaluated many different aspects of my life. This includes work. I'm loosely involved in the oil and gas industry, maximising profits for the companies owners, whilst simultaneously working in an industry that's having a negative impact on the environment. Plus I don't like the work and felt very stressed there. Definitely a contributing factor to my health issues.

I want to work in a field that better aligns to my beliefs. Either helping individuals, communities or the environment. 

I've considered health, setting up additional health services, efforts towards climate change - perhaps via developing new technologies or through research on the current ""mess"".

Limitations: likely can't work full time, definitely can't work shifts and not sitting behind a desk all day.

Education: degree in physics, PhD in computational mathematics

Because of my mental health I have lost most of the knowledge of my degrees, although I believe my skills are still intact: problem solving, communicating data to public, researching, and Python, Matlab, VBA.

I am not fit to go back to school, but can do a few courses on Coursera or similar to shift myself across. I had been looking at establishing myself as a data scientist, but have little interest since I've been ill. 

QUESTIONS:

How do I go about drilling down into where I think I'll fit and what will work for me?

How do I perform a better diagnostic of my current skills?

Can I do this work on my own or do I need an employer?
  - How difficult is it to get skilled part time employment?

I'm sure there are many things I haven't thought to mention and several other questions I wished I had asked, but at this stage any input will be gratefully received.

"Bachelors last year + 1.5 years job, should I (22F) pursue a masters degree I don't feel like I need?","Hi all, my mother is putting pressure on me to get a masters degree and I see her point, but I don't feel I need it. I will be 23 in December and I'm from eastern Europe.  
I was always a very good student and last year I got my bachelors degree with honours in Economics (from a respected EU public uni). During the last few months of my studies I started an internship for a very well known financial company, it was supposed to be something to get some experience and pay the rent but I ended up getting a permanent offer with a decent salary and I took it. My mother did not approve as she said I should have gone for a masters degree, but I convinced her to let me work one year to save some money and decide later on.  
Well that moment has come, I've been kepping the foot in two shoes so far and I have all the options open but I need to take a final decision within a month.  
I'm doing great on my job, and despite being obviously very junior I'm getting a little bit of responsibility, I'm being sent on business trips by myself, my boss likes me etc. I like the position but probably I won't want to stay in it forever.  
My mom's point is that without a masters degree I might encounter some closed doors in the future which I totally agree on, but then maybe experience trumps the qualification?  
I would not study and work at the same time, I have a demanding job in terms of time and commitment so it would not work. The masters degree is a 1.5 / 2 years commitment (depending on the thesis).  
I make decent money especially compared with friends my age who are either studying full time or working as waitresses and secretaries. My mom is ready to support my basic expenses for the duration of the master that is rent and basic living, but it would be a downgrade from having a salary since I would feel bad spending too much if I don't earn the paycheck. Family is not very wealthy but we do more than ok money wise.  
  
I really don't know if I should give up this job where I'm (I think) kept in high consideration and the company is one of the world's top institutions. On the other hand, what if few years from now I want to develop into a position requiring an higher degree? Or I want to go live abroad and they don't consider me for that?  
  
EDIT: thanks so much for all the good and motivated advice!! Just to clarify I'm not talking about an MBA but an MSc, or however it's called the natural progression of a Bachelors, and it would not put me in debt since education is nearly free in my country. I think I will do as it was my idea and work few years then when I have more clear ideas go for higher education, it's the best way to go and mom will get over it soon enough (and unleash her overprotective wrath on my little sister who's coming of age!!)"
Hating corp jobs but not sure what else to do?,"I feel as though I am suffocating in the corp world. I dread going into the office and it's not even for a reason other than being trapped and just not happy. I am so bored and yes I can ""switch"" jobs but I already have done that 4x and I just find no fulfillment in these stupid corp jobs. I find myself jealous of labor jobs like the custodians or the landscapers because it's like you have a more tangible impact and can see results of your work. I don't even know if 9-5 even exists anymore because every corp job I've held was always 8-5 and when you commute on top of that, your entire day is gone and energy as well. 

My friends/family just say go back to school or change careers but do people really thing its that simple? When I used to work as a recruiter it was almost just thing stamp that that was ALL I was and even when I networked it was all people wanted me to step into a company as. I hated recruiting and fell into the maybe I could get into HR from being a recruiter once I got in with a company, this has NEVER been the case. 

Now I am at this point were I just can't get myself to go in anymore but whats the alternative? I can't really think of a job that I would enjoy more that would pay decent. Money isnt everything but end of the day, I am alone and can't just not pay my mortgage and I do not have family that could help. 

I hate that I live for the weekends and then the weekends come and its chores and then decompressing from work then going back to work and feels like I am wasting my life. I realize my happiest part of the day is coming home to my dog. It'd be great to work with dogs, but I applied to a few dog places and 1. I don't have experience and 2. Its almost a red flag to places that I am at a high level job wanting to be a dog walker. 

I'm an introvert and every job I look at is so involved with other people and I just want to keep to myself and just complete tasks. I don't particularly have any ""skills"" and just have a bachelors of science in psychology. I have no clue what other alternatives are out there that are feasible. 

I am I know probably everyone else out there wishes that they could just not work or work part-time but I feel like at every job I have, after 1-2pm I just zone out. It's almost pointless to pay me because I have no attention left for the bullshit. I have no problem working hard and used to work 13 hour days back when I supervised a retail store, time flew and I never noticed. Now I just stare at a clock all day watching paint dry because its more interesting than whatever stupid pointless corp assignment I am working on. I wish I had ideas to even start my own business or something but with no ideas, skills or anything I just feel a bit defeated. 

I guess long story summed up, I hate my corp job but wondering what alternative freeing or work from home or on your own schedule jobs that pay decent. Seems like a stupid fantasy but honestly curious does anyone have a job that actually like and enjoy going to?

Recent college graduate with degree in biology. Discovered I hate academia and grad school isn’t for me. Go back to school for a trade? Push through with career using B.S. degree? Just look for advice please!!,"Recent college graduate with biology degree. Not sure where to go, especially in these weird times.

So I have a biology degree with a focus in ecology and conservation. I’ve had numerous internships and some research experience. I found in the past four years of university that I despise academia, so going back for grad school won’t be happening any time soon if I want to keep my head on straight. 

Personally, I feel the urge to go to community college and get a trade certificate...maybe I’m ungrateful for my degree, but I simply can’t see how I am marketable in the work force with the degree I have. I have learned that I’m a very hands on person, which is why I’m leaning towards learning a skilled trade.

On the other hand, I’ve also had an interest in GIS, so I could easily get a certificate in GIS which would pair nicely with my current degree. However, I have become quite opposed to desk work in the past year. 

All in all, I feel quite silly for the degree I got and further confused because I’m a much different person than I was when I started school in terms of work ethic...maybe I’m not different, but I certainly have learned more about who I am and what I think I desire out of life.

Thanks for simply reading through this little rant. Feel free to ask questions if you’d like to hear more about my situation/if you feel I’ve left anything out. 

TLDR: Want a hands on career. Not a desk job. Am I acting childish, or should I go back and get schooled in a trade?"

I've been in the office for 4 years now and I just don't know if I can sustain an office job without getting fat, anxious and miserable.   I'm half tempted to reach out to delivery truck drivers in my area, offer to buy them beers or coffees and try to get informational interviews.  I'm not very serious about it yet, but my gut says I should at least give it a try and see what happens.    

Does anyone have any success stories about leaving the office and going into manual labor?  I'm guessing it's not too common, but I thought I'd take a shot.

What's so bad about being a lawyer?,"A letter to unsure future lawyers


Given to me from my law/legal professor in undergrad. I told him I was on the fence to becoming an attorney, and he sent me this.

Mr. A,

I always tell my students that I am but one side of the coin of the profession of law. There are lot of downsides to this profession. To get there in the first place you have to generally expend a decent amount of money (college, LSAT prep and the actual test, applications etc.). Then you have to take out generally $150k-$250k to actually go to school. Your loans will be at a rate of 6-12% depending on how lucky you are, but in general the interest on those loans is going to be insurmountable unless you get a very high paying job and really sacrifice your quality of life for several years.

Once you've gotten there, the study is unlike anything you've done before - 14-18 hour days are not uncommon. Once you begin to practice, you are exposed to routine long days, verbal and mental abuse from your superiors and clients and all so you can make low 6 figures with the possibility to potentially make it out of the rat race and become a partner. Except, there are generally not enough jobs, despite the glut of attorneys and if you don't go to a top school, those opportunities may not be entirely available. If you do make partner, now you have the responsibility of not only running your cases, but also ensuring that your associates are making money for you and not tanking your case. You work weekends, holidays, birthdays, anniversaries - whatever the case and your superiors or your clients demand. There is high pressure on you to deliver the best possible result to your client, even if that result isn't necessarily possible given the circumstances of the case. Your client's problems become your own problems. You take your work home with you and expose your loved ones to the stress of the job.

If this doesn't sound like something you're prepared to do, then I would suggest not going. But, as I have said, there are upsides and I am generally on the very cynical end of the spectrum for attorneys. I tell you guys not to go because most of you shouldn't go. You don't know who you are, what you want in life, and how you are going to align your strategy to achieve those goals. Asking a 21 year-old to go off and make a decision about the next 40-50 years of their life is honestly a very fraught proposition. I tell students to expose themselves to the law - take law classes, talk to University alumni who are lawyers, go work in a law firm, go sit in on law school classes. Do everything you can to prepare yourself for what it will be like and if you like what you are being exposed to, then by all means, go and enroll. Generally, students don't know why they want to be lawyers - they just assume that it's the next step in their education without asking whether they want to do this job for several decades.

In my 2 years of teaching at university, only 1 student has proven to me that they are prepared for this in every way you should be before going. This is out of several hundreds of students that I have had now. So in that way, I suggest you look at some of these things and take them under advisement. If you enjoy your free time, low pressure etc., this is not a job for you, and that is not a bad thing to say or admit. It takes a very specific type of person to do this work and that doesn't mean that that type of person is a good person etc. It just means they are attuned to the type of life this will be. Every single person I have told not to go who went anyway came back to tell me that they regretted it. That's not to say that you don't come to enjoy certain parts of the job. But if you want to last in this business, you have to love it.

I tell students to take a few gap years and go work and learn about themselves. Go see the world. Go work in our government. Go teach English in another country. Go do the things you always wanted to do because once you become a professional - any kind - those opportunities begin to disappear. I have taken a total of 3 vacations in my 6 years as an attorney and I worked during all 3 of them. Go live your life - the law and law school will still be here if you've done all of these things and still want to go. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Does a 40 hours a week work get any better?,"So, I don't really have a problem with my job. Been doing it for several months now.

However 40 hours a week is really killing me. Looks like it just gets worse every month. Especially the mornings, I'm not an early riser.

Does it get any better over the years? "
Verbally accepted a salary offer that I feel is too low. Now I am unsure if taking the job is the right decision. Am I screwed?,"Hi all. I am an early career engineer (HVAC automation industry). Over the last several months, I have been interviewing for a new position with a different team in my company. This position is desirable because it will carry more responsibilities than my current role, and I feel it has better upward trajectory for my career. I would also be working on projects I care about (energy sustainability). At the risk of sounding dramatic, it’s one of the best professional opportunities I’ve come across. This week I received a phonecall from the hiring manager informing me I had been selected for the position, which is obviously exciting.

I am conflicted because I feel the offer they made for salary is too low for this role. It is a 6% increase from my current salary, when I was hopeful for at least 15%. Admittedly I screwed up negotiations by not broaching the topic during the interviewing process. I was afraid of losing out on an opportunity I wanted by bringing up the topic inappropriately, which I now know was a naive and incorrect (I’m still young and make mistakes) way to look at it. For context, the salary I’ve been offered for the role is similar in value to offers I had at graduation.

The reason that I feel the offer is too low is because of the increased responsibility I cited earlier. My role is currently purely design. This new role would carry sales engineering and project management responsibilities, in addition to design responsibilities. The role will also have me traveling 50-60% of the time to customer sites for field work.

In addition to all of that, changing to this team will require me to move 18 hours away. I will be giving up my girlfriend, my friends, family, professional relationships, and volunteering roles in my current area. I realize these are all personal items, but I feel it is important to note what I would be sacrificing to take this role. 

I’ve been told by the hiring manager and others in my life that “the money will come later,” but to me that feels  hollow. I’ve always been told that the best way to receive larger raises is by changing positions. And at the end of the day, life is not just about the job you work. Right now, part of me feels like I will be making a mistake to give everything up I mentioned just for a job if it’s not the salary I want, even if it is a very desirable role. 

What are everyone’s thoughts? Am I screwed since I verbally accepted (I haven’t signed any contracts)? Is it too late to negotiate? Is the increase actually reasonable, and I am just being entitled? Am I too “in my head,” and just getting cold feet about what is still the right decision? 

I apologize for the length, and potentially rambling nature of this post. I am very stressed and conflicted about this, and am just hopeful for some objective 3rd party perspectives. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds! I hope you all have a great holiday."
Work from home jobs?,"I am trying to plan my long term career and working from home would be ideal. I’m looking for weekends off and to be home with the dogs as much as possible.

I have not yet started college and I currently work a retail job with 10 hour days and working most weekends. They are flexible so at any point that I want to start college I am able to do so and keep my current job.

What work from home jobs have you (anyone) had/do you have and how much school goes into it? Do you work from a laptop or desktop? What do you do from home?"
"7 weeks into the job, I keep making mistakes and my colleagues have enough. Should I leave?","Hi, I need your advice. I recently graduated and got my first serious job. It's a bit repetitive and doesn't have much to do with my studies, but I can use French there, I like it, and it's good money. Then, I got a mail from the place I used to intern at with a job opportunity. I got it and been working there for 7 weeks. So now, I work 4 hours every day at my first job and 3 days a week for 8 hours at my other job. I was so happy at this opportunity as it's what I'd like to do. However, it's been pretty bad. There is so much work for me to do at this second job and so little time, I keep making mistakes. Besides, it's the first time I work the office job with so many tasks at hand. I feel like I learned the complete basics during my first month (for example, to write down everything I need to do – otherwise, I'll forget it), but it was already one month too late. As you can imagine, I make a lot of mistakes. A lot of them. The colleague I'm supposed to help told me recently I can't make any more mistakes, I've reached the limit. Because of all those problems, people at the office don't really like me (and I've never had people skills). I started to have bad anxiety concerning this job. It's Saturday, yet I'm afraid to go to this job on Monday. I feel like I'm too stupid for it and I have impostor syndrome. But on the other hand, I like what I'm doing there and it's really important for my career. There's no other similar place to work in my city. I know 7 weeks is not much time but the mistakes I make are all so dumb and the others expect me to make no mistakes at this point. So my question is, should I resign? Or should I keep learning, but also making mistakes until they snap?"
"If you had a good relationship with your boss, would you let him or her know that you are looking for another job?","For context, I have no complaints about my job other than an the unexpected 2 and a half hour minimum commute after the company (acquired company in a large single branded portfolio company, still being held by the acquisition company) last minute relocated the office. It used to take me 5 minutes to get from home to office before the relocation.

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has responded - a lot of great insight and advice and it's so appreciated!"
Is my boss bullying me?,"Update: I handed in my notice today! I feel so liberated! He was super nice to me all of a sudden too


I’ve posted about this before. I was hired as a social media executive (some events involved too) for a small business, reporting into the marketing director. When hired, she told me she would be going on maternity leave, but assured me it wouldn’t be long at all, she would be on call, and the Big boss would be around to pick up certain aspects of her job (which I have no experience in).

Cut to now, she has gone completely awol and we have found out she won’t be etirning until September, so that’s 7 months off! Bear in mind I’m paid a junior salary ($30,000)

I have been piled with a huge amount of work I have no experience in which is very technical, so have admittedly been struggling. As a result, my boss has been shouting at me for my lack of experience and the fact that he has to help with my job.

The other day on the phone, every time I said ‘ok’ to something, he would scream ‘stop saying ok!!!’ at me. 

When he gives me tasks, he also screams at me to ‘stop writing things down!!!’, as apparently I have to soak things in.

Yesterday, we had a meeting and he said he was going to create a presentation as I have a lot to do (and I have no experience of using the spreadsheet that has all the figures- I was actually told to not touch it). He comes into the office 10 mins before the meeting asking what I have prepared, and shouts at me in front of everyone for not preparing something.

He also screamed at me in front of everyone regarding a retainer contract my marketing director signed, but then proceeded to apologise as it was signed before I started.

This on top of him micromanaging everything I do and calling everything myself and my colleagues do shit, is giving me serious anxiety.

The weirdest thing is that he flips from being awful to very nice, so will take us to a really nice lunch after he shouts.

I’m going to hand in my notice mid-May as I seriously cannot take it anymore. I have plenty of savings so don’t really care if I have nothing lined up. I feel guilty about leaving when she’s on maternity leave, but now realise that is not my problem. 

I am also grieving at the moment (lostva family member to cancer) so it’s a struggle.

I’m quite a sensitive person however so don’t know if I’m overreacting? Would be good to hear your thoughts.

TLDR: manager went on maternity leave, I have been piled with work and my boss is screaming at me daily, leaving me with anxiety. But am I being too sensitive?"
"What's a good, steady career for an introvert who absolutely hates talking with other people?","I'm the kind of person who hates talking with other people. I'm typically polite and nice towards my coworkers, but talking to others stresses me out in ways more than any deadline could. 

I prefer eating lunch alone and taking walks by myself around the building. If possible, I would love to find a career where you could just come to work, sit at your desk, get stuff done, and then go eat lunch by yourself. 

Are there any steady careers that can provide that kind of introvert lifestyle?"
Working 2 full time jobs. How to avoid burnout?,"Long story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I’m learning how to manage money better but I’m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home. I figured it would be way better to alleviate the debt first, while also learning to handle my money better, before setting off on the path of independence.

I decided to pick up a second job, and it turns out it’s full time. I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I’ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I’ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up. (I’m on the lease with a parent). My hours are pretty much sun up to sun down (17 hours), roughly 5 hours of sleep in between days. I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I’d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably. I’m afraid that this mindset will lead me to quit the second job once this motivation inevitably dissipates during times of weakness. So my questions are as follows:


What are your tips to avoid burnout?


Are there any tips to make standing on my feet for 15 hours at a time more bearable?"
How do you deal with decision fatigue?,"As I reflect back on my life, I'm reminded by just how far I've come. This time last year, I wasn't too happy. I was in a dead beat job, and while I'm still not where I desire to be, or my friends are at, I'm slowly matching the gap. I guess, how do you guys decide what you are going to do in any given day, or in regards to your job. I often find myself thinking that perhaps maybe I should of went to a better school, which would've allowed me better connections. But then I'm reminded I graduated debt free. I wish I took this job offer, so I could gain more valuable experiences, but I stayed behind since I wasn't sure if it was necessarily better for my career. I do this so often. Even clothes. I didn't grow up rich, and we had enough to scrape by. But that mentality and feeling had carried me on. I have nice clothes that I've attained over the years, but I prefer comfy clothes, since I'd rather deal with washing clothes I don't care about, because if I wore nice clothes, I'd feel I waste them. Now I'm not insane, or crazy, I still get out of bed and I'm not depressed. I'm in a good place, I just wonder if things would of turned out differently if I worked harder or maybe lazier, so to speak. I wonder if I maybe left home later how my life might turn out different. It's kind of bizarre when you think about it. Am I the only one that feels this way? Please tell me you think about this as well. Thanks in advance for reading."
"How could I ever get into these ""jobs for history majors"" I see on internet lists, it feels like I'm so unqualified for anything?"," I see all these jobs like ""human resources personnel"" or ""market analyst"" or ""growth hacker"" or ""event planner"" or ""paralegal"" and they all sound fine and dandy, and I'd be ok with any of those and I feel very confident I could do them if I were trained, but if I look at positions online it's always ""have 25 years of experience and a degree in an ultra specific field of finance!"" I am exaggerating of course, but even so it still seems hopeless. It feels like I am qualified for nothing. I'm great and reading and writing and research and all that, but they all want different degrees. I feel like I might be able to convince someone to hire me if I could get in front of them, but that is much easier said than done. My resume is so shit I doubt I could ever get to an interview."
I keep getting fired from corporate jobs…what is my next career move??,"I am getting really frustrated and disappointed in myself. I am unable to keep a job that pays me enough to make a decent living. I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past. I also have creative talents that I would like to explore further and see if they translate to something I am better suited for. Please let me know if the community could recommend a decent paying career path that would highlight my skills and incorporate some of the things I am passionate about. I could also be interested in going back to school if necessary, (and if the debt required to do so isn’t too outrageous). Also, does anyone think remote work might be a good option for me?

"Fired from first Career Job, how should I proceed?"," (Cross Posted in personal finance for questions about the pay)

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to ""poor culture fit"" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to ""I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group"" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or ""I was asked to leave for"" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

I'm really lost, I'm really depressed, and I don't know what to do, because at the end of the day, being an engineer was extremely boring, and I didn't like what I was doing, but I'm not really qualified for anything else since I was so early in my career."
How can I talking to my boss about excessive travel?,"Hi all,

I am a software developer for a large consulting firm. I was told during the hiring process that it would require up to 50% travel which I am okay with. However, I am currently on a project that requires me to fly 700 miles to the client site 4 days a week every week. I leave my house for the airport every Sunday at noon and return home every Thursday around 10pm. 

I love my job but the traveling but being away from home for the majority of every week is mentally and emotionally draining. This position is perfect for me in every way except for the heavy travel requirements. My current project will be wrapping up soon and I am trying to decide how to approach the topic of traveling less in the future with my manager. 

My boss is a fantastic person and he really cares about his employees. I feel like I could talk to him about this, but I don’t want it to reflect poorly on me or come across as laziness or insubordination. 

How would you suggest approaching this situation?


Thanks!"
I have no Passion?,"Hey all. I’m switching careers, because I’m very unhappy and burnt out working with older adults.

The problem is I don’t really have any passion. I’m not passionate about anything. There’s things I like doing; reading, listening to music, watching tv, but I’m not passionate about these things. Just things I enjoy.

I’ve been spending hundreds of hours after work studying coding, because I want to switch into this career. Coding, reading, watching vids, podcasts, articles, etc. But idk if that counts as being passionate or not.

I find coding interesting, challenging, sometimes frustrating.. but aren’t you supposed to feel pumped up or something if it’s a passion? Like “F*** YEAH, I’M GOING TO CODE SOMETHING!!!”

Do you need to be passionate about a career? Can it just be something low-stress you do & then do things you like in your free time?"
Should I Quit My Steady Job In Order To Focus On My Mental Health While I Look For Something Better?,"Basically trying to make a long story short, in March I quit a job that put me in a very toxic and unhealthy work environment publicly, and took the first job offered to me in order to get out of the spotlight of 8 months of 24/7 harassment. Now, 8 months later I am the most depressed I’ve ever been, anxiety has completely stripped me of my appetite to the point where I’ve lost 10 pounds in the last two months. Every morning I wake up sick to my stomach because I dread my job. I hate what I do, I don’t care about either industry my job falls in, I am given zero resources from my superiors, with unreasonable expectations. I don’t have a background in this industry. I am so utterly lost. Working home alone stuck to myself all day doesn’t help either.  

For the past two and a half months, the only thought in my brain has been “just quit.” As far as I see it, having no job can’t possibly be worse than this horrible anxiety and depression I feel every day. I don’t have the energy to pursue other work full force, I don’t have the energy to pursue anything creative that would make me happy.  I suppose it would be a bit different if I had officemates to commiserate with, or if I had a partner coming home every night, but the fact is I don’t. I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m afraid that “this is it” for the rest of my life without seeing a way out. And if “this is it” I can be honest and say this is not a life I can survive in much longer.  

I guess what I’m asking is, how irresponsible and stupid would it be to just quit without something solid lined up already? I’ve 7 months of living expenses saved (although I would HATE to deplete my entire savings), and I have a few freelance gigs I’m already working on (nothing that comes remotely close to my current salary, but I wouldn’t go immediately to zero income). 

Quitting would allow me to have the bandwidth to a) search for another secure job I’d be happier with, and b) expand my hustle for freelance work. I guess also c) pursue personal creative things I don’t have time/energy for now.  

I’ve been setting up meeting after meeting after meeting with different companies in my industry, but no one is hiring right now. I’ve learned I have a fabulous reputation, but there just aren’t any openings. But I can’t just wait around. Something in my immediate future needs to change drastically if I’m to keep surviving as I’m just so miserable and unhappy right now.    


Am I being dumb for seriously considering quitting? "
why is it so hard to make it out of poverty?,"fuck man, where do i start,

I’m the only engineer/designer at my company of 25 people. I’m getting burnt out. Is this normal?,"I work for a high end manufacturing company. 

We have about 4 sales people, 1 accountant, 1 graphic designer, 4 custom product technicians, and a whole bunch of assemblers. 

I’m the only engineer/product designer. 

I’m getting really burnt out with the amount of work I do. I do my own work alone (immediate design/engineering work, and 5-10year design/engineering work), some production work, and when the sales people are not around, I have to answer phone calls. 

I don’t think I’ll get another help. I’ve asked, but they only hire sales person. So I kinda gave up on that end. 

I’m passively looking to find a new job, but I’m worried if this is common in any small manufacturing company. I know that it’s pretty common in my current industry, but I’m willing to switch. 

I’m worried about running out of ideas. I’m worried about not being able to get my stuff done because of all the extra work I’m asked to do. I’m just not happy with the types of work I do."
"What's the etiquette when you like your boss (not your job) but have a better offer in hand? I don't want to burn bridges, but at the same time, this offer is too good for me to decline?","To give some background context, I work as a project coordinator. I've had some issues at my current company, but I'm acknowledged as one of its top-performing employees. I have glowing performance reviews, and my interactions with management from my direct supervisor all the way to the COO have all been positive. No one has a bad word to say about me. I've made suggestions for significantly revamping some of the processes in our project management office, and by surprise, some have actually been implemented.

However, I've been unhappy for awhile-- while acknowledged as a high-performing employee, I'm paid the same as coworkers who have not received the same accolades. My job description has expanded tremendously, and I've received the same raises -- in both timing and amount -- as colleagues who do less than I do. I was told I won't be promoted to project manager (the next logical step), but project plans, etc. that I've developed are used as templates by more senior members of our PMO. I'm even responsible for training newly-hired project managers on our processes. As a result, I feel extremely disrespected by most of the office's management team. The workplace is also toxic. New employees rarely last more than three months.

On a whim, I answered a LinkedIn message from a recruiter, and to make a long story short, I now have an offer letter in hand from another company. It's a significant pay increase (more than I'd make at my current job if I was left their pay increase schedule). My job title doesn't change, but I'd also be working in an industry with better long-term growth potential and higher salaries overall. While I like the offer and prospect of going to work for this new company, I also have a really good relationship with my current boss. I'd feel bad for leaving him in a bind, but it doesn't make sense for me to stay if my current company doesn't attempt to show that they value me. I also know that if I give them a chance to match, I'm most likely first on the chopping block. Why be loyal to me if I'm not loyal to them?

What's the proper etiquette here? Should I have a candid conversation with my boss and be prepared to give two weeks if it doesn't go how I need it to go? Should I just give two weeks?"
Does anyone think that networking has not been helpful to you at all?,"I am an introvert but I still network occasionally. I have some very niche hardskill and work in a super niche industry. I hate meeting people but I still make friends and go out to network. That say, I never think that networking has been pretty useful and it has never landed me a job. On top of that, I think the idea of networking is pretty disgusting as you can assume or feel most are networking to their own monetary benefit.

Either it is niche or it is 'still some endless entry job' dont really matter, nobody really look up at me, and somehow I am coming to the conclusion that networking is likely doing nothing to my 'career', if such career concept still matters.

I am growingly introvert as I become older, and most of the time I just want to be alone, despite I am talkative and very knowledgeable given the topic."

Of course, one screen is required, but is two screens better than one? Does it help your productivity or work more efficiently?"
Is it time to leave?,"I've been at a job for a while now and it was what many people would consider a 'dream job' in my industry. When I started I was super excited about it and was raring to go. Slowly over time I realized why the position I am currently in opened up. Employees keep leaving, at least one every month. The company is not big by any means, around 35 employees. There is a general unhappiness, anxiety, overworked, understaffed air about the place and this was even before COVID-19.

The pandemic has of course made things worse. Our salaries have been cut, which is understandable considering the situation but our clients have also lost some of their ability to pay us while we still bust our asses for them. This is what our boss expects, a lot of work and less pay. We have been told we should be grateful we still have jobs, in not as nice terms.

I'm privileged enough to be in a situation where I don't have kids, I'm not married, do not have a mortgage to pay or even rent. I wake up every day dreading work and wondering what is keeping me here. I'm normally not the sort of person who gets anxious easily but it's been through the roof lately. 

I wonder if I should cut my losses and leave now before this ship fully sinks or wait to see if things improve."
Why am I being told no?,"Four interviews since 1/20 and all have said no.  I am so confused. I look up questions and practice them. I show up early and I dress nice. I do a follow up if a week goes by. 


Two gave me feedback. They both said I did good and would be eligible for future hire but that another candidate fit the position better. One gave me an 8 minute interview and another was 10 minutes. Both were very basic questions. I felt like they just interviewed me because HR gave them my information. 

All four were in the medical field. I have work experience but not in the medical field. I had everything the job description required."
How do you deal with superior who hates you?,"My boss’s boss’s boss (VP of Sales and Marketing) hates me. I haven’t done anything unreasonable to affect him in a negative way for two years. I’m a sales rep and 99% of what I do is work on making sales and occasionally I will voice my opinion to my direct superior, the sales manager. For the most part I keep to myself. Two years ago I discovered a flaw in my boss’s boss’s boss’s plan for the company in opening physical retail stores and I told my boss. He directed the info to the CFO of the company and he saw the mistake. The VP thinks I tried to sabotage his idea and that’s why he hates me. He has been negatively affecting my work life every so often and I’m just wondering what precautions I could take."
28. Just finished xray tech degree. Not in love with it. Regretting it. Where do I go from here?,"Chose this field cause i enjoyed anatomy classes , but more so because i felt i was running out of time.  Its a minor pay raise compared to my current delivery job and much more stressful. All of a sudden i just don't want to be a slave employee anymore.  

I'm having business-type thoughts such as how i can make money while sleeping, investing, etc; even though i have no experience in this field.  I feel like i wasted my 20s figuring out how to make money without school, was unsuccessful so i caved and chose xray, and now my mentality is back to ground zero.  My girlfriend is an office manager and bartender and each of those match what i will make as an xray tech, and that frustrates me.

Do i uber just to network and meet people? Do i start streaming on twitch? My mind is all over the place. If i pursue an advanced modality beyond xray i'll make a few more bucks but most likely still be unhappy."
Take a job that sounds stressful and “just a job” to escape horrible boss?,"I have decided to leave my job of 5 years due to bad management and no growth, and received an offer for a higher paying job in a new industry. Here’s the thing -  the new job doesn’t excite me and might be more stressful. I have to get out from where I am, but worried I’ll hate the new job since it’s not an industry I’m passionate about. 

Do I take this offer just to escape now or try to wait it out for a job I’d be excited doing?"
"Would you quit a job after 2 years of zero raises, bonuses, benefits and overtime?",Is it wrong to feel like I’m being abused? This is not a small company that makes no money. They’re a F500 company leader in their sector and they give me the minimum compensation. They just keep giving me more work.  I’ve always shown dedication but it’s starting to feel like it’s a waste time.

"After making it on-site to an interview, doing multiple presentations, I was rejected. Now a month later, the position has been reposted. Is it a bad idea to reapply?","I asked for feedback from the recruiter on the initial rejection and whether it was my experience or interview performance that contributed most to the rejection. He said that the team simply went with another candidate.

It’s a very selective company, and I got pretty far, but I don’t wanna jeopardize my chances. Especially since I have another first round interview with them for a different role next week."
Introvert transitioning out of marketing. Can you help me find a path?,"28-y.o. Canadian with a BA in Communications and 5 years of digital marketing experience under my belt. I'm ready for a change. Churning out creative content leaves me mentally exhausted, and, as an introvert, I've always struggled with the soft skills. While my work is pretty good, I'm a lot slower than my coworkers.

I'm looking for an alternative career with decent prospects that doesn't require another 4-year degree. I'm drawn to jobs like librarian, researcher, technical writer, conservator, archivist, or prosthetic/lab tech. Do you have any suggestions for me? Thanks in advance.

**I like...**

* Research
* Independent work
* Writing reports, formal documents
* Organizing, planning, strategizing
* A slow pace and perfectionism (I'd rather do one big project well than speed through a dozen small ones)
* Working with my hands
* Living in a big city (I hear library jobs are tough to find unless you're willing to move)

**I don't like...**

* Lots of interpersonal interaction
* More than 75% of my day spent on the computer (I'm flexible on this, but things like programming and graphic design aren't for me)
* Writing creative content
* Travel
* Long hours
* Math, other than marketing analytics

**My top skills:**

* Qualitative research
* Analysis and overthinking stuff  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
* Writing
* Visual art and graphic design
* Attention to detail and organizational skills"
How do you survive working at a start up without burning out?,"I will be starting an exciting new entry-level job at a start up soon. It’s an amazing opportunity and I believe I am qualified for the job.

However, I’m a little nervous because I’ve never worked in a start up culture before. In your experience, is it any different from typical office politics?

What else should I expect aside from long hours and wearing “many hats”?

I just want to make sure I’m prepared and strategic so I can make the most of this adventure without mentally/emotionally/physically burning out.

Any tips or personal stories would be highly appreciated!"
I was devastated after a staff meeting - how to I move on?,"I started this job as an admin. I work with three people. One was hired right after me. Over the last three months, I've been told I've been doing a great job, but still have a ways to go (obviously after only being there three months). We had a staff admin meeting to discuss who was doing what and who was going to do what.

Before, the higher-lever work went to the two more senior admins (80%) with my providing assistance to them (20%) and the other person is still training. Now, the higher-level work were to be divided among my three coworkers and I am odd man out. Instead, my role is literally doing the grunt work. Instead of doing account management, I'm now responsible for grunt work like cleaning out the fridge on Friday and keeping the copier room tidy. I never felt so insulted and hurt. I have and can do more challenging work and am not sure why or how this was decided. It was a conversation I was left out of. I believe our bosses asked the senior admins for their input because they told me to be prepared to doing some grunt AND accounting work. One of the senior admin said that the new alignment would leave her overwhelmed and asked if some of it could be taken off her plate. She was quickly shut down instead of giving some of it to me. I didn't speak up because they would have shut me down too. No need to look stupid in addition to feeling upset.

I have so much more to offer and have proven it. I know I have not made as big mistakes as the senior admins did after their first three months. The head boss mentioned that if someone is screwing up all the time then you're not going to be giving this higher-level work and I couldn't tell if he was directing that comment to me. No one has said anything to me about any major and consistent mistakes on my end. Not one person. Even in the meeting they mentioned some of our shortfalls and mine were minor like missing a call as compared to my coworkers' mistakes literally costing the firm money. I was going to ask them if something happened to make them feel like that I can only do grunt work last night and I didn't because I was too upset.

I keep on telling myself that it's not like I'm going to be paid less to make coffee and won't need to stay late doing paperwork anymore. My sense is that people will start to ask why is I am being paid what I am being paid to make coffee and/or I'm too stupid/unwilling/lazy to do anything else. I will ask my boss and her boss on Monday.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not young. I am actually older than my co-workers.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Yes, there is some type of disconnect and I believe that it's because one or both of the senior admins are speaking on my behalf to our supervisors. One in particular. I started to cut that person off because I know I cannot trust her, but I was told that cutting people off at work would backfire by the other admin. The other two admins have made serious and costly mistakes when they first started and even recently (which was the reason why we had the meeting to begin with). Those mistakes were brought to their attention formally (closed door meetings with supervisors) as well as plans to prevent them from repeating those mistakes. I, on the other hand, have never had one of those ""closed door"" meetings. There were times when they mentioned to me casually ""hey, next time you take a message from XYZ make sure you ask them for both their cell and home phone"" or ""next time review the bill to see if anything on it looks off."" So when they're talking about people screwing up and being left out of challenging work, I cannot figure out if it's directed at me or to all of us. This troubles me because it can be inferred that they might taking the approach that I'm not worth fixing.

&#x200B;

Finally, I've had blunt conversations with my boss and her boss. I explained to them my anxiety and they assured me that I was doing fine, I am being way too hard on myself and (repeatedly, might I add) that if someone is going to be fired, then they would know it. They stressed to me they try to fix the problem(s) and I see that with current and past employees. They've mentioned that A LOT.

&#x200B;

TBH, I believe that people are right when they say I am not promoting myself enough. I also believe that I might have gotten blamed for things that I wasn't to blame for and am not aware of it and one of my co-workers needs to be cut off. Come Monday morning, I am going to be the first person in the office and speak to my boss and squarely ask her where do I stand and ask her how the choice/justification/logic was made to switch things up and even ask for some of the high-level work back. That is all I can do and keep my mouth shut.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have no intention to quit. I've had a few other jobs and this is still the best job that I've ever had. I am literally making $8 more dollars an hour, pay $0 for my benefits, close to home and the people are generally nice. It's stable, beautiful offices and I am grateful to be there. That is why it bothers me so much - because I do care about my job. I know the grass isn't going to be NOT on the other side. That is why I am willing to fight to make this work."
How do you approach applying for new positions after getting fired?,"Crossposting this to several subs so I can reach the widest audience possible. Reddit, I need some advice.

&#x200B;

I got fired today for excessive tardiness. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that I was in my position for several years, and after today I've realized that I was very much in a ""don't give a shit"" kind of place, mentally. I fully acknowledge I was fired for valid reasons and have no beef with my former employer, this was entirely on me (INB4 ""maybe you should just show up to work on time"" - yup, I know, and this will definitely be my primary focus as far as personal development goes).

&#x200B;

I held a corporate-level, senior SME/admin role, and I possess an extremely high level of knowledge and experience in a fairly niche field. I'm currently looking at some positions that could offer as much as a 50% pay increase from what I was making, in a similar or almost identical role, so obviously I was being underpaid - which I kind of knew already, and is probably the biggest factor in that ""don't give a shit"" attitude I had. I totally acknowledge that just getting lazy and not caring, rather than seeking a new opportunity, is totally my fault. But, now that I'm having this come-to-Jesus moment, I'm not sure how to proceed with future opportunities. Do I tell them I was fired for tardiness? Is it acceptable to decline discussing the reasons I left the company? How would this affect my chances for landing a new position, or salary/benefit negotiations? I appreciate any and all advice, insight, anecdotes, etc. If you have questions I'll try to respond as best I can. Thanks in advance."
Should I advance my career or live the chill life?,"I am crisis trying to decide what I should do. Currently I (37m) work a very high paying tech job that allows me to work remotely. I work from home in NYC. I own a house and live with my wife and 2 small kids. There is an in-law unit in the house where my sister and brother in law live. I make my own hours, I have full control over the work I need to do, and I do it well. I grew up in the east coast, I have a good amount of friends and family here, generally speaking life is pretty chill.
That said, I have hit the ceiling on my career. There is no room to advance and at this point it's not all that exciting. Working from home these past 7 years has felt pretty isolating. I miss the workplace community and interactions.
Now I have a job offer at a company in Seattle. It's a Sr position doing what I do now. It would be in the office every day with big expectations to solve some big problems. The total compensation is around the same as my current employer, but the catch is most of it is in salary, where as my current employer it is split between stock and salary. It's a great opportunity to work from an office again and take my career to the next level.
But I am really torn about this decision. Moving and starting anew in a city I don't have a lot of connection to. My wife has a bunch of family in Portland, so that's nice, but I will be moving away from my family. Working from the office means I will have less flexibility in my schedule.
I just don't know what to do. It seems like a great career move, but am I foolish for giving up a pretty easy life for this opportunity. Am I foolish for even thinking about moving away from my friends and family. Nothing is permanent, and we could always leave in a year or two if we aren't loving it.
I just don't know what I questions I need to answer for myself, so that which ever path I choose, either staying with my current situation, or moving west, I won't regret it and I can be at peace with it."
Why would somebody still hire me when I am 50?,"Let’s face it: the hiring market is not a charity organization, they will take the best / cheapest candidate where they have the best return on investment.
I am now in my 30s, with some decent work experience and I get invited to most of the jobs I apply for. Why would a company receiving 100 applications hire me when I am 50 for a job (not C-level) while they can find somebody in their 30s with the exact experience needed? What do I have to do to be employable then?"
I cry in the office bathroom everydqy. What can i do about the below situation at work?,"Since January, my social life at work has been horrible. It is impacting my work and I cry in the bathroom at work almost twice daily.

I have tried to think a lot why my teammates are behaving in that manner with me.

Earlier the whole team used to go for lunch together and I was included too. For tea/snacks some groups went together. I would join 2 girls at work. Since past few months, they lied to me that they are not going for tea but they did. They used to spend 30 minutes for tea and lie to me about that. I was fine with it. I tried to ask them for tea myself but they did not include me anymore despite my attempts. 
This has not escalated to lunch. They have stopped calling me for lunch from this Monday. So I have to sit alone the whole day at work. From what I see, one girl did not like me and it seems everyone is supporting and believing what she is telling. I honest have no idea what I have done. I tried to recollect my behaviour and actions and can't seem to think any wrong doing.

Can someone please suggest what I can do? I dread going to work now."
Did anyone use edX (online learning) certificates to bolster or change careers?,I am a Mechanical Engineer wanting to get into data science. Not sure if it's possible without getting a  college degree. 
Do coding boot camps actually get you jobs?,"I’m 36 and looking to start over in terms of career trajectory. Coding boot camps seem like a great way to fast track your education, but would I actually be able to pull down a job with one, as opposed to going back to school full time?"
Job for quiet person who wants to work their way up the ranks?,"I'm currently the assistant editor of a small but influential publication in my field of study. It's a small team (3 of us) so there's really no room for upward mobility at this organization; plus, I'm feeling ready to move on, anyway. Most of the job postings I'm interested in are communications/writing/project management/managing editor-type roles. 

The problem is, I'm a rather quiet, introverted person (but not shy). I tend to need a good bit of time and space to think things through and strategize. I enjoy talking to people one-on-one. I can do presentations and structured discussions well. But drop me in a group dinner where everyone is casually conversing and I get stuck in my head thinking about everything that everyone is saying and before long just want to go back to my hotel room and knit. However, I'm apparently pretty good at projecting confidence. On a recent work trip, my supervisor (who I don't work closely with at all) told me, ""You don't really strike me as the type of person who gets stressed out about things."" Which I found surprising and hilarious because that's pretty far from the truth.

Most of the jobs I'm interested in that have room to grow and reach higher, managerial roles require a lot of people skills. And I'm just kind of...awkward.

So my question is two-fold: are people-oriented, higher-powered jobs harder for quiet people, and if so, *what are some good alternative career paths* in the publishing industry or in communications for people like me who like people, and can play the part well, but who generally prefer to work with plenty of time to think and process independently? Also, are management roles harder to get if you're quiet?"
"Is there a website or something similar where you put in your degrees and skills, and it lists job titles that would be good?","What the title says.

What corporate job will be busy and needed through the aftershock recession?,.
Starting over at 44: am I doomed?,"So I'll be 44 this year, and I've been disabled throughout my adolescence and for all my adult life. I was diagnosed with autism at 42, and with ADHD at 43. Since entering treatment, my health has improved dramatically, and I'm now in a position to work towards things that I thought could only be dreams.

This poses a bit of a problem, since I have no idea what I want to do - or rather, I desperately wanted to study a language and then translate, but my home situation makes that difficult. I know that I want to go to university, but I have to decide what to study once I'm there, and what sort of work I not only want to do, but *will be able* to do. I'm educated to UK A-level standard, and am doing preparatory college courses to get me to the point I'm confident in my ability to tackle a degree.

I'm focused, driven and meticulous. I'm a problem-solver. I love data and detail. I love complex structures. I love puzzling out difficult things. I love going deep into one small field for years. I argue a lot, and I write well. I read very fast, and I'm a good researcher. I read Acts of Parliament and draw graphs for fun. I like numbers and logic. I do basic coding in around ten languages, and I use this constantly to fix problems around me. I do Japanese fan translations. ***I'm a learner*** - I love to study. Even at my worst, I've always worked to be better.

But I also have serious issues around my health. I can't do hard physical labour. I can't work routine long hours. I can work with people, but I'd need longer periods of working by myself. I put myself across well in writing, but in speech I come across as confused and inarticulate; I don't deal well with people. I have issues with memory and attention that make me prone to constant errors. I don't want to spend too much time in front of a computer, because it detaches me from the world that I need to be *in*, if I'm ever to accomplish anything in any job. I'd like to be able to work from home some of the time, but not all of the time.

I know I want to get a degree, just because it rankles that I've been to uni twice and don't have one. But I'm afraid that I'll take the risks, lose a lot, and still be unemployable at the end of it. I'll be in my 50s by the time I'm looking for work, an age when most people are terrified of losing their jobs because they'll never be rehired. And I don't know what my disability issues will look like in five years. I hope many will improve, but I would be a fool to think that many won't.

Am I fooling myself to think I can start out in a profession in my 50s, with no work history? Are there even careers for people like me?"
Is it career suicide to quit my job to work at a comic book store?,"Context: I’m 27 and I make 49k. Household income including my wife  is currently 145k

For the last 2 years I’ve been a Business Analyst at an online tech company. I love the idea of the job but in practice I am constantly stressed at work and always take that stress home with me. 

I’ve looked for BA jobs at other companies but the job listing for an entry BA are very similar to my current role (company wants a ninja that can project manage for minimal pay) I’ve been questioning if I want to continue as a BA. so for now I’m trudging along at work, miserably. 

I have some ideas about non BA jobs I can transition to with my experience but every position would at least require a certificate. I’m having a hard time studying because of the constant onslaught of work stress. 

My local comic book store has an opening for a cashier. I already love the staff there and comics have always been a passion of mine. Part of me wants to take the job at the comic book store for a year while I work on myself (therapy, medication, etc.) and decide what I want to do with my career and get the credentials I need

Comic shop job only pays 8.50 and has no healthcare. This would take our household income down to 114k per year. We have no children and can easily live on 114k but it will significantly impact our retirement savings. Am I crazy for considering such a significant pay cut? Am I nuts to leave a tech job when I don’t have a tech background? Do I need to suck it up until i find a job that actually moves my career forward?"
"Boss said he'd fully support me for an internal promotion, just informed me he's applying for same promotion. Shitty or illegal?","I'm currently working as assistant director and a position opened up for a director spot in another department. In order to apply, I had to tell my direct supervisor (my director) that I was interested in the position. So I did. He told me that he thought that I'd be an awesome fit for that position, that he would recommend me, that he'd fully support me going for that role, and that he wasn't interested in the position for himself. 

I applied for the position before the closing date (along with submitting an updated resume and portfolio), came into the office from paternity leave and interviewed for the position (2 weeks ago), and just submitted an assessment (spent about 35 hours putting it together) for the position today.

My director pulled me aside just before i submitted my assessment to tell me that he wanted to apply for the same position and that he wanted to ""clear the air"" around it and ""may the best man win"".  Along with that he told me that he had pitched a new position above the one that we are applying for and got rejected and that was one of the reasons he was now applying. He also said that he had been given the same assessment task.

A few other things really got me pissed even more:

* The deadline to apply was 3 weeks ago.
* I'm not sure if he had to actually apply and interview before being given the assessment but it sounds like he didn't.

I just want to make sure I have an even playing field and I'm not getting dicked around. I have a good rapport with the individuals doing the interviewing and evaluation of the assessments who are outside of the HR department. Should I bring up my concerns to them or should I go straight to HR with my concerns? Is what he's doing just shitty or is the special treatment he may be getting potentially illegal?"
Is happiness important for a job?,"I am an accounting graduate, worked in an accounting firm for about a year. I have a strong urge to quit because of the toxic environment. All seniors there would constantly pile work on the juniors with minimal guidance while they are able to leave work early. Any correspondence with clients is done via juniors as well. The seniors would always hide behind the juniors in case anything wrong happens with the decisions they made. My senior in particular does not treat me with respect or professionally and would always talk to me with sarcasm. An example of a situation would be when I asked her for guidance for consolidating accounts. Her response was, ""Wow i cant believe you dont know this"" and proceeded to ignore me. 

I have friends and family that asked me to leave to find a happier place as they noticed that i was really demotivated. My colleagues on the other hand asked me persevere and stay. 

Is happiness important to a job? Should I continue or resign?

PS: the turnover here is high. We would have 2-3 resignees every month."
What're some good careers for a 53 year old single mother to pursue? (My mom)," Hi, my mom's 53 and she has really bad arthritis in her hands and hips which she can't get surgery for because she can't miss work. It's gotten to the point where she can't even hold a pencil. I help around the house a lot but she works so much hands on labor that it's terrible. She's working 6 days a week at 2 jobs. Those being a ""chef"" at a local gas station (not really a real chef. She just makes eggs, pancakes, and stuff) and a cleaning lady. She's usually working around 8-12 hours a day counting both jobs and the day she has off, she babysitts my 2 year old nephew. We don't have a lot of money. Our family's income is below 30,000 and I don't want her to stress more when my sister and I leave since there's gonna be more manual labor around the house. I'm about to be a senior come September and my sister's gonna be a freshman too. So I was wondering if there's ANY decent careers she might be able to pursue that'd be cheap and that could possibly work with her schedule? I know it's a long shot, I'm just desperate for her. She's always wanted to be a vet since she loves animals (more than anybody I know), she loves learning about crime, is really into medical stuff, loves helping children and the mentally disabled (since her nephew has autism), and even loves tattooing (she was a tattoo teacher at a VoTech school before the arthritis.) She dropped out of college and always says if she had the chance again she'd finish it. So I just want her to have that chance. Any answer is helpful, she'd love any job that paid decently where she didn't have to work 24/7."
All goes well with phone interviews but when they meet me in person - no go. What am I doing wrong?,"I’m an older woman with lots of experience in Project management, a job description where there are good opportunities. My skill set is well rounded with lots of Admin. I don’t feel like I’m being disingenuous on my resume, but dates of graduation and a few of my earlier jobs are omitted. I get quite a few interviews, luckily, but I can tell the recruiter or hiring manager is a little unsettled when I come in for a chat. I get a lot of interview experience but that’s about all. No offers. 

I feel like my next move should be to go to an employment agency and lay it all out there, what I’ve been through with this ‘issue’ and see what they say. But since their real mission is to work for the employer, not the applicant, I’m not sure if this will backfire and they won’t waste their time with my application. 

I’ve updated my look and am really upbeat when I show up. I’m sure I’m projecting my enthusiasm to want the position and how hard I’m willing to work. Has anyone overcome this situation? Any advice?"
Dear Hiring Managers: What do you hope to gain by asking for an applicant’s greatest weakness?,"I would imagine you have to know the answer you get is not going to be truthful.

Has anyone moved on from a career you wanted really badly because nothing ever worked out no matter what you tried?,"I chose a career in the medical field because I truly love studying the human body and wellness. Problem is I’ve been so miserable that after completing school and failing to get a job in my sector I turned to research in a corporate setting. I’m treated very well at my current job and I get just about everything I ever want but could not get from healthcare (respect, opportunity for advancement, and mentorship). Honestly I could not handle the bullying and I broke down at the end of my schooling but managed to graduate on time. Has anyone experienced this? How did you continue trying or just move on?

*If I could get in to my field my earning power would go up drastically and I could work for myself after a few years of learning everything. I acknowledge that I would probably be miserable but at least I could do want I want after a while.
*At this point I’ve don’t two years of clinical research at two different universities and neither wanted me or advocated for me. In contrast I started my current position in August and I’ve already received a raise and bonus, pay for private leadership coaching, and they’re going bananas because I’m willing to learn how to model/code their health related data."
What Does the Typical Day in The Life of a Business Analyst Look Like?,"I'm just curious as to what a typical day looks like for a business analyst. I've had four years lower level management experience and one year upper level as an operations manager. I will be completing my degree in Business Analytics in 3 months. 

I already know what they do generally (according to college which isn't always reality), but I'm looking for more meat and potatoes type stuff and a typical day on the job. 

Thanks!"
Anyone else had post job search anxiety?,"Over the past 4 years I've spent the better part of 2 years unemployed, with the other 2 years with a company that became a hot bed of mismanagement and exclusionary bullying. After leaving that job I spent another 6 months looking for work. I've now started a part-time role but I can't seem to shake my unemployment anxiety, with constant feelings of inadequacy and fighting this constant urge to give up and quit at the slightest inconvenience (which is uncharacteristic, I have 3 degrees) . Anyone else ever experienced this? Is it normal/ have a name?"
What are the best resources/sites for finding career ideas?,Having trouble finding a path I can follow. 
How do you look for a good team culture?,"I'm a programmer.

I've had various programming jobs that paid from about $50k to about $130k.

Money is not very important for me. It's usually already sufficiently high.

I find the team culture to be more important:

* Are the coworkers friendly?
* Is the manager/lead easy going, sharing fun stories?
* Do you have to be on a call with angry clients?

Usually I ace the interviews with my experience, but I don't get a good perspective on what the team culture is like.

I learn about it quite quickly after a few days of working there, and interacting with everyone.

I've gotten very lucky, and very unlucky. (Currently going through the very unlucky phase unfortunately, and looking for a way out.)

Anyone have experience finding out how the team culture, before you started the job? How do you look for such a thing?"

"Didn't get promoted due to nepotism, or favoritism at work. How should I adress the issue?","I migrated to Canada last year from India. After submitting my resume to about 25 different places, I was finally able to land a job 6 months ago. I work at a Gas station/Travel centre as a cashier. Fast-forwading to last month my supervisor employed a new cashier, and this new employee is her sister. I did'nt have any problem with that, infact I am helping her to learn about the job. However, yesterday I was informed that the new girl would be taking position of the night shift supervisor(I usually work night shift) and she is undergoing training for this. I was in shock as I was the person who deserved this place as, I was the one managing the night shifts and doing most of the work.

Should I leave my job of 7 years?,"Obviously this is up to me and what I see valuable but I would love to hear some opinions.

Here are the details:

Been at my current job 7 years. I'm 29. Started at the lowest rung now I'm in inside sales. Not only do I do all inside sales jobs functions as everyone else, but I also have about 8 other duties.

I do not see a pay raise nor a promotion in the near future. Shit, I haven't seen a pay raise in the 3 or 4 years I've been in this position. I tAlked to management about this and had a document typed up with everything I've done and taken on. How much money I've saved and how much wasted time has been saved... This triggered them to give not only me, but my full group a cost of living raise. This is all I've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. I was pissed because I specifically went to them about why I am worth more... We're all paid equally but they have one job where I have about eight. Not only that but I HAVE RUN 3 DEPARTMENTS AT ONCE INBETWEEN HIRES. They just keep piling more and more ""projects"" on me, that adds to my full time duties. 

Now that's the bad...here is the good:

I'm salary. I have 3 weeks vacation. Never work overtime. I live 10 minutes from the office. As long I work my 8 a day I can come and go whenever. Get here at 7, no lunch and leave at 3? Cool. Get here at 8, take a lunch and leave at 5? Cool. You get it. If I need to just leave, no problem. Cool people too. 

Here's the big one they hold over your head...it's employee owned. In the 7 years I've been here I own more than $90k in stocks....without putting a penny into it. I also have my 401k which they do not contribute to.

Anyway, sorry for the bit of a rant. 

Am I just feeling entitled? What would you do in this situation? I've pretty much given up on fighting for a raise. I've plead my case with clear numbers and research...its just not gonna happen. 

As much as I want to search for another job, I'm worried the grass will not be greener.

Thanks for reading everyone.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. Was not expecting this many honestly. I'll get back to everyone once I have a bit more time!"
"Is it worth paying for a ""professional"" resume writer and LinkedIn profile ""designer?""","I've been hearing from multiple people that it may be worth paying someone to edit or write my resume and LinkedIn profile. It seems odd, but a small price to pay for potentially landing a solid job.

How do you control anxiety?,"So, my background is that I graduated back in June 2017. Joined as Business Analyst at a financial services firm, worked for 10 months and the left to join an old professor of mine as a Research Intern for a year to get an in-depth look at the analytics domain.

How did you break into your first management job?,"Healthcare specifically, but any advice from any field is appreciated!

I have been working in a hospital for 5 years in an allied health career. I’m extremely organized and self-sufficient. When there are workflow changes, or new software additions I always learn quickly and coworkers come to me for help. I get along with everyone but I’m not an extroverted person, and can’t play the office politics game very well. 

There is a girl who started the same year I did who already has a lead position by basically having the social skills to impress the director. She has the same education I do and one less certification than me. She is not respected by coworkers and people have to pick up her slack. How do people just *know* how to work the politics of a job?! 

I am craving more responsibility and don’t want to break into another industry and have to start over in my career. What bachelors degree would be best for me to obtain? I am considering an online healthcare management program. Are there are any other similar degrees that would be beneficial to advancing my career and augment my existing experience?

Right now none of the higher ups have advanced degrees. It’s like a big social club in management and they all moved up the ladder before degrees made much of a difference. Another concern I have is I am 26. What advice does anyone have for a young-ish person looking to break into administration? 

Thank you in advance!

"Been teaching myself to code, need a job but probably not quite skilled enough yet to be hired as a developer. What should I do?","I've been teaching myself various coding skills like javascript, CSS, react etc.  I don't think I'm quite at the point yet where I could make it as a developer, but I have a strong foundation.  I really need a job, and while I could just go get any old job I'm worried that if I'm not doing something coding related I'll loose the skills I've worked so hard to develop.  I'm kind of in this limbo zone where I'm not good enough to be a fully fledged developer, but can't afford to do anything non coding related for aforementioned reasons.  Some people have suggested a development internship, but all of the listings I've found for those are for people currently working towards a CS degree, which I'm not.  What should I do?

"Graduated college almost 3 years ago, but I haven't gotten into my field yet. Did I miss the boat? Am I still competitive?","Hey, Gurus. In June 2017 I graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in Information Technology. In the months after I sent out lots of applications, but never made any headway; a lot of denials, a handful of interviews, and even 3 precious last-round interviews, but I never managed to seal the deal with anything. Now nearly three years later, I'm wondering if it's too late. Can I still compete in today's market with an aging degree? Can I leverage my 7 years of customer service experience and 5 years of leadership roles in my favor? Should I just suck it up and live the Walgreen's life?

Former Direct report promoted over me-How to stay until I am vested in my pension?,"I work for a local government as a Manager in Finance for the past four years, CPA, MBA.   My boss never really liked me and will be retiring in a few months.  I just found out that one of my former direct reports will be assigned a deputy director position in my department.  I wont be directly reporting to her but she will be now above me.    My boss hasn't told me yet, but I am concerned over how to handle it.  I am 55 and the person promoted over me is 32.  I have a year and a half to go before I get vested in the pension plan.  I am pretty popular with my staff but the fact that management has not told me is concerning.  My staff is beginning to find out, this is the second time I have been passed over, and last time I think my employees (Civil servants) complained to management, which also can cause me problems.    I am  an at will employee, so I cant 100% be assured that my job is safe.  I am so scared to discuss with my boss for advice.  Can probably go to another manager for advice, but it will all go back to my boss or people above her. What should I do?  I also requested and received a 5% performance increase last year along with a cola of 2%, which is a lot for the local government.  I think there is some support for me above my current retiring boss.  Help me!!! I don;t want people to feel uncomfortable around me and would like to stay to get vested at least, if not longer."
What is the best way to resign from my job and leave on a good note?,"Basically for the sake of getting money to pay bills I accepted a job offer as a casual sales assistant, I hate it and can’t wait to leave. Im in my third month about to come off my “probationary period.” I recently received a better offer from another company and I accepted. What is the best way to resign from this current job. After getting to know my manager and co workers in this short period of time I feel the manager and coworkers would take it personally and not well. What makes things worse is they currently have a few people leaving and resigning and the team isn’t big it’s a small store but they are in the process of hiring new staff. I would ideally like to leave on a good note and would offer two weeks notice even though I am casual and don’t have to give any.  But two weeks is the maximum amount I can give. As it already clashes with my new schedule. I have work tomorrow at my current job and I want to give notice as soon as possible I just don’t know how."
At what point will being older affect chances of getting a job?,"Hi everyone,

I got off to a late start in my schooling. I have a 2-year diploma in Social Service work and will likely be 31 years old when I obtain my Bachelors degree. I may also go for a Masters, which would make me even older.

I have heard that it can be harder to find jobs when you are older and I worry about job prospects when I do start applying for jobs in the field. 

I'd like to work with marginalized populations in some capacity. I'm especially passionate about mental health and poverty. Would being in my early-mid 30's be off-putting for employers?"
"In your opinion, which has the more likelihood of getting an interview; applying on a job board (such as indeed or angelco) versus applying on the company website directly?","While I do a combination of both, I wanted to know which gave me the more chance of getting my application seen. Obviously if I come across a job posting on a job board list website, their website is hiring for the role itself. But which would get my application to the top, so to speak? 

Thanks in advance y'all."
"I was fired, but don’t know what I’m supposed to learn from this experience or what to say in interviews?","I worked in a nonprofit in a marketing and communications role. I study graphic design on the side and used those skills for my job. They never had anyone do this before so it really enhanced the work. I asked during my 6 month review if I could use the material I designed for my portfolio, and my manager said yes.

However, a year later, she found the material I designed for the company on my personal website and I got fired because of this for going against a related policy. 

However, the real reason is because I was unhappy there and my boss and I didn’t have a good relationship as I felt she was very autocratic and was not open to change or my input. There was many times she would
dismiss my ideas. There was a few times we had conflict/tension which is why I believe I was let go. Actually, a week before I was fired, I voiced my concern to hear about not feeling I have any input or that my opinion was valued, and a week later, she fired me. HR also told me in the termination meeting that I outgrew the role. 

In the end, I learned what kind of work place culture and management style I like (trust, autonomy, growth and not distrust or micromanagement), but how do I explain this in interviews since they you should never bad mouth your former employer and what do I tell them about why I was fired?


Really struggling about this.

Anyone started their first real career after 30?,"Late bloomer here. I spent my 20s working dead-end office jobs and getting my 2nd degree. Now I am 30 and ready to start a new career that is coding(really confident with the languages as I self taught for 1 year) related but not software development. I look younger than my age in general.

Should I be anxious about starting my first proper career now? I know we all have weaknesses/deal breakers that people judge, but we need to respect ourselves first before others could respect us. I know exactly what strengths I am selling to employers and am confident with it, but I still feel a bit anxious due to some regret of not having conformed to the usual career timeline of a ""typical"" person.

I am a bit of a perfectionist and do overanalyse things, so that is why I am anxious. I haven't started looking for new entry level jobs yet, but time is certainly up.

Please do share some similar positive experiences.

What jobs can I get with a Masters in History?,"Hello everyone,

I'm 29 years old with a Masters degree in History and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Digital Curation.  In spite of this, I am having a lot of trouble with landing a job.  In the past I have applied to entry-level positions in museums and libraries, very rarely have I been interviewed for any of the positions I've applied for, and when I do get an interview, somehow I mess it up.

I could use a lot of help.  While I would love to be able to work in an archive/library/research setting, I feel incapable of finding that job.  Given the amount of rejections, it is more and more difficult to be positive about my chances of finding a job in this field.  I was wondering if anyone here had some advice for me about getting a job in information services.  I'm also open to suggestions for alternative career paths.  Thank you."
"How should I handle ""why do you want to move"" question when just 4 months in a new job?","I've almost 2 years of work experience as a Business Analyst. I left a very comfortable job in a reputed MNC to work for a ""fast growth"" start-up. The major attraction for this was that it came with a fancy international relocation. I figured it'd be an interesting challenge to work in a start up and in an international office, something radical that I can only do in the early stages of my career.
However, just two days before I was supposed to join, they told me that my relocation is on hold temporarily and I should start working remotely from my home with frequent travel to the actual office. This was supposed to be temporary for a maximum of two-three months. However, it's close to four months now and no updates on the relocation. I'm getting very frustrated with remote working because it's not at all what I signed up. The HR and my manager (who's otherwise a pretty decent fellow) are beating around the bush without giving me clear answers. And there's rumors that there's no relocation budget left.
I very strongly want to start looking for other jobs. But I find myself looking at ads with almost the same job description as my current job and I feel like I wouldn't be able to justify why I want to move without ratting out my employer. 
Should I stick around for longer? Or should I start looking and be honest during interviews?

TLDR- Is remote to non-remote movement an acceptable reason to look for a job change when you've just started a new remote job (which wasn't disclosed to be remote at the time of hiring) ?"
"I’m not sure whether this is the right place to post, but I’m looking for some career advice. (21M), I’m in a hellish construction job and want to become an independent scuba diver. Can anyone help?","I’m 21, living in England, I have been out of education for 3 years now with no A-levels (long depressing story) I’m very money driven although it’s not the be all and end all. My passion is scuba diving and I love the ocean environment. I also would like to make a series documentaries around diving, similar to BBC’s blue planet but more Centers around diving.

What I’m doing now and what I don’t like about it: I’m currently working for my dad in construction, I’m a labourer on £8.50 per hour, terrible money for the graft imo, it’s very tedious and I hate manual labour. I really hate the people I work with too, except for a minute few, they’re vulgar and extremely close-minded people. It’s a stressful and frustrating environment.

Now I’m not going to sugarcoat the fact that I was a spoiled kid, which I’m not blaming anyone for, my parents had a poor upbringing and didn’t want they’re children to experience the same lifestyle. So, it’s bittersweet, it definitely hasn’t helped me acclimatise to the “real world”.

I’m blabbing now but essentially I just want to earn a nice income, be independent and work with my passion. 

I’ve looked into marine biology and commercial diving, none quite fit the picture. Can anyone give me some advice on how to move forward?
It’s been 3 years and I’m in the same place as I was when I was in school. Thanks Reddit.

Tl;dr - I want a job in scuba diving, that pays well and I’m self employed (ideally). I can’t stand construction anymore.

Requested edit: I also have advanced and rescue scuba qualifications along with multiple specialities including dry suit, videography and nitrox gas. Definitely willing to do more training."
40 years old and I keep changing my mind about what I want to do. What do you do in that case?,"My problem is not how but what:  what do I want to be?  I'm now 40 years old and I don't have a career in any single field.  I have multiple degrees in film and media.  I love stories and I love making people laugh.  I've worked in the film industry (couldn't stand it because my personality doesn't fit the ego and status driven culture), a small business in trading (I liked the autonomy but had no passion for selling merchandise), teaching (love working with children and I'm great at it but it gets exhausting), government (struggled with the bureaucracy but enjoyed the easy pace), animation production (being a small cog in a giant system made me depressed).  

I'm smart and hard-working so I generally succeed in whatever I do.  But I find that I always get tired of a job after a year or two and move on to something different.  I recently quit my animation job and thought that I wanted to pursue stand-up comedy professionally.  I do have a knack for it: performing, writing and comedy.  But after a few months of performing as an amateur, I now think this is something I'd like to pursue as a hobby and not an occupation.  

I recently took a Jackson Vocational Interest Survey and my top 3 interests are 1. social science, 2. professional advising and 3. performing arts.  

I'm now thinking that I'd like to work for a non-profit that helps youths.  I've always found it fulfilling to help youths to develop themselves and achieve their goals (mainly because this is what I wish I had when I was younger.) I'm hoping that if I pursue this line of work for income and pursue stand-up as a hobby that I'll be fulfilled spiritually, financially and creatively.  But I'm scared that even this I'll get tired of after a year or two and end up where I am now.

Are there other people like me?  Is my problem that I just haven't found a line of work that works for me - the assumption being that there is a ""right fit"" for everyone?  Or are there personalities that just gets bored easily and needs change every few years?  If so, what is the best way to deal with this type of problem?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you."
Boss is asking me for a copy of a trespass order?,"Hi,  


My boss is very invasive and is constantly pushing and prying into my personal life. It's just a low-end retail job. She was 'requiring' me to publicly post my name and photo on the company's website. For my own safety, I refused. I have a stalker and take my privacy and anonymity seriously.

I saw a memo about my upcoming termination. What should I do now?,"I was called into a unexpected meeting with my new president and HR. Issues raised during the meeting included concerns that I was unhappy with the company, my negative attitude, and poor performance. Specifics wouldn't be shared with me. 

While I have been indeed unhappy with the new leadership, I've never let it show or affect my performance. I suspect it's the new president's paranoia that put me under his radar. He has had problems with staff in the past. 

I brought up the meeting with my other managers. They were shocked at the news and told me that they didn't think a fair assessment was done. I've been going exceeding expectations as far as they are aware. There's also not much they can do. While speaking with them I saw a memo on their computers that if changes in performance weren't made in the next 3 business days, I would be let go. Not a lot of time for remediation. 

I'm unsure how to proceed. I am a top performer and have been taking up responsibilities that no one else can to ensure success of the company. 
While I still have assess to their systems, what data should I back up? How can I prepare for a wrongful termination?

Lawyers: Do you guys like your job? Should I do it?,"I’m about to graduate from college with a degree in communications and philosophy and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I’m just filled with anxiety.

I’ve got an Asian tiger mom pushing me to go into the direction of law because she thinks I’ll not only be good at it, but it’s a reputable and stable career. On the other hand, I’ve got a White cowboy dad who wants me to work in the family businesses he built. They totally hate each other. 

Now I don’t know if any of this is true, but my dad told me that I wouldn’t make enough to support myself comfortably as a lawyer. It’s not guaranteed a high paying job, where as the family business would. Not to mention, the cost of law school. I know this is wrong, but I don’t want to disappoint my mom either. She’s done everything for me and provided me with everything. 

So now I’m thinking law school would be a great educational venture, but idk if I want to be a lawyer. 
Every lawyer I’ve met has said “how can I talk you out of it?”

My dad got fired from the only job he's ever had after our family moved across the country. How can I help him get back on his feet with no degree?,"My dad is 48 and the father of 6 children (two are pretty financially independent and out of school, while my sister and I are in college back in our previous state and have had to borrow money a few times...). He doesn't have a degree, though he recalls almost completing an associate's through CC in the early 90s.

Over the summer, my parents moved to Salt Lake City to be closer to family. They moved into my grandparents' basement until they found a house. In September, he lost the only proper job he has had. In this I.T./business process outsourcing company, he's had a few different titles- though he refers to himself as a Business Analyst.

He's one of the most intelligent creative, hard working and charismatic people I know, but he has ADHD and can seem a little unmotivated at times. My Mom picked up a job as a pharmacy technician at CVS- I came home for the holidays hoping my dad might have leads or interviews, but the most that's happened is meeting with a representative from the LDS career center once or twice a week (my family is Mormon). He recently looked at taking some courses through their ""pathway"" program, which helps set you up towards a degree with a partnering school- I'm not sure if he will end up doing it.

I haven't looked at his resume. I don't know much about the job market for people with his background, but with 22 years of experience, he knows at least the ins and outs of data management and his way around a computer- I'm sure he's qualified to handle more.

I woke up, eat breakfast, and study chemistry. Then I go to classes and study chemistry between classes. (I eat lunch while studying.) After that, I eat dinner and go to bed. Rinse and repeat.

When I said ""study"", I mean 80% reading (textbook, online papers from the professors, etc.) and 20% doing homework, lab report, etc.

Reading is just so time and energy consuming. I have to spend so much effort making sure that I am reading the right words that I often get ""lost"" in the text and forget what the text was saying.

I wasn't just my chemistry major classes that I was struggling with. I struggled with the general elective classes (literature, ethnic study, etc.)

My advisers sent me to skill classes (note taking classes, time management classes, etc) and they didn't help.

Finally, in my last term, I talked with my professor in a class I was struggling with.

I describe extensively how hard I try and how much time I spend studying. What he said changed my life.

He said that I probably have dyslexia and that his son has that.

I changed the way I study. I stopped retyping my notes after class, and instead, record lectures for later listening. Instead of reading texts, I use text to speech software to listen to text.

I initially thought that I would surely fail that class. I, instead, ended up with a B+.

In another class, I earned my first ever A+ in college.

Furthermore, with the change in the way I study, I feel that I didn't have to work as hard to earn a good grade. I was able to retain the material more easily and naturally.

It's a shame that I didn't figured this out earlier. (When I was using the more traditional methods taught in skill classes, I did poorly).

My undergraduate studies are over and I feel that my grades are not reflective of my abilities.

I want to show graduate schools that I deserved to be in their programs, but they will surely scoff at my GPA.

Obviously, I can't have a do-over, so what can I do?"
Have anyone given up the idea of 'career' and just hop jobs to jobs as long as it pays bills?,"It seems nowadays, there is no jobs or career ladder that would last forever. So somewhere in the mid 40s we still have to face mid-life crisis. It looks like hoping from job to job, industry to industry to pay bills in the way to go."
"HR people of reddit, when hundreds of people apply, how do you decide who to call or interview?","Basically looking at indeed, and they tell you how many people have already applied, and the numbers are very often over fifty!

Anybody feel scared that time invested in learning something new won't pay off?,"I'm 23, currently on minimum wage and I've been stuck in this period of mentally going from job to job not being able to get anywhere or commit to anything. I got a good degree in Visual Communication but i've yet to be able to do anything with it. I finished uni and got a job which I've been at for around 7 months now. I thought web dev - amongst other things - would be my thing, but could never commit.

Now, I think I've found that UI/UX design could be on the right track, since I have some design experience and my degree is related. To be honest, I'm worried that this won't work out, that I'll either change my mind or spend all this time learning new skills which won't pay off. That I won't be able to get a decent job in the field and I'll be back at square one learning something new again. I'm trying to get myself into a decent career to get my life moving.

Is it possible to achieve the big three?,"By big three I mean: work-life balance, good pay and benefits, and job satisfaction? Does anyone in this sub have it?"
Why is employer branding so fake?,"I have 10+ years of work experience and was asked more than 3 times to be put on camera or have a picture of me posted on the company website and a text how awesome the company is. Deep down I knew that it was so much fake, but the request came from the senior management and who wants to sabotages his/her career?
They (big pharmaceutical company) claimed that they are family friendly or promote work-life balance, while I was not even allowed to do home office regularly with my office job.

What are signs that you're NOT going to get fired?,"Yes, you read the title correctly.

I seem to get fired pretty easily (due to a variety of learning challenges...not anything related to violations or disrespect). I am getting counseling for these challenges, but my question still remains.

Even at my current job when I'm constantly asking for feedback on my job performance, I'm still waking up every day hoping I don't get fired, and breathing a sigh of relief at the end of the day when I still have my job.

**So what are signs that I'm ""safe"" at work?** At what point can I hit autopilot and just do my job without having to be 100% vigilant?

"Entry-level job asking for 5+ professional references that I don't have, what should I do?","I recently interviewed for a Medical Office Associate job (the person who checks you in and out when you go to a doctor's office) at a local hospital and the next day I received a generic email from HR via Checkster asking for 5+ professional references (supervisors or peers, no family or friend's) as part of the hiring process. I clicked on the link and it said that I had been short-listed for the position and they needed to do a reference check as the next step and gave me 2 days to complete it. 

This step in the process wasn't mentioned in the application or the interview, so I was not prepared for it at all. I am not in contact with previous supervisors or coworkers, nor did my previous positions involve any sort of email correspondence, so I wouldn't be able to provide an email address if I had the references. 

I'm kind of at a loss for what to do now. Life had been a little rough up until recently where I was homeless and living out of my car for a month. I'm trying to get back on my feet and this job would be an amazing opportunity for me. The work/education history I provided on my resume is accurate; I just don't have a personal relationship with any previous co-workers/supervisors where I could hit them up and ask them to complete a reference check. Any advice on how to move forward? "
"Hiring managers and HR pros, how do you make salary, raise, and promotion decisions? What should I enforce as a manage and what should I expect as an employee?","Hey all, let's talk salary. I have a few questions about how different companies set salaries and give raises and promotions. I'm keeping this as brief as possible, but am happy to add more color if needed.

1) Hiring Managers: how would you characterize your salary setting philosophy? Meaning, how much weight to you place on a new hire's individual skills & strengths vs their ""paper"" resume (their degree, their industry experience etc). Also, does this change when related to internal candidates where the candidate may have a great track record within the company and very concrete proven skills demonstrated during their employment thus far, but a weaker paper resume and less industry experience? 

2) Salary increases: I'll give an example here. I had two hires for the same position. I hired one in at a higher salary rate due to prior experience and a very strong resume, but the 2nd (more entry level in the industry, originally hired at a lower rate) is fantastic and quickly outpaced the more experienced hire.  Over 1+ year this employee has proven to be more productive, self driven and innovative, and has also taken on a bigger workload. I want to increase this 2nd hire's salary to be more comparable to the more experienced employee, but am getting pushback because this more entry level employee still technically has less experience. Is this normal? Or, as the hiring manager for this position, should I be pushing harder for a raise for this employee? Assume budget isn't a limiting factor here. 

3) Internal Promotions: I've seen my current company manage internal promotions in two different ways,  and I'm curious which is more common practice (or if both are used commonly, or something else)

Lets say a current employee proves their skills & worth and is clearly ready for a promotion. There is a larger role needed,  and the employee is a good fit for growth. Assume budget isn't the issue here, just employee development. Do you....

A) Offer the employee the additional responsibilities and a title change, as well as a salary bump.

B) Give the employee the additional responsibilities. If they do well, offer them the title change and salary bump after they prove they can do the new job. 

C) Another option? Post the new job and do a formal hiring process? Anything else? 

Tldr: paper resume or proven skills, which has more impact on an employee's salary? "
What do I do if my boss offers me a new position with no raise but says that I'd be forced to resign if I refuse?,"Backstory:

I've been with this non profit organization for the last 2 years. I started as an Office Assistant but took on more duties that involved help in the administrative team. My duties evolved to the point that they decided to create a new title for me: Operations Specialist. This involves, IT support, systems management, Contact Resource Management, training new-hires, new hire paperwork, creating flyers and promotional materials for events, direct supervision of office assistant, compiling and reporting on data to our funders and contractors etc.

Today:

I was told this morning that they are going to move our current Office Manager to a different position and have me absorb her duties and her title. This means that, in addition to (most of) my current duties, I will be doing payroll, assisting in human resources, accounts payable, direct support for management, overseeing office supply inventory, answering all incoming phone calls, overseeing our incoming and outgoing mail, responding to our info@ emails, and be the contact person for all office staff for sick days and time off requests.

I asked what the new pay was going to be. I was told that I am already in the middle range of the new position so she wouldn't consider a pay raise discussion until 3 months. I asked if she would be flexible on that at all and was told that it's not in the budget at the moment and, because I will have to learn quickbooks, I don't have all of the job skills required yet anyway.

I asked what would happen if I decide the new position is not for me. I was told "" If you decided that it wasn't for you then I guess you are resigning.  We don't have any other positions open. ""

I have two questions: Can I get unemployment if I don't want the job? Have they done something wrong to me? I can't really figure it out. All I know is that I feel really hurt and don't feel like working here any more but can't seem to work out what specifically is making me feel that way. Any perspective you can provide would be most welcome. Thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit:

Also, is it considered a resignation if I'm being forced to quit because I feel unqualified and unable to absorb another person's 30 hour work week into my 40 hour a week job?"
"They think I am an Architect, what should I do?","Hi guys I've worked for this small architecture and engineering firm for about two years. When I sent my resume for a drafter position I was very clear I had completed x credits in the architecture program in my home country, never said I had graduated. However, all my coworkers think I am an architect. I am doing very good here, I started with a low salary but now I make more money than all of them that are actual architects. I didn't do anything wrong, I never lied about it, they got it wrong for some reason. However, I did have the opportunity to correct them last time a new employee was being introduced to us and they said ""everyone in this row are architects"", but I didn't say anything. What should I do?

ps: by ""architect"" I mean bachelor in Architecture, not a licensed Architect.

**UPDATE**: Probably I wasn't clear enough or I shouldn't have used the term ""architect"". Here in the office, we all know that there is only one person who is the licensed architect. He is the one signing and stamping all architectural projects.

However, it's a common practice when introducing someone to call them ""architect"" or ""engineer"" even though they are not licensed. When referring to the licensed professional, we say ""he is the licensed architect"". I know this is technically wrong, but this is not the point here.

The point is that they think I am a bachelor in Architecture but I am not and now after two years I feel very uncomfortable having to explain them I didn't finish architectural school."
Lost 39 year old looking for career advice (having never participated in the job market)?,"Hello,

I am at a crossroads in my life and feel pretty lost and deflated. I know nothing about starting a career and finding a job and I while I work myself into the matter, I am looking to you guys to maybe lend a helping hand.

I am a 39 year old lawyer living in Berlin, Germany. After graduating I worked as a self-employed lawyer for 2 years, realized I hated it and became a daytrader (for the last 2-3 years) hoping to achieve financial independence - this did not work out. I am now looking for a job to make a living and to be able to support my girlfriend and newborn son.

My days of self-actualization are over, pragmatism is the name of the game for me and I am willing to accept any sustainable compromise that brings in a paycheck.

Any insight from people familiar with the german job market will probably the most valuable, but I am sure some stuff is relatable across borders.

Problem is: I have no work experience and I am really old and my academical achievements are bad (bottom 10% bad).

A bit about myself and my interests: 

I studied philosophy, psychology and politics before swithching to law. This is where my interests mainly lie. Geostrategical stuff being the most applicable probably.

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

Mods may move this as is applicable; I posted this in all relevant subreddits I could find."
Is Computer Science or Engineering worth getting into at 28?,"I never went to college and I just got my high school equivalency. I'm not stupid, just made childish, fear based decisions in my early 20s and have been fighting hard against them ever since. I went from making minimum wage to 35k a year in less than a year, so I'm proud of how far I've come. People are starting to recognize my ability to learn and that feels good.

That being said, the job I'm at now cannot be forever. It's within the tourism industry which is not a stable or recession resistant industry. I also know (and this has taken a lot of work to come to this conclusion) I am able of mind for much more difficult and high paying work in speciality fields.

However, by the time I finish a degree I would be at least 32. That's optimistic. I would be in debt and be 10 years behind my cohorts. I know I'll never have as successful a life as others, but what can I do to use what gifts I do have to capitalize on the time I do have? Are computer science/engineering degrees worth it later in life? Are there similar career paths that require less education? Right now, I plan to start classes in the fall at a community college working on required classes and mathematics. Beyond that, I don't know."
Is there a career/side gig someone can take 1-2 years to learn (formally or otherwise) and then do outside of a 9-5 job?,"I’m interested to know if there’s something I can commit myself to learning over the next year or two that I can begin doing in addition to my full-time job. Clearly not looking for a quick buck, which is why I’m wondering what can be learned in under two years. Anyone do anything like this?

Thanks in advance!"
Best ways to improve public speaking/reduce social anxiety before beginning a job?,"I'm a very type B person. I think my interpersonal skills when one on one or in a small group are ok, but I am deathly terrified of public speaking, or even speaking up in a medium sized meeting. Anytime I have to give a presentation, introduce myself publicly in front of a large group of people, or something similar, my heart begins to race and I have a panic attack where I'm short of breath and my voice is shaky. It's embarrassing because I don't have any mental anxiety about these situations, but its entirely physical and I have no control over it. It's like muscle memory.

&#x200B;

I have had a prescription for beta blockers which have been an absolute miracle and basically gotten rid of any anxiety symptoms when in these situations. I will still use them during major presentations, but I don't want to feel reliant on them, and would prefer to go through some sort or training that can rewire my brain into not becoming stressed in these situations. I'm about to graduate college and begin a great job in a major city in which I will often have to give presentations to clients, and I will be surrounded by a lot of type A corporate individuals. 

&#x200B;

At this point it's absolutely essential that I get over this and am able to assimilate into my new job seamlessly. Would joining a Toastmasters club or Dale Carnegie help? I figure that practice is what will help me get over it, by teaching my brain to become less stressed in these situations. Unfortunately, I am unable to take a public speaking course at my university. I checked a local community college, but was confused if I was able to enroll not being a student, and if what I found was even a legitimate course. I believe this form of social anxiety I have is probably my biggest weakness and a major barrier that once its overcome, will allow me to thrive professionally.

&#x200B;

Any advice, tips, or similar experiences that can be shared would be appreciated. I begin my new job this summer, and I feel like the longer I go without fixing this, the harder it will be to do so."
"I love paperwork. Like, I love it so much. What careers include Organization tasks, research, and just generally admin stuff?","Hey guys, 

Recently, while working in a temp job, I realised how much I love immersing myself in a specific admin/paperwork task. If you give me thousands of pieces of paper and tell me to sort through them, organise them into a binder, colour code, and find a specific piece of information in a minute, then you make heaven come to earth for me. 

I am studying Law currently (UK), and I want to finish my degree. I love my degree, but I’m not sure that becoming a solicitor would be for me. I speak languages, and I am very interested in education, social fields like social work, and again, I bloody love paperwork. I am also very social, I am great at talking and debating, and I like to help people with what I do. Research is also one of my strong suits, both in physical versions of data and on the internet.

Why am I expected to sit and do nothing all day?,"I'm on my 3rd corporate job and I make a lot of money as a statistical programmer in finance. I have about $100k in student loans that I am already aggressively paying down, but getting to a net worth of $0 is going to take about 3 years. 

In every job I've had (1 consulting, 2 finance), I probably have 1-2 hours of real work to do each day but I am expected to keep the chair warm from 9 to 6. My team doesn't work in the same city as me, so I don't really understand why I need to be in the office. I've tried to create my own projects in every job, but (1) we are a regulatory function and there isn't much to add; and (2) I'm there to complete work that needs done, not dream up time-wasting projects to look busy with. 

The people in my office are on other teams so we don't have anything to talk about. They are also in very different life stages than me. We say hi but that's about it.

The usual advice in this situation seems to be ""use that free time to study for your next job."" Well I have been studying for the past 3 years post-grad, and that's exactly how I got this job. It's just going to get me into a different variant of this situation. Let me know which jobs don't require 9-6 desk sitting for statistical modelers and I'll definitely start studying.

I don't want to sit at a desk doing nothing all day. It's pointless, unhealthy, and rather lonely. My reviews are positive as when there is work, I do it quickly and with good quality. There just isn't enough work. 

This results in me trying to look busy all day when I'm really staring into space. I don't want another job in my field because they are all the like this (I'm on my 3rd one now) and I don't want to switch fields because I'd likely end up in the same situation for a lot less pay. 

**I want to work but there doesn't seem to be any worthwhile work to be done.** I am a bored, soulless desk sitter waiting for 6. 

EDIT: I can't work remotely. It is discouraged on my team and in my field. Ironic, because we are geographically dispersed, so we are all technically remote, we just have to sit in the office and listen to that guy Steve's fucking theories about who's making it to the playoffs and his cell phone arguments with his wife.

What jobs could you guys recommend that actually do something good for people?,"I've wanted to be a detective for a while now and met with a Sheriff recently to find out that most cases no matter the amount of evidence people still get away with it or continue doing it.

I want to wake up every morning and know I'm doing right by this world but I'm starting to lose hope, yes I know I'm young and ignorant. My therapist told me to become an insurance inspector because I'll be solving cases like a detective and I'm maybe thinking about that because I really like that side of what being a cop would be, but I don't know how happy I'd be because I'm not directly helping others all that much. I'm also thinking maybe just find a job that fucks off from the world and makes decent money nothing bad, yet not really doing anything inherently good directly I guess because I don't want to die yet I feel like this world is nothing but scams and bullshit and the idea of really helping is something we can never accomplish. Also I have a GED and live in Georgia (can't move) so I have to put that into consideration.  Sorry if this is a lot I'm very lost if you can't tell lol."
Why are so many people against choosing a career(lucrative degree) mostly for the pay?,"Like I get the whole ""do something you love"" deal but honestly, the ONLY jobs on this planet that I would even remotely think of as a ""dream job"" either pay jack or just aren't at all realistic. I'm 21 years old, I had stopped going to school when I was 19 and worked full time retail(Home Depot) for a year and a half to decide what I want with my life before making any rash decisions in my degree choice. I quit recently and decided to get my ass back to school ASAP because nothing pushes/motivates you towards higher education than a POS job amirite lol. Decided to change my major from art(which I honestly have a big passion for) to something that's actually gonna help me retire as young as possible so I can still hopefully pursue art young but instead with my bank account being obese this time around. Now it's really just a game of which high paying career route to go with. But upon telling this to my friends they hit me with the ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!"" or ""IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PASSION FOR THE JOB DON'T GO FOR IT"" and also ""I'D RATHER WORK A JOB I LOVE AND GET PAYED JACK THAN DO SOMETHING I HATE THAT PAYS WELL"". But unlike them, i'm not a fan of paying an arm and leg to go to college just to come out with a 30K-40K a year salary. But apparently a lot of people feel the way they do. So just wanna know if it's REALLY that big of a deal to pick a lucrative career for the money. (of course not something that'll obviously kill you like underwater welding)"
My company is cutting salaries by 20%...but I can’t afford the pay cut. Is there a way to negotiate this diplomatically?,"I am a sr. associate level employee working for a small-ish company. A few weeks ago, it was mentioned that executives and director-level employees may be forced to take a pay cut to keep the company afloat. However, today it was announced that all employees will see a 20% pay cut starting in a few weeks.

I am currently one of the lowest paid employees in the company and absolutely will not be able to afford the cost of living in my area if my salary is reduced by 20%. I met with my boss to ask whether the exec team could consider a lower percentage cut (like 10 or 15%) for employees making below a certain salary/seniority level. The company is small, so there are only a handful of associate level employees to whom this exception would apply. He was pretty negative towards the idea saying that it’s “tough for everyone right now” and that it’s “only fair” for everyone to make the same sacrifice.

But the thing is... we’re not really all making the same sacrifice. While I am grateful to have a job during this situation, a 20% cut for my boss and other senior level employees is probably a “sacrifice.” On the other hand, a 20% reduction for those of us at the bottom is a make or break difference. Honestly, when the office reopens, Im not even sure if I’d be able to afford the cost of my commute anymore on this reduced salary. It would almost have been better to be laid off or furloughed because currently, unemployment pays more than my reduced salary, plus, I’d be eligible for other benefits, like food stamps and subsidized rent. At the very least, offering a reduction in hours along side the salary decrease would allow me the ability to take on a second job (if I can find one...)

My boss told me I could bring it up with HR, but that they “most likely won’t be receptive.” I understand that things are tough and I am willing to sacrifice in order to keep my job (such as giving up other benefits like the paid leave I’ve acquired) ... but I need to at least try to negotiate a better situation because, quite frankly, I can’t afford not to.

Is there a way for me to go about this diplomatically?"
Where can I find 100% remote W-2 employment?,"Due to a sudden unexpected situation, I need a work-at-home position. I am aware of the various crowdsourcing sites and fee-for-service opportunities like online teaching, but I need W-2 employment. I don't need to make a large salary. I'm old though, and I don't even know what sorts of companies do this or where to start. Google searches of remote work of course bring up mostly crowdsourcing sites or scammy things. If it's helpful, I have a master's degree in a healthcare field and one in an education field, along with decades of work experience that involves decision-making skills, writing, editing, etc. I would work in pretty much any field that would hire me. Anyone have any suggestions?"
When should I start applying to jobs in a city I want to move to?,"I’m planning on moving to a new city in August. How soon can I start applying to jobs?

Since this will be a change for me I’m wondering if I should start looking sooner rather than later? 

Also, I am moving out of my current city because it’s not where I want to be settled down to start a family. How do I prove to a prospective employer that I want to stay in their city? I know my current company likes to know that people they are hiring will be staying around for the foreseeable future, so I’m worried a question about this will come up. 

Any and all advice is much appreciated!!"
I’m up for a promotion against 2 others. How do I set myself apart?,"I work at a small local pizza/catering chain in the Cleveland area. Our GM (who is part owner with his parents) is looking for someone to replace himself so he can step up to the Owner position so his parents can retire. The position was offered to me and 2 ladies. They’re both in their 40’s and have worked there for 10+ years. I’m 24 and have worked there for 3 years. I also have a culinary degree. 

How do I set myself apart from them to show I’ll excel? I already am a shift manager and run the store solo all the time. Same with the 2 ladies. We are literally all comparable when it comes to skill sets and management quality. The one lady may have a slight up as she does our scheduling. 

Any tips reddit? I wanna show them I can make the place better than it already is."
32M with 9 years of failed equity/startup exp - am I unemployable?,"I have 6 years of work experience before graduating college, plus another 9 years of experience since. However, my post-college experience has all been in tech startups, whether as a Cofounder or early employee. Each startup was funded in Silicon Valley with varying degrees of success, but I've never made more than $48k/year in 'salary' from any of those companies preferring equity.

I've recently gotten married, putting a stop to my bootstrapping lifestyle in pursuit of something more comfortable for my wife. I'm from Silicon Valley and have friends here making $100k+ with 3-4 years of experience doing one thing well vs being a generalist like me.

Job titles and their descriptions confuse me - I relate most to project management, but don't think my experience is similar to ones in larger tech companies with 100m+ customers. I've collectively managed maybe 10m.

Am I screwed? Should I expect to take a pay cut/less senior position to prove my loyalty in the workforce? Many have told me I come across as an opportunist whom a larger employer won't want to invest in...."
What is a day as a market research analyst like?,I am looking into applying for a position as a market research analyst.  I would like to work in a analytical field but also have some autonomy and creativity involved.  My biggest concern is I cannot do too much customer service type work.  Is this something I might enjoy? What is a typical day like?  How much time is spent on the phone?
I’m worried about working 50 Hours/Week and going to Grad School. Has anyone experienced something similar and can give me tips on how to get through it?,"I just got a great new job that starts in three weeks that pays really well. The problem is that they told me it would be a 50 hour/week job and I’m also taking two classes in Grad School. I’m worried about how I’m going to survive the stress of the extra workload of my new job along with the intensity of my coursework. 
Can someone give me some guidance of how they got through their similar experience, or just some tips on how to balance everything?"
I want to escape my desk job and find something meaningful. Any suggestions?," 

I am 25 and have been working as a digital designer for 3 years in advertising and design firms. I am looking for a complete career change but don’t know where to begin. I'm feeling pretty lost and getting anxious and overwhelmed.

In my 3 years working as a designer I have grown to find the work unrewarding, meaningless, and not stimulating. Gradually my dissatisfaction with my career has lead me into an existential crisis and depression.

I have decided that I no longer want a desk/ office job that requires you to work on the computer majority of the day as I find it is not stimulating for me. I hate sitting in the same office behind a screen every day.

I want to find a non-desk job that is meaningful and rewarding. Something that I can be passionate about and feel good for contributing to the greater good of the world. Something that has good career trajectory - good potential to progress in my career and earn more as I get older. I would love to be working outdoors some of the time or at least moving around, not sitting at a desk.

I am particularly interested in the idea of doing environmental work of some sort - maybe forestry or wildlife conservation. I would also consider humanitarian or even social work.

I have a Bachelor of Design and would be willing to do further studies for up to 2 years to make me qualified for my dream job, whatever it may be.

The hard part is that I have not done maths or science further than junior high school so I can’t get into a Masters Degree that has prerequisites of maths and science.

I have considered carpentry and other trades, but I think I want to find something more meaningful that is having a positive impact rather than just just building houses or commercial buildings. Although, I think I would like to be working with my hands or doing technical work of some sort.

I have also considered fireman and paramedic jobs but I don’t think I would cope well with the stress and traumatic situations they have to deal with.

I have been looking for quite a while at possible career options or further studies but I am really stumped for answers. 

I struggle with anxiety and I am getting quite overwhelmed when searching and not seeming to make much progress so that is why thought I would try posting here to see what suggestions people have.

Does anyone out there have any ideas of cool jobs that I could look into or further studies that I could do to help me in the right direction?

Or has anyone gone through a similar experience with wanting a complete career change, to ditch their desk job and find something more fulfilling?

&#x200B;

If you have any suggestions at all, please throw them down. I just want to get as many ideas as possible.  


Thanks :)"
"I frequently read from people on Reddit who earn $150k+ salaries. As a 35 year old, is it too late for me to get into one of those fields?","If my interests are wide open, is it possible?"
"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?","I work for a large engineering firm in the UK.

The company has a culture whereby effective, valuable and worthy candidates for promotion can spend months - or even years - operating at the level of the grade above, but simultaneously being denied a promotion.

The usual outcome to this is that the employee in question gets fed up and either moves role internally or leaves the business, after which the company invariably re-advertises their position **at the higher grade anyway**.

I have been with the company for 8 years now and have seen this happen time and time and time again. 

The obvious explanation is that the personnel asking for promotion are effectively ""dead wood"", and the managers are happy to see the back of them, or that they feel it is an opportunity to bring in outside talent. However, this is not the case. The ones being pushed to leave are often the hardest working and most ambitious, and usually have very niche and specialised knowledge/experience. The ""dead wood"", by comparison, seem to know they are on to a good thing and try not to rock the boat.

Is this common practice in other businesses? What is the justification behind this kind of approach to personnel management?"
How to transition out of a higher ed career?,"Hey all - a little background here: I've been working higher education since shortly after I graduated from college in December 2014. I started out in January 2015 as an administrative assistant for the Student Services dept at a university, and then in August 2017, I received a reclassification in the same dept to student programs advisor. My pay went up 7% with this change. This reclassification came about because my initial work duties went from basic scheduling of meetings, minimal event planning, and handling of communication (emails, phone calls) to extensive data reports for departments, meetings with student organizations regarding university events and adherence to policies, and supervision of a student computer lab and team of student workers. I received my Master in Education in May 2019 while working full time because my university offered a tuition benefit.

However, I have come to realize in the five years I've been working at this university that I prefer the administrative angle of my job much more than the student focused portion of my job (direct advising). I enjoy tracking data, creating data reports, coordinating meetings/events (working with vendors, monitoring budgets, serving as the point of contact, etc), streamlining processes (a lot of things went from paper to digital as a result of changes I made), and just generally I enjoy being someone who pulls the strings behind the scenes vs someone who meets with students daily. Also, I've come to realize how severely underpaid I am given my experience and credentials-I live in a big city and it's very hard getting by on my current salary. My current job is unable to offer me a raise despite my master's degree so I am looking to move on very soon.

I would like to make the jump into something strictly administrative such as executive assistant, office coordinator, office manager, etc and I am looking outside the university setting. I have a lot of friends in office jobs that are being paid more than I am (with less work experience and no master's); I'm in my mid-20s and I want to make this career change now.

Does anyone here have any experience making a similar career jump from higher ed into another industry? Does anyone have advice for how to convert my higher ed resume into something more administrative sounding? Thanks so much!"
What can a recently moderately crippled person realistically do for work?,"I'm a 27 year old male who recently went through some health issues the past year and a half. I never got sick never had as much as a broken bone. Was completely healthy, lifting, running, skateboarding, and playing basketball 4 to 6 times a week with a moderately physical job. Over the course of one weekend a year and a half ago I started to become weaker and weaker from Friday to Sunday . Friday being the last time I could do all those things I listed before and Sunday to complete paralysis. After going to the emergency room, it was determined that I had Guillian-Barre syndrome. Guillian-Barre is the peripheral nerve equivalent to multiple sclerosis. However the only positive thing about Guillian Barre is that it is a self limiting syndrome and I will eventually get most innervation of the nerves back, as the peripheral nervous system does have the ability to regenerate itself unlike the central nervous system. Being completely paralyzed, everyone was doing everything for me. I could not feed myself, bathe myself, dress myself, let alone sit up in a chair for more than 10 minutes without needing to lay back down. It affected my eyes too where I was seeing double for about 3 to 4 months. Luckily most of the stuff has resolved itself. I am able to dress , bathe, feed/cook for myself and family now as well as most other occupational things. The hardest part now is getting the rest back. With Guillian-Barre, the symptoms start distally and end proximally upon contraction of the acute phase of the disease. When reinnervation occurs, it does so in the opposite fashion. So now everything on me distally is very weak. (Hands, forearms, calves, feet). I can walk but only short distances because my upper legs are working very hard to compensate what my lower legs are not able to do. Even typing, as I type this right now I have to switch back and forth with voice dictation and typing as my hands get very fatigued. Another thing to know about this disease is that there are different variants with varying degrees of severity. Instead of getting the normal Guillian-Barre which is prominent in North America and still a 1 in 100,000 chance and has the best recovery outcome, I got the variant that is prominent in Asian countries which has the worst recovery outcome. I have never left the East Coast of the United States which still baffles me today. I am also fairly tall as well 6 foot 3 inches so if you think about it the taller you are the longer your nerves the longer the recovery. Nerves recover at a rate of 1-5mm/ day which is like 1-4in/month so if im 75 inches from had to toe then… well you can do the math.

With all that being said, I am posting this in this subreddit today because I really need a job. When you're a single white male with no children there is virtually no help at all that you can get from government aids. The only thing I am surviving on now is the little bit of savings that I built up while I was working and Social Security disability which is not enough to survive on. However, I'm at a loss with what I can do. I really don’t think I could keep up with a 9 to 5 job going in every day with the fatigue factor of this disease. So I would really like to work from home. When exploring jobs at home most of them are on the Phone which require you to be able to type as well. As I mentioned before I have to switch back and forth between voice dictation and typing as again the fatigue of typing tires my hands. If I am on the Phone with someone I will not be able to use voice dictation.

I'm kind of at a loss for where else to look and honestly the great people on reddit have given me advice and information in the past on other things that were useful. Also, if I am not in the right subreddit maybe someone could point me in to one that would be better suited for this question."
What can I do with my psychology degree?,"Hi all. 

I am a 23 year old about to graduate with my bachelors degree in psychology this December. I am posting here today because I am lost on what doors this degree opens for me. I went into college almost straight out of high school with no idea what I wanted to do. I went because that’s what I was expected to do. I told myself I’d figure out a career later. My entire time in college, I have also worked part-time jobs, ranging from food service to my current retail gig. Working and my full class schedule took up most of my time, and so I never explored my interests beyond the courses required for my degree. I did not volunteer or join clubs, I worked and got good grades. 

I have spent time looking for full time jobs I could get with my degree, and the ones that pay what I need to support myself all want experience of some sort. Currently, my parents are pressuring me to apply to law school and go from there. I’m not 100% sold on the idea of being a lawyer. I guess I’m just looking for advice on routes I can take with just a bachelors degree and customer service experience. 

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this"
Jobs that let you be active/be in nature? Would it help my depression?,"I burned out on teaching and am battling really bad depression atm. I’m looking to start working again soon, something part time. I think moving around or being in nature would really help me, as I have a lot of trouble just getting up and going for a walk and gyms make me anxious. If I could get outside or move around as a job, it may help. Not just standing around, like retail or teaching - I’ve been on my feet all day in those jobs and I hurt at the end of the day. 


However, I have no experience with these types of jobs... idk what to do. I want try something different while I work on my health, I think it would be beneficial.

Do online courses matter when applying to a job?,"Hi, i just graduated this year with a GPA of 3.2 (chemistry major), i've been trying to find any courses that would make my CV better such as ""lean six sigma"" but it's kinda expensive for me as i don't have a constant income yet (costs around 2k), so i turned to online courses and i'm okay with just gaining the knowledge i need from these courses but I'm curious if employers would actually take them seriously."

I worked as a beginning machinist while in high school, but decided to pursue a medical job in the military.

I didn't pass probation for my dream job. How should i reflect on this?,"Hi all,

I didn't pass probation. It was an economist position. I'm new to the workforce, been working since graduation for ~11 months.

I feel some of it was my fault, but some of it was not. I did my best, and thought i was doing well. I could do things that others there couldn't do. I met deadlines (where they were given to me). I learnt R on the job, and in a month i could write complex geospatial analyses in R to help with evidence-building to work out effective consumer choice.

But around 3 months into the job it looks like (and only on the last day did i realise) management was assembling evidence to boot me out. A report was drafted and the managers agreed i should not pass probation.

Comments made to me were:

* Couldn't get a piece of R  work done on time (the code was done by another team member and malfunctioning. Worse still, another team member left it half done and didn't touch it for a month. I was effectively blamed for that.)
* Didn't understand a concept around a productivity measure (i did, but the data i relied on another organisation to give it to me was never there - so i tried alternative measures which didn't make sense)
* Inability to let things go (true - i kept thinking someone had a problem with me so i made sure i didn't do something wrong by accident)
* Asked too many questions (could have told me to stop, and would have)
* Attention to detail lacking sometimes (in the cases they raised, they said it was ""fine""...ugh)

Some things said of me wasn't really true, so i think a part of it was that i didn't click with the team (esp. the managers).

But i don't care about blaming people. I care about making sure this never happens again. How do i reflect on this?

I have interviews lined up, and i'm actually in close contention for one position (they didn't get this employer's reference and accepted the reason i gave - which technically is not a lie). 

How can i be sure if i get a similar position, i don't fuck it up? I can't bear giving up on an economist career (at least for a while) after this failure, but is being an economist even right for me?

Help me reflect on this.

"I’m a 29 yo flight attendant. If you were in my shoes, would you tough it out and keep flying until you can retire or start over? What else would you transition into?","Growing up I was a typical straight A student/cheerleader/overachiever who never really put much thought into what I wanted to be when I grew up. I did what everyone else was doing and went to college where I gained a bachelors of science with a 3.5 gpa. I initially thought I wanted to go to pharmacy school but changed my mind after finishing the prerequisites & working a couple years as a full time pharmacy technician. At that age I wasn’t motivated by money (I am now) and felt like I would be bored to death performing quality control on medications everyday. Soooo it was a NO for me. Instead of quitting altogether, 3 years in, I made the decision to at least finish what I’d started and spend my 4th year putting my credits towards a biology degree. (Full disclosure, Low scores on the PCAT exam & HIGH stress levels trying to study and balance life played a role in this choice...) Fast forward to today, I cannot see myself going back to school to do anything else in the healthcare industry. Just watching shows like greys anatomy or botched and the thought of more student loans make me VERY nauseous. 


Prior to college and since graduating, I’ve had various roles in hospitality/customer service: cooking, hosting, catering, serving, bottle service/bartending, etc and have been lucky enough to keep a position as a flight attendant for the past 6 years. 
In the beginning, it was GREAT! I traveled the world and never really saw it as “work” but for the past almost 3 years, that’s changed drastically & I’ve had a daily internal struggle over what else I can do with my life. The actual job itself is EASY but the lack of sleep = constant jet lag, living out of a suitcase, time alone/away from loved ones, and just having to be personable all the time is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m depressed and I know it’s because of my current lifestyle. I used to just enjoy my time alone at home on days off but I’ve become such an introvert that I barely want to leave the house/hotel rooms or talk to anyone now at all unless I HAVE to. Im never rude to passengers and have a perfect attendance record, but when I work with so many bubbly personalities and see people who genuinely want to go above and beyond inflight, it just confirms even more that this role isn’t for me anymore. I’m not sure if I’m just getting older and care more about consistency, stability, & work/life balance or just bored with life in general and need to stick with something that will stimulate my mind. I wish I had some sort of passion I could be pursuing in my down time, but I don’t. I thought about teaching and became a substitute for a year but couldn’t see it as a long term career either. I’m afraid I have already become complacent like many of my colleagues who’ve been flying an average of 20-40 years yet have the same complaints I do. With everything being seniority based, they say things get better with time but I’m not convinced. Also I barely use my flight benefits so they aren’t a factor keeping me “stuck” 


I STAY on indeed & the career section of so many companies & apply for jobs constantly but I’m also constantly rejected for positions I’m qualified to do (flight attendant supervisor, recruiter, instructor, anything hotel related etc) and I don’t have the experience or education required for anything outside this field paying a decent salary ($60k +). My degree is pretty much useless other than the fact that it shows I’m “smart” but clearly not smart enough to figure out a better life path. Anyone I’ve ever confided in has said “you’ll figure it out eventually” but like I said, it’s been years and I still haven’t found my calling. I’m grateful for the paycheck/benefits and understand that many ppl do not ENJOY their jobs but my job has become my entire life and I’m no longer enjoying much of it at all. "
I'm 31y old and want to start a career that makes me financially stable in 10 years. Software Development maybe?,"Hi

After jumping jobs for about 10y i think its time to focus and learn something. I Know im a little old already but i'm thinking starting a career on software development. I already know a little about programming but what courses should i do?

Thanks in advance for the help, please if you think another career is better im all ears."
How do you carefully explain to recruiters that you needed to take a break after your last job without creating any suspicions about your character and capability?,"I don’t plan on telling future recruiters how terrible my past job was even if there is a chance they might have heard about it (yes, the company is that notorious). I know enough to never bring that topic up in interviews and to just leave it all behind the past. But how do I carefully explain that I needed to take a break and a possible two month gap of unemployment? 

The truth is, my job burned me out and was becoming unhealthy for me physically and emotionally. Almost every day I have to worry about colleagues that might try to sabotage me, I work with people that do not care about properly guiding you through a process you aren’t familiar with and I’m constantly bothered with the realization that this job wasn’t for me in the first place. I stuck around just long enough to have my evaluation, which was fortunately positive and then decided I have done enough. 

I might have depression, I’m seeing a professional for this and for any possible treatment. I don’t want to bring any of this baggage to my next job so I’m doing everything I can to become healthy again. 

How are you supposed to spend your break when you’re trying to heal from extreme burn out and sudden loss of confidence? And what other way is there to carefully explain to future employers that you needed a break without sounding like someone who couldn’t handle the pressures of corporate life? "
Is it normal to outgrow a job after 2 years?,"I'm a young worker, at my first full time post out of undergrad.

I am at a small (<30 people) company. For the sake of this, let's say I'm a ""Financial Analyst II."" I started as a Jr Financial analyst. In the short 2 years, I have gotten several significant pay bumps, got positive praise, etc. I am doing fairly serious work for someone that's 25. Worth noting that from the start, I never planned to spend my whole career here. 

Outside of some minor gripes that could happen anywhere, my company is pretty awesome. My pay package is awesome. The working hours aren't terrible. And it means something that the higher ups have specifically made a focus of ensuring I get taken care of.

At the same time, I just feel totally checked out as of late. I can't really find the motivation to be *truly* interested in my job this point. I don't feel like I'm learning any new tangible skills. I don't really feel like I'm getting any mentorship for what I want to do. None of the people around me are really on the same career 'track' I'd like to be on. Plus, a lot of the processes in my small company just feel very ""Mickey Mouse.""

I'm hesitant to up and leave. Since my job is fairly good, and my particular industry is pretty niche, good opportunities don't come up all the time. I would consider going back for an advanced degree, but it would likely not get me higher pay than I'm getting right now. And the other option is going into a 'professional services' job in consulting or finance (I should be qualified), but I'd be going in fairly entry level, and likely getting paid a bit less for way more stress.

I do feel like I'm losing my sanity in the job, and I know it's not a home for me long term. At the same time, the actual factors involved with the job are really good - golden handcuffs even.

Has anyone been in this situation before?"

"27, associates degree and stuck in a dead-end job. No real passion or direction, but a strong desire to better my life. Where do I even start?","I'm 27, married and have an associates degree from a good community college. For the last few years i've been working as a medical assistant at a family owned place. The pay isn't great, I get no benefits and there's no room for advancement. The work is fine, though it's not something I particularly enjoy or anything.

I need to find a better job; one with better pay and benefits. I want to start improving me and my wife's life, and getting a career seems like the first step. The problem is I have no clear passions or a sense of what direction i'd like to move in. My life-track has kind of been just the default for a while without me really making many decisions. Go to high school -> go to community college till you figure out what you want to do -> get a job until you figure out which bachelors degree you want -> still stuck here.

I'm a pretty hard worker with pretty average intelligence. The closest thing I have to a passion is computers, though i'm not sure i'm cut out for computer science/programming. I don't know what I want to do, and the fact that i'm already 27 without a clear path forward scares me. I'm afraid of wasting even more time and want to work towards something but I can't figure out what, and don't know how to even begin figuring it out. I'm not really sure what kind of advice i'm looking for, but I figured this would be a good place to just reach out for help and guidance."
I switched majors 3 times. I am about to switch again. Is this a good idea or am I being insane?,"Hey, this story turned out pretty long so thanks in advance for reading it. 

Alright so most subjects in school didn't really interest me. I only liked Dutch, English and art. Unsurprisingly, my grades were quite bad. Luckily they were good enough to pass. 
After my graduation I had no idea what to study so I took a gap year and started working at Burger King (very impressive, I know). After a year I decided I wanted to study social work. Well that didn't work out for someone with social anxiety like me. I also didn't really enjoy the classes. After quitting I went back to working at the lovely burger heaven. I couldn't really stand that for much longer, so I started studying again. I picked goldsmithing for this. Yes, that made sense to me. See, I've always loved drawing and painting so I figured I'd do something creative. But I didn't enjoy the sawing, soldering and all the other technical aspects of the subject. After quitting I started working at a factory to ""save up"". Note: I used to spend my money like you would spend the toilet paper after eating an extra spicy burrito. At this point I went through a couple of miserable months. I eventually ended up at the airport with only 100 euros, about to go to Madrid. If it wasn't for my ex who stopped me, I would probably still be bathing in some Spanish ditch right now. Anyway, after this fiasco my friend suggested I should go for a course that allows me to only attend school once a week, while working the other 4 days. This seemed perfect for me since I would be able to achieve a certificate by experiental learning. The only subject that offers this kind of education here is cooking so I went with it. Bad decision once again, because man... I am way too dreamy and inattentive for this kind of job. It's also very exhausting and I get no free time anymore. So now, at the age of 20, I'm considering quitting again and starting a graphic design course, because I truly love design and I can seriously stare at a computer screen for lifetimes, trying to create a perfect photograph or logo. I also have a great passion for photography, but a lot of people can't really earn a living with that so I go for graphic design. I am really unsure about this though, because I'm afraid I will dislike this as well. Is quitting again a good idea, or will this just cause me to become used to giving up, rather than fighting? If I go for a new start, how could I get myself to make it work this time? Also, would it be a good idea to study the subject abroad?

Thanks again for reading this long ass post and here's an imaginary potato. :) "
How to deal with aggressive know-it-all co-worker?,"What does it mean if coworker's first response to something they don't understand is ALWAYS ""this is wrong""?   And let's just say that there's a lot that he doesn't understand.

I'm constantly put on the defensive, and I fear co-worker is making me look bad.  

I've also never had a conversation that he didn't aggressively brag during.  Whatever the topic he relays it back to his resume, ""years of experience,"" and ""degree in X."". Fine things to say for a job interview, but he was hired over a year ago and still talks about his resume every conversation.  His skills do look better on the resume than in real life.  

He'll say things that are objectively wrong, but sound technical so no one but me understands that it's b.s.  

He's very protective of his work and hiding it from the review/QA of others.  But he also sticks his nose in other people's work, micromanages his reports, and tries to micromanage people who aren't his reports.  

Management doesn't get into the technical details.  How can I make them see my coworker for what he is?  "

I'm hand-holding her through this whole process because she's overwhelmed and of course I'd do anything to get her where she needs to be. We're torn between two career paths for her - teacher or nurse.

The way I see it, teacher = 4 yr degree, testing, then employment at an elementary school - she loves children, the hours are pretty nice, summers off, decent benefits. Yeah, teacher salaries are pretty low, but she'd only be supporting herself. I'm a substitute teacher and I think it is so rewarding and fun and I know she'd be great at it, she agrees.

Nursing is something she's been vaguely interested in for a while, and she could get an Associate's in nursing, start working, and work on her Bachelor's while she does so. The money is about the same between teacher and ADN, but better if she has a BSN. Other than that idk much else about nursing. Personally I wouldn't like working in a hospital poking people with needles but she thinks she would love to work maybe in midwifery/maternal/neonatal care.

I am trying the best I can to lay out a very detailed timeline of what EXACTLY she needs to do to pursue either of these, starting with testing, pre-reqs, admission to a degree program, and everything leading up to employment, and the lifestyle with it. 

Anyone have advice for my dear later-in-life student mother? :)"
"Happy workers of reddit, how did you find your calling?","Howdy, I don’t really post on here to often. I was just wondering how some of you folks that are actually happy with your careers discovered it. Feeling lost in the world as I’m 29 and still don’t know what I wanna be when I grow up. I’ve worked a decent variety of jobs over the years but have yet to find anything I actually enjoy getting out of bed and doing, let alone dedicating my life too. For a back story, here’s some things I’ve done and decided it wasn’t for me after doing it for a time. 

Rave DJ - ended up parting and getting wasted to much to not die before I hit 30. Not a productive lifestyle when your 19.

Army medic - I was good at it but wasn’t full bought in on the military life style. After 10 months of sitting on a random base in Kuwait   during deployment decided not to re-enlist.

Asbestos and mold testing field tech - ok income but the job got super boring after a year and a half. Also decided that my income was pretty much as high as I was gonna make without a degree.

Golf Coarse Manager - it’s a chill college job but no interest in doing this long term. I also hate golf after dealing with golfers all day.

Currently going to school for criminal justice on GI bill but the program is to easy and feel like I’m just using the degree to try to get into a better masters program. Not as interested in becoming a police officer as I was 2 years ago. Can’t really change majors without paying for classes on GI bill so finishing it out. 

Anyways, feel like I’m being more proactive than just sitting around but still yet to find something that I actually enjoy. Hoping for some tips from people to find something that is actually meaningful and will pay the bills. I don’t feel like I’m lazy or anything but I’ve never worked a job I actually enjoyed. I was thinking emergency management or fire department but it’s hyper competitive where I am. My fiancé has a pretty good job where I am so wouldn’t wanna move on a gamble that I might like it more. Any tips or ideas would be appreciated!

Company went ghosting on me after job offer. Tomorrow is the “start date”. What should I do?,"Hello, 

I’m just writing because I find myself in a really weird situation. A month ago I interview at the BBC for a really good job  (35k£ entry level) 

After a week I receive a phone call from one of the recruiters saying I had gotten the job and she would later send me all the information via e-mail. During the phone call she did say who my manager would be as well as the starting date.

After that nothing.


It has been two weeks now and I have kept chasing this recruiter for an official letter/confirmation but I got nothing. A couple of days ago I have also called the main office and was told by a Manager that he would make sure the material got to me by the end of the day but I got nothing from that too.

Tomorrow is the day I am supposed to start (at least based on what the recruiter said).

What should I do? 

At the moment the only idea is to show up at the reception and see what happens because I don’t know what to think anymore.

Don’t know if any of you had ever been in a similar situation. 

UPDATE:

Showed up at the office today and they were expecting me. Induction day today. Thanks everyone!"
What is it really like being a lawyer?,"For context, I'm a freshman in college. I'm currently planning on becoming a lawyer. I don't want to work in court, but instead would rather work with documents (don't know exactly what it's called). Something like IP or environmental law. However, I really don't know much about what it's like being a lawyer in general. I've heard that it's nothing like law school. So for all current and past lawyers, what is the job really like? What are the people like? What hours do you work? What did you do there? What kind of skills does it require? Is it ever exciting and interesting, or is it usually tiresome? Is the pay worth it? How was your life impacted by your job as a whole? And have you ever regretted going into law?"
Should I leave my first ever job at a great company after 14 months for a senior position at a startup with awesome benefits?,"After graduating college, I got super lucky and landed a job at a very good tech company as a technical consultant. As happy as I am here, career progression is very important to me and the red tape of a large company bothers me. Of the college hires that I started with I feel that I’m one of the best performers, so I have been asking for more responsibility and work to pursue a promotion. However, it just doesn’t seem like I’m getting the opportunities I want and there’s no clear timeline for a promotion. 

I haven’t been looking for a new job but decided to try out interviewing when contacted. To my surprise I actually have an offer from a late stage startup that seems to be doing very well. It would be roughly a 15k raise with equal if not better benefits in a senior role.  

Should I entertain this offer to leave a well established  company for a startup so early in my career and only 14 months into my first real job? Should I stay where I am to have 2 solid years under my belt? Or really what kind of due diligence should I do before deciding one way or another."
Why do hiring managers tell you at the beginning of the interview they are interviewing other people?,I personally think this is quite silly. It’s a given that they would do this so why waste time saying this. It put a real damper on the interview.
"I want to go into forensics, or be a blood spatter analysis, what grade in science do I need, and what colleges do I go to for this?","I’m 14, and I’m the eighth grade. I know I need a good grade in science, but I don’t know what types of colleges to go to for when I’m ready. Any help? I can answer any questions related

UPDATE: I spoke to my science teacher, and there is actually a science class in my high school dedicated to forensics. I think I know my career now."
I think I fucked up the last 24 years of my life. Should I go back to get another degree?,"I thought I always had everything in the bag. Graduate, go to law school, and then live an okay life. But as I worked an internship at a law office and was unable to take the LSAT this year (law school admission test) due to family reasons, I’m beginning to realise more and more that this may not be what I wanted.

Unfortunately, all the jobs I’ve been able to find with my useless BA degrees (Criminology/Film, God knows why) are in sales and marketing and that is definitely something I do not want to do for the rest of my life. It never actually occurred to me to try my hand at anything STEM related, but I’m beginning to think I should go back to school to get a BS instead. I literally have nothing else gunning for me except for some job experience (peer academic counselor) and good grades. It’s kind of depressing. I also have some stupid dream to work in the game industry someday and I’m nowhere near that at all. 

Thank you for reading and I would greatly appreciate any advice! I’m afraid of wasting the next few years of my life as well...or even the rest of my life in pursuit of something I may not even like in the end. "
I'm a well-educated person with many interests and hobbies. Why is it so hard for me to find a career I enjoy doing?,"I have a BS in finance and fresh out of college, worked at a couple banks as an analyst and hated the ""corporate-ness"".

I can't find anything I actually want to do for money. "
Why aren’t a lot of people majoring in Supply Chain Management?,"I live in LA and I always wondered why not a lot of people aren’t majoring in supply chain? From using google and searching up CSU and UC why are the majority of people majoring in Business Administrator/ Management. I mean I read articles how supply chain is a growing field and it will be growing even more in the next decade and beyond. However, Im thinking you don’t have to major in supply chain in order to work in supply chain right? I‘ve seen people in accounting and finance working in supply chain And even becoming logistics mangers. So my question is does it matter if you have a supply chain degree or not in order to work in supply chain?

&#x200B;

Forgot to mention I am majoring in both Accounting and Finance and wanted to see if it was better to major in Supply Chain Management or Business Management to work in supply chain."
how do you identify a bad boss in an interview?,"I know there are some obvious red flags like overtly being rude or being arrogant. Are any good questions to ask to reveal a bad boss that might not be as obvious ?

Everyone I have ever spoken to has only had good things to say about my boss. Including people that do not work at the company now but worked for him before. But after working for him a while, I finally know his real nature. He is a really nice guy and very personable, but he looks out only for himself. He is quick to place blame on others, especially those he manages, and does not share proper credit with his team when things go well. He does not stick up for his team and does not share opportunities for growth- instead he keeps those opportunities for himself and keeps them secret. He does not adequately thank his team for their hard work and basically wants to make sure that he is seen as the ""rockstar"" of the group while the rest of us are his little minions.

Are there any questions I could have asked during the interview process or anything else I could have done to get hints at these traits beforehand? 

How can you tell when a boss is BSing you in an interview versus is a genuinely good boss?"
I have access to 24 months of FREE scholarship! What should I do with it?,"Basically I'm a veteran and used my benefits to get an undergraduate degree. Currently working in government for peanuts.

I've been thinking about law or business school but I know that's just going to lead to failure or unemployment. What are some other degrees or studies or certificates worth pursuing?

How do you know if you're happy with a job? Is the grass greener on the other side?,"I have a well paid job for the LCOL area I'm in, and I like living here. My job is overall pretty comfortable with a ton of autonomy (maybe too much) and I pretty much have my systems in place. Some days I feel like I could make a good living by working here forever. Other days, there are some people I have to work with who I really don't like and they bum me out. 

How do I know when I'm happy? The alternative I face is to move out of the area for a job aligned with my skills in a more populated area. Or, I could stay where I am and find a job I could do and take a pay cut. 

How do I weigh the stressors in my current job with the potential stressors in another job? In other words, how do I evaluate whether the grass is really greener elsewhere? Is there some framework for thinking about stressors that will help me weight them in importance?"
Nearly 30 and still unsure what I would like to do as a career that I enjoy. Can anybody give me advice based on my situation?,"So as the title states I’m nearly 30 and having trouble finding something I would like to do that I enjoy. Currently I’m working at a call center as an escalations supervisor. I graduated with a degree in business admin (definitely something I regret).

When I was in college I really enjoyed my accounting classes and heavily considered changing my major to that. Also,I do like employee to employee Human Resources work. I’m interested in doing something in the medical or tech field as well but wouldn’t want to go back to school if it would take more than two years.

I’ve been doing a ton of research and introspection to get a feel of what I would be interested in but I’m really overwhelmed.  Any good sources or advice on how get going in the right direction?

Management is discussing changing my role from 9-5 to on call overnight. What should I do?,"So I work in client services in an account manger type role. It's currently a Monday to Friday 9-5 job. We have a new service where a file transfer happens from 12-3 AM overnight 6 nights a week. 

Management is discussing having me on call during that  file transfer in case of issues. Thing is I only started 6 weeks ago and didn't sign up for this. It was clearly communicated this was a 9-5 with work life balance. I work in client relations, so I'm not trained in IT nor am I a technical professional. 

You guys have any advice? 

FYI I think I would accept this if I were given a 30k raise, a work phone, and fully remote working option. "
"My wife has spent the last 5 years raising our children, what should she do now?","My wife is amazing. We decided years ago when we started having kids that she would take one for the team and fully commit to the stereotypical role of ""housewife"". She does the most amazing job and I value her more than she realizes. With this in mind, she's started to panic the closer we get to our children finally all entering the public school system. She never went to college and was raised in an emotionally and psychologically abusive environment growing up. With nothing but a high school diploma and a variety of retail and service job experiences to go on, I would love to hear about any suggestions or thoughts you all might have for what direction she should head in.

We've been talking about the possibility of her getting her pharmacy technician license or even looking in to becoming a medical assistant. Here's hoping you all can spark some new ideas for us!"
I have too much freedom at work and don’t know what to do with it. How can I structure my day and do more with my time?,"Too much freedom, no direction or motivation

Help, I have a job that affords me the luxury of complete autonomy to make my own schedule and generate my own work to do but I can’t figure out how to be productive and end up sitting around all day doing nothing. I’m sure to some people this sounds great but I feel worthless and useless and want to feel productive. How do I motivate myself to use my time?

I’m an environmental educator and my primary responsibility is to be a face at various events to talk to the community about the environment and how to deal with any wildlife related issues they might have. However these events aren’t too frequent and I have between 20-40 hours a WEEK to try to use.  My boss has given me complete freedom to work on creating new programs, create events, etc but I don’t have a clue where to start. I’m not an event coordinator by trade, I’m a wildlife naturalist and educator so I’m really struggling... 

Can anyone give me tips on how to make my time more productive and motivate myself to do more? Should I ask my employer for more structure? I’m afraid of causing concern and then over correcting and micromanaging me...

Remote workers: How to give notice over the phone?,"I’ve been with my current company for a year and seven months. It’s been a great place to work, a very supportive manager and excellent team. It was my first job after college, and I’m so thankful for all I’ve learned and the way I’ve grown. I had an opportunity to apply for a job that would get me much closer to my long term career goals sort of fall into my lap. I applied, had multiple interviews, even flew out to have a day of interviews with the executive staff. It feels like a perfect fit. 

I received an offer from the company on Friday, and need to give notice with my current employer. It’s not a great week to be doing so, as my manager told me in passing on Friday that she has almost no time on her calendar to talk to people next week. We all work remotely, so it’s not as simple as setting up an in-person meeting to discuss. What’s the best way to give my notice while being respectful of her and showing my appreciation for the opportunity to have worked here? I’m really struggling with guilt over quitting, as our team is chronically understaffed and I know it will be a major workload for others to pick up. Thank you in advance! 

TL;DR How to give notice the most respectful way possible when working remotely and a face-to-face meeting isn’t feasible?"
Are there any careers for me? 30 y/o physically limited and extremely introverted,"I have dropped out of school like 4 times because of my shyness/anxiety. Besides that, I hate it worse than anything. I'm sick of wasting my time studying bullshit. I never want to go back. I'd like to learn a trade, but I have physical limitations. I can't bend or twist and I'm not supposed to lift more than 50 lbs.

Are there any respectable jobs out there that I could possibly do? People laugh at me when I tell them my current job (janitor) and it hurts my feelings, maaan. And tbh, even though I'm an introvert, it's too lonely. I live alone, so I can go an entire work week (starting at 6PM after everyone else I know gets off) without seeing a single person.

I like programming, but I'm not very good at it and I don't think I'd ever be very good at it. I don't think I'm particularly bright. If I were being honest, I'd guess my IQ is something like 90-95. (I know that's ""normal"")

I've considered getting dishwasher job and maybe become a cook, but I'm not sure if anyone would be willing to teach me.

Does anyone have any other ideas?

BTW, I'm not trying to be rude to janitors."
How can I consider my boss's mental health?,"I'm planning on leaving this job for another soon. Boss doesn't know that, thinks everything is mostly fine, and I'll still be in the area when I switch so he'll likely realize he was part of the issue. He's not a bad guy, just a bad boss and not someone I would ever choose to spend any time with.

&#x200B;

What I worry about is that he's already experiencing some mental health issues in his position alone (he's relatively new to the position, got promoted after 15 years when his boss left and I came in to his old position a year later). He stresses constantly and doesn't seem to like much about the job in the first place. Now a coworker that we both work closely with is leaving, which will increase our burdens significantly. I want to leave as soon as possible and - based on interest I've gained so far - won't be leaving too long after this coworker.

&#x200B;

I worry that he will have some sort of mental collapse. The question is not whether or not I leave; I can't make my life choices based on potential outcomes out of my control. The question is: is there anything I can do to ease me leaving, to lessen the shock once I tell him and the burden once I'm gone?"
"I graduated college, I’m in a job with no growth opportunities, now what?","I (23F) graduated college with a BS in Health Science because I failed Nursing, I ended up not liking the clinical aspect anyways so I don’t wanna try it again.

I hate it, I’m over worked and under paid but I know I’m just using this for experience. Now I don’t know what to do with my life. I’m willing to go back and get a masters if anything but I am stuck. I’m open to anything, I just need some guidance. Any advice?"
"Wife is stuck in a career hole, what can I do to help?","5 years ago my wife graduated with psychology degree and planned to go to occupational therapy school to become an occupational therapist. Upon graduating, she applied to a school close to the city we live in, and did not make it in. This was apparently normal for this school, and a few people she knew that had been accepted told her to get some part-time experience in the field, and apply again the next year. This is exactly what she did and the second go round she got all the way to a second interview and crushed it. Thought for sure she had it this time, but, no. They told her the average gpa in that application year was the highest in history and they strictly stick to the higher pool. They spoke so highly of her, and begged her to apply again the following year. 

Well life happened, and bills need to be paid, so she really needed to land a decent paying job. She applied for a certain rental car company position and got it. Pay is decent, benefits and vacation are killer, but the hours and work atmosphere have taken a beating on her. Truthfully, she has hit the point where she hates her job. She will randomly apply to other jobs, and has received many offers, but the pay/benefits are exceptionally bad in comparison to her current job. She wants out bad enough that a pay hit is ok, but the offers received have been laughably bad. This really kills her motivation to keep pushing, and I truly don’t know what to do to help. I’ve told her to just quit to clear her mind and relax and it’ll happen, but she won’t do it. I constantly search for job openings in hope I can find something good, but she normally shoots down the ones I find. 

I have a good career and have been excelling and it partly makes me feel guilty how it’s worked out for me. I want her to have the feeling of self worth in her job that I know she yearns for, but I don’t know how to give it to her. She’s the love of my life, and I want nothing more than to see her happy. Her current day to day has really beaten her down. I really want to help her, but I can’t seem to find the right angle on it or what exactly I can even do to truly help her. 

I’m seeking guidance on what I can do to help without pushing her too much.  Good career options with her current degree are hard to come by and openings are few and far between. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

TLDR: Wife hates her rental car job, has a psychology degree, and I am seeking guidance on what I can do to motivate her and help her find a better gig."
What Jobs are at risk to automation AI? How to prepare?,"Well, guess this is a fairly straight forward question. What jobs are at most risk to automation by AI and software programs?

"Messed up big time with a useless degree, can someone help me career wise?","So back in 2017 I graduated with a 3.6 gpa at a 4 year university on the pre med track. Long story short, medicine isn't for me anymore and I won't be pursuing it. Currently I work as a lab tech at Inova hospital (hybrid job of lab bench work and information systems), and have been exploring career options as I have been working for 6 months.
Throughout thinking and exploring, I became very interested in IT and cybersecurity so I am thinking about getting certs to get a job. I have been applying to tech companies but have not gotten a job or interviews mainly due to the nature of my major and experience.
I'll be honest, money is a big factor in all of this as I have 90k in student loans. I feel as if i cannot obtain a high paying job (currently $22/hr) with this major, unless I obtain a Ph.D or higher education, which I am not trying to do with all this debt. Are there opportunities for me to have a successful and lucrative career as I am now, or should I switch to IT/cybersecurity as i can see myself being more passionate about it. I love working with computers and am curious about coding languages and such.

While humanities will always have my heart I don't feel like I'm getting the mental stimulation that I crave. I don't want to go into counseling or clinical work which basically makes me degree worthless.

Now I'm not to sure what i want to pursue for my masters but more so I don't know what I want to make a career out of. 

My question to all of you is with someone as young as me, is there anything you would have changed or done differently when it come down to deciding what career you wanted? Tell me about the degree's you've obtained and where you're working now. I am open to listening to everyone's achievements, and also anyone's downfalls as well because I've learned this life journey doesn't exactly have a set rule book.

\- Is this the career you wanted or did you end up on a total different career path?

\- Does your career give you the satisfaction you thought it would?"
Advice for a sleepy scientist?,"Hi everyone and thank you for your time. I'm not lazy, and I'm not dramatic. I just need a lot more rest than other people. I have OCD and an organ defect.

I feel like bigger companies might help with some expenses if I were to get an interview; however, with these companies I'm competing with so many applicants. 

I feel like smaller companies, where I'm competing with less applicants, might be preferential to locals because they probably can't afford to help with any travel expenses for interviews.

"What is a job that best meets these three parameters (if such a job exists): low-stress, well-paying, and in demand?","I know these parameters may seem impossible to meet, but I like to think my threshold for each is fairly low.

**Low-stress**: No crazy hours (late night, tons of overtime). No taking work home. Not super fast-paced. Not hard on the body/labor-intensive.

**Well-paying**: At least 50-60K a year.

**In demand**: Not impossible to find a job and, given enough time, should reasonably expect to be able to find a job at some point.

A bit more about my situation. I'm about to finish a student teaching practicum, and unfortunately I'm starting to see what teachers and former teachers mean when they rave against the terrible work/life balance of the job.

I love the actual act of teaching: being in the classroom with students, getting to know them, discussing interesting topics. They can be a bit unruly at times, but so was I in high school so I find it endearing even as I struggle to keep them orderly. But all the grading, lesson planning, contact with parents is just too much and the work day is never really over even after the last bell rings. I know I'll be burnt out by everything *around* teaching if I continue with it.

Long story short, I'm providing this background for a **fourth parameter: ideally this job won't send me back to school for a terribly long time.** I already have a Bachelor's, though it is in the humanities. An Associate's would be ideal, but wouldn't be opposed to something requiring a Bachelor's or Master's if I can more easily make the jump because of the credits I have from my Bachelor's, though I'm not sure how that works.

Essentially, I'm done chasing a dream job, which I thought teaching would be for me. I just want something that meets those three parameters above, and ideally the fourth parameter too because I've already been in school for a while, racked up debt, and just want to enter the working world ASAP so I can start making money.

Sucks that I kind of have to start over on my career like this, but I figure it's best to be honest with myself now than hate my life later because I've locked myself into a miserable occupation. If nothing else, I've at least gained a new understanding of myself and what I want in life. Sometimes you can't figure that out without some trial and error.

TL;DR: See title. Also, 4th parameter would be ""job that doesn't send me back to school for a long time."" I already have a Bachelor's in the humanities."
How do I tell my boss that I don't want to do a company wide presentation?,"***UPDATE***

I'll likely just do the presentation begrudgingly. I had a mini presentation that went well today which has given me some better feelings towards it.

However, I don't think people should be pushed to do what they don't want to do and they should create their own goals with their managers, not have things foisted upon them. Allowing people to grow at their own pace within their own bounds is crucial for authentic, healthy development.

Also there's a difference between being encouraged and being carelessly pushed.

Thanks to the nice people who commented!

-----------------------------------

It pretty much says it in the title.

I have manageable but very present social anxiety and despite this have taken on more and more team and client presentations over the past year. Now my boss is pushing me to do a company-wide presentation as a challenge. I haven't revealed that I have anxiety but I identified that I was proud of my group leadership in my performance review which is why I think I'm getting this 'push'. 

Frankly, I'm too anxious to. Already have lost sleep over the idea. It's too much of a jump too soon. I should add that this presentation has nothing to do with my day to day job and my boss isn't asking this of any other team member.

How do I communicate to her, in a professional way, that I want to decline this suggestion?"
Job for a young disabled model?,"Hello people of reddit,
I'm a 22 year old disabled young woman. It's a really long story and I don't want to bore everyone with trivial knowledge of my past. So the gist of my story is that I missed almost all of high school due to being very ill and hospitalized (I was given a month to live). I was told to not to go back to school because of how sick I was at the time but I did go back and got 24 credits in 10 months and got my high school diploma. After that I attempted to go to a local College but it was a terrible experience and I was yelled at by professors for being so disabled and when I tried to take a medical withdrawal they did not reimburse my money. I cannot use my right arm at all even though I used to be right handed I can use my left hand type but cannot write. I used to have dreams of becoming a forensic psychologist before I got sick but that takes years of post secondary education. I am currently unable to go to post-secondary education due to lack of funds and I cannot get a job due to my disabilities and so I have no way of saving money. My interests have always been either forensic psychology or history related. Before I got sick I was at a runway model because my mother was living out her childhood dreams vicariously through me. I never really liked modelling because I have always tended to be more scientific minded and despise the idea of fashion and all that. But I cannot even pursue Runway modelling anymore. Due to my disabilities, I can't walk in heels anymore.

TLDR Basically I'm a 22 year-old disabled ex model just looking to find a passion in life because right now my life seems like it's lacking purpose.

Any advice that anyone could give would be greatly appreciated :)"
How can a burnt out detective with limited skills outside of law enforcement find a new career?,"Background on me: 29 years old male currently working as a police detective. I’ve been in law enforcement since I was 21 years old and have been quite successful going down this career path (officer of the year award as a detective and other commendations). I don’t have much education and only have an AA degree. I’ve found my job skills are very limited to the field I currently work in. I truly have limited to no mechanical skills unfortunately. My best “skills” are probably how I can effectively communicate with others. 

I’ve come to terms that I am just unhappy with what I do for a living and am looking for a fresh start. I don’t want to be a cop anymore, I’m burnt out, and I just want to be a regular person again....the stress, the expectations and pressure that come with this job have really taken a toll on me...Does anybody have any suggestions or ideas on how I can use my current job experience either in the private sector or another way to monetize my skill set....I don’t even know what interests me at this point, I’ve thought about maybe looking into polygraph examinations but I’m afraid of betting on myself.

Is this email okay for reaching out to an old boss/mentor?,"Relationship ended well, I just wanted to update him on starting grad school and let him know he had a role in it. How is this email, specifically the last 2 sentences:

Boss suddenly changes his mind about the performance of people threatening to leave. Should I try this?,"I have a boss who just started in the company a couple months ago and is still trying to learn the ropes. I've been at this company for a couple of years now and have a very good track record (promoted twice, good relationships, etc). We have our performance reviews coming up and I asked my boss how he thinks I'm doing because I'm eligible for a promotion. I've been running the team in the absence of a manager while he was in training and learning about the company and I think I did a really good job of setting targets, delivering on all the goals and so on. No one in my team has done the amount of work I've done in such a short time.

My boss told me that he didn't think I did enough to be promoted and said he didn't know I was thinking about a promotion even though I brought it up several times over the past couple months. OK, no problem, I was thinking maybe me running the team on my own and making sure that the team performed very high in the absence of a manager wasn't good enough so I'll just have to work harder.

Well, I just found out that my co-worker who received feedback that he was not meeting targets and that he wouldn't be getting a good review just last week has now told my boss that he is leaving the company for a higher paying job. And guess what? My boss started telling him that he will get a very high rating if he didn't leave, that he was doing great, he can still change his mind, etc. I also have an offer from another company but I don't like the job so I wasn't planning on taking it. Should I tell my boss that I am planning on taking it since he seems to magically change his mind and bump up ratings of people who are threatening to leave? I don't really have much to lose as I am not planning on staying too long after this anyway. He's been gaslighting me for months and giving me ""feedback"" on how I shouldn't talk in meeting unless I'm asked a question and now apparently I'm not showing leadership. Any advice?"
What is a decent job that only requires a 1-year training program?," Hi, I am asking for a friend who is interested in immigrating from Vietnam to Canada. They have a Masters Degree in Chemistry, but that certification won't directly transfer over. So they are looking to enroll in a 1-year study program, which can be converted into a 1-year work visa and build up language/cultural skills, pay off rent and tuition, then eventually transition to a long term career.

25 year old female, introverted. 2yrs work experience in an office, admin work.

Preferred job types:

* ""Technician"" type of jobs that can take advantage of a scientific background
* Like working with people

* Ultrasound / Pharmacy /Blood Technician / Dental Hygienist / Massage Therapist would be great but they all **require 2+years of school** which is too much time/money.
* Something like bartending would be good, but it isn't a legitimate 1 year college program so you cant get a study permit for it

Open to many ideas as there are always so many jobs out there that we never think of!

Non-preferred Job types:

* Not coding
* Not manual labour (no construction, roofing, garbageman, oil rig, auto garage etc.)
* No citizenship / drivers license required (not military, not air hostess, not bus/truck driver)
* Must cost $15000 or less in tuition... this is many years worth of savings in foreign currency
* Must be a 1-year study program"
My mom and stepdad (early fifties) are poor and unskilled—what can they do to make more money?,"Hello,

I'm not asking for advice for myself but rather my mom and stepdad, who are in their early fifties. They're both immigrants from Vietnam. My mom came here about 25 years ago. She's currently a citizen and can speak enough English to communicate but not understand grammar or more technical things. She does nails at a nail shop owned by her friend, but business is extremely slow. My stepfather came here just two years ago. He doesn't speak English and currently works for minimum wage at a Chinese restaurant. They make under $30,000 a year combined.

What should they do at their age and skill level to make more money and improve their lives? My mom could make a lot more money if she worked at another nail shop, but she doesn't want to do anything besides manicures and pedicures because doing fake nails requires use of harmful chemicals, although it makes more money. I think she's counting on my uncle, her brother, to help her buy her own nail shop. He's an occupational therapist and makes decent money, but there's no guarantee he'll help her. Also, he's out of work at the moment.

My stepdad seems to have settled in to his minimum wage restaurant job. He has a license to do nails, but he doesn't seem interested in it. He probably should have gone for a hair cutting license, but they decided against it for some reason.

I was thinking (although maybe it's not too realistic) that my mom could take English classes and then attend college to get a degree in something, like nursing. While she's not working, I could help her out a bit. Maybe my stepdad could do something similar. If not, though, what are some good options for them to make more money and increase their standard of living?"
What is the best way to handle a highly influential but difficult subordinate?,"I work part time lecturing at a small college.  I do it on the side because I really really enjoy it.  When I joined another professional joined and we have taught together over the last several semesters.  After the first semester I was asked to coordinate for the course, basically insure that all the sections were the same--i.e. students got the same content regardless of professor.  Both of us have very different styles, but in the end we teach the same material.

&#x200B;

Early on I recognized that our course needed updates, I worked with admin and got those updates implmented.  Needless to say, those changes have not been well received.  I solicited the other professor for feedback on numerous occasions without success, so in essence all changes were my changes.  Now with all of the new material, I get passive aggressive messages about when are we going to stop changing (with cc to multiple admin levels for the tiniest detail).  Also the individual has stopped communicating directly with me.

&#x200B;

Here's my conundrum--this person is a C-level executive at their normal job and I am basically a peon.  They bring a ton of prestige to the program, while I bring only my wit and excitement for teaching.  In addition to the above, there are several 'unprofessional' behaviors (nothing scandalous, this is academia, so just think 'rude') I have observed during conferences--this person is obviously aware of their import and like to remind everyone of it.

&#x200B;

How do I deal with this individual. What are some strategies to at least get this person in line with what we want to teach without undermining me at every step.  While I am technically 'in charge' of the course, I have no power to sit them down and say ""We need to address this behavior"" and every meeting I have ever scheduled has been blown off (even before any changes were made, we've always had a distant relationship)--in addition our teaching is remote.  My admin is sympathetic to my plight, but I know that the students sense the friction (he \[ed. sorry typo\] openly badmouth me in his classes, perhaps forgetting that everything is recorded, and me watching his videos is my way of making sure we are synched, while I release my notes/slides/videos to all sections) and our teaching has diverged to the point where he blew off the final I wrote, something I was very passionate about as it gave our students some real-world style experience."
"Are there any well paying jobs, that don't involve sitting around in an office?","I've always wanted to go to university, so I can get a job that pays me well, but to be honest, I don't want to spend my life sitting around in an office doing who knows what. I've gotten to a point where I feel like I'd rather work on a construction site for less than minimum wage than do anything involving IT and/or offices.

I like drawing, and being creative, and while it's still an office job somewhat, I'd actually be interested in working for a game company, to do art for them. 

I don't know if I'd be able to find a job as an artist though, so I'd like to ask what other options I have in case that doesn't work out

What’s your advice for a 40 year old career changer?,"Hello. I’m a newly single mother. I have a BS in psych but I’ve been working call center/customer service for years $15/$17 hourly. I’m newly single and I want a better career: but I’m 40! 

Here’s what I’ve been considering: 


I could get a masters in special education. Building on some experience I have in working with special needs populations the money isn’t so great it it’s a stable job and I have little kids 


I could get a second BS on accounting and become a CPA (stable and good money. But I’m old for this?) 

I could study and be a tax preparer (faster and less competitive than accounting) 


I can stay in call centers and hope that I can pay my bills each month. (I hate this idea) 

What advice have you? 
Any input or suggestion is appreciated

"Headhunter got upset after I turned down job, revealed a signing bonus that was never mentioned. Is this common?","I am a remote contractor and was contacted by a headhunter with an opportunity at a local firm. I interviewed, they liked me, and made me a job offer. Offer good, but not good enough - about a $10k income drop plus a 30 minute commute and all the other unknowns that come with a new job.
Odd stuff occurred as well, hiring manager called me and said headhunter asked him to give me a call, “he didn’t really know why” and then said, “do you have specific questions on your offer?”
What offer?
Turns out they had sent an offer letter that day. So he gives me the verbal, and it is ok, but doesn’t make me giddy, and I say, “thanks, I’ll look it over.”
It’s Friday. Takes them a while to get me a benefit premium breakdown. Insurance costs lower, but numbers don’t add up, I still have a $10k deficit. I like working remotely, in an earlier time zone, in my PJs. So I call the hiring manager and tell him it is a soft no, and he says, “well if you change your mind we have a lot if hiring to do.”
Headhunter emails me saying, “what happened? I specifically told you to contact me if the numbers were off. We have a significant amount of money earmarked for this situation. I guess I’ll never understand.”
So three things struck me:
1) the assumption that it was the money (well, TBH I made the mistake(?) of telling them what I was making, so she knew there was a gap)
2) this “significant amount of money” was never mentioned until after the fact
3) the “I guess I’ll never understand” makes me think this same scenario has played out at least once (and probably several times) before.

I think I am going to stop using headhunters. In my last 2 interactions, I was harassed to disclose “the number I would take”. I guess I’ll never understand."
My boss is asking me to do things outside of my job description. I'm afraid it's getting out of hand. How can I turn this around?,"I recently started my first full time job out of undergrad. I'm a creative writer. That's what I'm qualified to do. That's what I know. The job is at a small law firm, and I was hired to run the blog, help draft damages letters, and so on. 

A few weeks ago, things were going well. I was writing regular blog content and spicing up things that needed to be sent to defendants or shown in court. It took a bit of a learning curve, but I was completely on top of it. 

Then my boss decided our website needed a redesign. I thought he'd outsource the design and have me write the site text. I showed him some other sites I thought were well designed and pointed out how design language could be used to engage potential clients. Suddenly I was in charge of the design. 

Right away, I told him that despite having some limited knowledge of good UX principles, I was not qualified to do an entire website. He told me that I'm ""smarter than I think."" 

Now I've been working on the site for a few weeks. I got him to let me use a pretty dumbed down website building tool so that it would look nice despite the fact that this isn't something I've done before. He keeps asking me to add in animations and build pages that a) this building tool doesn't allow for and b) that I wouldn't know how to create even if it did. 

Every time I present something to him, he wants something even more technically impressive. I keep coming just close enough to what he previously wanted for him to up the ante again. 

He also asked me to design an entire digital marketing strategy spanning multiple domains we own, and including ads etc.

I'll say it again. I am a writer. I write a lot, and I write well, but I am not a visual creative, nor a programmer, nor a web expert. At this point I'm barely doing any of the things I was initially hired to do. 

My boss isn't malicious. He is getting carried away, and doesn't listen to outside opinion. I've communicated my lack of knowledge every time he asks for something. I don't know what to do. How do I stop this train from derailing?

Edit: a lot of good feedback here and different ways of approaching the situation. I appreciate it. "
"Want to quit my first job after the first shift, what do I do?","I'm 18 and never had a job, so when I got an email saying I got accepted for the position of kitchen porter at a restaurant up town I was ecstatic. I thought, kitchen porter you just wash dishes and take out the bins, easiest thing ever! plus its £8 an hour plus tips. I thought I must have lucked out big time. But after 8 hours straight of nothing but washing dirty dishes, getting wet, moving around heaps of clean dishes and pans and knifes, mopping the floor at the end of the day, cleaning everything, drying everything, just when you think you maybe have done the bulk of the dishes and can relax a bit thats when the clock turns 8 and a tsunami of customers come in and you realise the past agonising 5 hours were mere childs play. on many occasions i thought about just completely walking out and not looking back. On my break they gave me something to eat which was nice (if only i didn't have to eat it on the fire exit stairs because the lounge was full) when eating it i found my self with tears pouring down my face onto the plate. After my 20 minutes were up I got back to it, and when the day was over and everything was as good as new for the chefs in the morning I finally got to go home at midnight, straight to bed with aching muscles everywhere. When i woke up i find that i can't move my right wrist too well and have rashes on both arms. my next shift is in 3 hours and i'm so tempted to not show up, sure the job is ""easy"" as in easy to understand what to do and where things go, but fucking hard physical labour. I talked about it to my mum but she said i must not quit and that its always like that. I'm torn between the dread of everyone being disappointed in me and the dread of having to go back to it all for another 8 hours. whether i should care about my physical and mental health or care about if everyone sees me as a failure. what the hell do i do?"
Does your companies Glassdoor review realistically represent what its like to actually work there?,"Too positive? Too negative? Just right? I'm curious to know how accurate you believe your companies online appearance is. I'm just trying to figure out how much stock I should be putting into company reviews on my job search.

I think my current company is well represented, some comments I feel are a bit ridiculous, but for the most part, it's pretty close, if not a bit too positive (we were all asked to publish a Glassdoor review to combat a few negative reviews from disgruntled workers)."
Unclear how to ask for a raise in my circumstance?,"I have been working at my current employer for about 11 months and since the beginning of this year, my duties and responsibilities have changed dramatically. Although the salary I was brought in at was competitive for the duties the old job description entailed, my new “title” and responsibilities can command quite a bit higher (30% or more) should I shop around.

The way I see it, I have 3 obstacles that I can’t think of ways around:

1) The raise I’m looking for would require a corporate paygrade promotion also (I believe). I honestly would feel awkward even asking for that number

2) My performance review is at least another 3 months away and my employer does not really have a very clear policy on how raises and promotions will work. Especially since a colleague of mine (who has been working with the employer for 10 yrs) mentioned that when she asked for a raise, she only mentioned her intentions to our direct supervisor and then spoke directly to the department head for her raise.

3) Timing. We had just finished Phase 1 (where I contributed quite a bit especially since my direct supervisor was on maternity and I handled part of her work then) a pretty long term three phase project, however an audit is beginning soon and won’t end for another month. All “raise/promotion” asking advice seem to revolve around finding the right time to ask which given how many projects are down the line, is difficult for me to pick out.

Normally I wouldn’t think this would be a problem, but the friend I helped interview for the same position as my new title might officially begin by October and I’m worried that with his closer to market salary, there might not be room in the budget for them to give me the raise I want (this fear may or may not be unfounded, I actually don’t know what it looks like from the other side).

This is actually the first time I’ve ever asked for a raise, as usually when I feel underpaid, I just move on to a different position (usually with a better title also) so any additional insights would be most appreciated."
"33, getting trapped in food service/retail?","So I do have a degree, and several years ago I worked for a financial services firm. But they were lay offing people and I decided to do a coding boot camp, which lead to no job. Afterwards I worked in a restaurant for a few years.

It's been several years since then. I gave my resume to a recruiter and it sounds like I'm not getting call backs because there are too many resume gaps of ""real"" experience. I'm getting quite worried.

What's a way out of the situation? Unfortunately the trades are out of the question as I am poor with that type of work.

How do i get a job i have no experience in?,"Need some help with planning my career. So I got a B.A. in psychology and I want to go into marketing. But, I have no marketing experience. What can I do to gain the experience and skills to land a good marketing position? Had anyone been in a similar position and what have you guys done about it. Any advice if appreciated."
How do I negotiate salary when my responsibilities are doubling?,"Double the work equals double the money, right? If only life were so simple.

I've been working an admin job in luxury real estate, but decided I wanted to take on more responsibility. I highlighted my design/marketing skills gained through my old advertising career to my boss, and he wants to make me the marketing point person for my branch while keeping all my current admin duties.

Since I'll be effectively working two full jobs, wouldn't it be reasonable to be compensated as such? Doubling my salary sounds ridiculous on paper, but I'm wondering what a good percentage increase I could realistically aim for. Any negotiating tactics would be appreciated too. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks so much for the replies everyone! It seems there's a split between proving my worth and asking for a raise sooner as to not be ""working more for free."" I'm leaning towards asking for a raise now with the thinking that if my company trusts me with these increased responsibilities, they should respect my efforts enough to compensate for them. "
"Should I dump my current somewhat stressful job with better pay and rotating schedule for a 9-5 M-F, less stressful job with a $400/month pay cut?","I (25F) am a respiratory therapist at a huge hospital in South Carolina currently. I’ve been here for a year and a half (only RT job I’ve had). It’s primarily critical care and has a children’s side to. I work in both areas with a passion for pediatrics. The schedule is nice sometimes- 12 hour shifts but I only work 3 per week and off 4. But we’re required to work every other weekend. My boyfriend whom I live with and will soon be engaged/married to (within the next year or two) works 9-5 M-F. All weekends and holidays off. A lot of the weekends I work we want to do things together. Or go to things in th evenings but I don’t get off until 7. This isn’t a job I want to do forever but it pays decent. It’s very high stress and takes a toll on you emotionally. I see people take their last breaths regularly. It has a high burn out rate. 

A position opened up within my hospital group but it is an outpatient facility. It’s in their pediatric Pulmonology department. I would never work with critically ill, dying people. This is basically a regular doctors office but for strictly Pulmonology patients. It’s something I would LOVE to do. It’s 9-5 M-F. Boyfriend and I would share schedules. It’s a job I could see myself doing long term. I interview for it tomorrow. I may not even be offered it but if I am I need to be prepared with how to process it. The big kicker with this is I would take a $400/month pay cut. I have about $23,000 in student loan debt and about $12,000 in other debts. No mortgage or rent. I pay about $600 to loans monthly which is above minimum. All loans are 6% apr or lower. It’s a huge loss when I have so much debt I’m paying down. But it’s low stress, highly sought after, low burnout. People literally retire in this position. 

Do I suffer the pay cut and make it work? I can always pick up random Saturday shifts in critical care and make about $220 in one day. Those shifts may or may not always be available. But more than likely they will be. I could pick a Saturday, or a Sunday even, boyfriend and I have no plans and pick up money. That just puts me at working 6 days a week to make ends meet while I’m currently working 3. 

I’m just having a hard time weighing out the pros and cons. They’re about equal, but it’s basically finances vs mental well being. 

Edit: I feel it is safe to mention I DO like my current job. I have some great coworkers. It can be strenuous at times and mentally exhausting but very rewarding. If I absolutely hated it the decision wouldn’t be so hard. But I know I’d love this other position 10x more. And not come home mentally and physically exhausted everyday. 



Update:
The manager called me with an unofficial offer and do to some credentials I carried, it bumped my job code up and increased my starting pay to almost what I make now. It’s maybe 80c per hour different. However I will work 4 extra hours a week and end up breaking even. My decision was made for me! Low stress job, weekends off, same schedule as significant other, with the same pay!! 

Thanks for all your advice though. It did help tremendously. "
How many of you actually got to your current job by sending out resumés to job openings?,"I've been out of work and sending out CVs for close to 6 months now. I've gotten absolutely no interviews, and only a couple of rejection notices. It's mostly radio silence.

I've watched a couple of job seeking lectures on Youtube, and these guys are telling us that spending time on your resumé and sending out CVs is a waste of time. However (obviously) to really find out what's the cool, hip way of finding a job, you have to sign up for their $99 lecture in which they'll teach us everything.

I suspect most of those only aim to prey at desperate unemployed people.

However, I'm at a loss here, as sending out resumés and applying to job openings on LinkedIn isn't bringing me anything.

So, how many of you actually got to your current jobs through this method?"
"Work is increasing my hours by 25% while cutting my pay by 40%, what should I do?","I (24m) manage a bar/restaurant and have been struggling with the ethics approach that my company is currently taking in regards to COVID19. 

As of right now we're operating on a take-out only model and running a full menu with 2 to 3 people in the building. My stress level is through the roof, I work in an industry where I am at very high risk of contracting the virus, and amount of work that it is taking to run a full menu restaurant with minimal help is destroying me. 

My corporate office today informed me that they will be increasing my required hours to 60 hours per week while also cutting my salary by 40%

The pay I will be receiving equates to exactly minimum wage, if I were to work only 40 hours per week. The issue is that I'll be working 60 and won't be compensated at all for the work that I'm putting in. From what I understand, since i am a salaried employee and what they're doing is entire legal, but unbelievably unfair. 

The way this was done, I feel like I have been backed into a corner. I'm a recent college grad with a crippling amount of student loan debt and my unemployment would be based off of my college job, which was for significantly less money. I'm genuinely concerned about my availability to pay my bills and eat now, but the hours I'm being forced to work makes it impossible to find a second job. 

They gave me the option of being ""laid off"" and coming back once we reopen, but I'm fearful that they will try to drive me out if I chose to do that.

I can't just quit because I wouldn't be eligible for unemployment. I don't want to make this anymore difficult on my co-workers, but I'm trying to keep my mind open to all options. 

I feel like my only option is to ride this out for the reduced pay but I'm really struggling with the idea of working for a company that would do this to the handful of remaining employees that they have left. I honestly feel like them laying me off would have been a more satisfactory option for me.

In the grand scheme of things, I can't see myself wanting to work for a company that would respond in this way. I feel like regardless of my immediate decision I will try to find a new position at a new spot ASAP, but what would you do?


TLDR: My workplace is requiring me to work 60 hours per week at a minimum wage 40 hour/week rate, what should I do?"
Should I take a better paying job or be a “team player”?,"Throwaway to keep this off my main.

I (26F) have been working full time for a non-profit for 1.5 years.  

A few details about this job:

-pay is about $1,500 less annually than a living wage for a single adult in my city.  I have to work another (better paying) job part time to make ends meet/have any quality of life.  HOWEVER, we are getting a pay increase

-this position has had an extreme amount of turnover in the past few years. It’s on a small team which was being hired from scratch when I got there, because the previous team all quit within a few months.  More have quit since then

-the managers who have overseen all this turnover have been the same. It’s a small department, but my team works closely with our manager and her boss.  

-These two supervisors have very different management styles.  My direct supervisor (let’s call her Kim) is extremely lax, and likes to leave policies in gray areas.  Overall, I like Kim as a person, but this has been frustrating to work under since Kim’s boss, we’ll call her Kath, has extremely specific expectations of her staff.  Kath also really likes to stick to chain of command, thereby relying entirely on Kim to communicate Kath’s expectations to my team (which Kim doesn’t really like to do).

Anyway, this environment has led to an extreme amount of stress in my life and I decided, after a few months of escalating nonsense, to look for other employment options.  This current position also requires me to do some intense physical work, and my health has been declining rapidly since I started working here.

I’m now pretty far along in the process of interviewing for a much higher paying position at the company I currently work for part time.  The only problem is, Kim just announced that she will be leaving her position, meaning I would leave my teammates (who I care about and don’t want to inconvenience) scrambling to cover for both me and Kim should I leave. 

I’m also planning on moving away from this city, and both of these jobs, in the next year. 

So, should I take this new, better job for a few months, or stick it out at this miserable one so as not to hurt my team?


Edit:  thanks everybody for the validation. I knew I should leave, but needed help seeing past my catholic guilt lol. Just finished another interview for the new job, fingers crossed!🤞"
Whats a marketable skill that I can acquire in 2-3 months that can help me switch careers and work remotely?,"Hello all,

 I just recently left a decent paying job with long hours and a shitty boss. I am hoping to take the next 2-3 months to learn a completely new skill which can help me land a job that can allow me to work from home or remotely. I have no idea where to start.

Does anyone know someone that successfully did something similar?

I have 7 years professional experience in HR and a B.S degree inBusiness/Human Resources from a State University.


BTW, I'm in Southern California.

Thanks."
"My best talent is being able to mind my own business (the personal, not financial kind). How do I turn this into a career?","To find a career, I was asked to think of something I'm *good at*, not necessarily even something I *like*. The best thing I've got going on for me is making friends easily - most people like me more than I like them. This is because I don't butt into other peoples' business, share unwanted opinions, and keep out of other peoples' stupid squabbles.

 I'm bad at math, not good with machines, cannot emotionally handle working with children, animals or the elderly, and the humanities aren't a real job (trust me I've tried).

 Working in a factory and doing ape labour makes me violently suicidal.

 With a set-up like this, what's the best I could do? How do I make lemonade out of this?"
Changing careers from corporate world to... anything else?,"I've been with my company for just over 4 years, and have just changed roles 2 months ago. I'm not enjoying it at all - has a lot to do with the management structure. I go through cycles of ""everything is fine"" to ""I hate this and need a change"". This is my first ""real"" job after university and living in Vancouver I can't afford a pay cut. I've thought about going back to school, but with my government student loan where it's at that's not feasible. How does one change careers so early on? Do I just grin and bear it until I'm in a better place? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Edit: I should add that my current career is not related to my field of study."
Got offered a position in my company. Boss tried to back out of offer and give himself some wiggle room. What should my next move be?,"I'll try to keep it short. I'm currently an analyst at my company and was offered a logistic management position by my director. What prompted this offer is someone in my department got a promotion, and a different employee would be taking that man's job, and I would be taking that second employees job. I was excited for the new opportunity. The move is lateral in my company but it would of been something new with more money. Today around noon my boss (director) and a manager that works for him had a closed door conversation. Afterwards he approached me and the conversation went like this. He initially tried to say the offer was not set in stone, and that he thinks I would be better in my current role because this is a better fit for my intellect. That a different opportunity would happen down the line and that would be a better fit for me. He wanted me to agree with this but I kept it short and just said if that's what you think is best. Then he started to backtrack the first part of the conversation and say that he knows what he said to me sounded like this was set thing. Then. He tried to convince me on how a lateral move like that would not benefit me that much and tried to then complement me on how great I do my current role and that next level opportunity will come sooner than later. I am livid right bow because I can say with certainty something happened where one of these other folks spilled the beans about the promotions and someone got heated that I would be getting a promotion they wanted. So now my boss is backtracking my promotion but neither of the other two employees. What should I do here? Yes I'm going to be looking for new work, but what should I do here at my current job to mitigate this."
"Just published my first book, How to Write the Perfect Resume, free on Amazon. Check it out!","Hey everyone,

A couple years ago I decided that I wanted to steer my career in a direction where I’d eventually be working for myself full time, and although I’m nowhere near close to that point yet, I’m really excited about this first fruit of my efforts.  A little background on me: graduated ten years ago, live in the Bay Area, and have worked at some of the more notable tech companies here in SV.  Due to the decent success I’ve had on the job front, I’ve always been the “go to” guy in my circle of friends and family members for resume help and general career advice, and I had never really thought much about this until I had the idea that I could turn it into a full\-blown career.  The idea stuck with me and one day, I just started writing and continued doing so pretty much every day since for the past couple years.  This week, I’m proud to say that my efforts have finally culminated in a real, tangible product that I think \(hope\) is ready for the world to see.

For this first book, I took everything I knew about how to write a great resume and condensed it down into a comprehensive, step\-by\-step guide that anyone can use to shape their resume in a way that will truly capture the attention of potential employers.  There’s a lot of advice out there\-\-some of it good, some of it bad\-\-and I wanted to put my own spin on what’s worked for me and the others who I’ve helped land their target jobs.  The end result is something I hope can truly help people avoid the mistakes that land their resumes in the dreaded black hole and get them one step closer to finding a meaningful, fulfilling career path.

Anyways, the book is available for free on Amazon Kindle through June 8th, so be sure to get your copy before the price goes up.

Here’s the link: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DCDY77N](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DCDY77N)

Thanks and enjoy!"
Anyone here was or is a late bloomer in their careers? Why did it take so long for you? How did you cope?,Im not sure what to pick as a job that I can make a career out of. How can I stop comparing myself to other younger people that got their life together and making a living?
"26 and never pursued a career, where to learn about my options?","I've worked in retail since I was 18 and nothing else. I was interested in trades for a while and got a construction job but I walked out on my first day because I absolutely hated working in an outdoor and unprofessional environment.

I have no interests that can translate into careers. All I want is a job that pays well without having to spend too much time in school for, that I can do indoors in a professional environment. My greatest asset is that I can stay calm and composed no matter the situation. I'd prefer not to rely on people too much, I prefer working my job alone.

I've looked over nearby college courses and taking a few online career tests but nothing jumps out at me and it's hard to get an idea of exactly what each job is like just by reading about it. The only thing of mild interest is computer programming but it says on the website that you should be good at working with others and I've always hated relying on other people.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated, thanks."
Interview as a data analyst with no background: advice?,"So I've been looking to branch into data and I've managed to score an interview for an entry level position. However, the position requires a proficient amount of knowledge surrounding VLOOKUP, Access, and SQL (particularly Joins). 

Now normally I wouldn't have even gotten the interview since I don't have a background in this, but the hiring manager assures me that ""they can teach someone these things"". 

That being said, I've heard that before and it never worked out so what are some good resources I can use to learn the basics of each so I don't come in looking like a complete asshole."
"I've been trying to relocate and having a hard time landing anything beyond a phone interview, who has had success in this and how have you gone about it?","My boyfriend and I have been talking about relocating pretty seriously for a couple of months now.  I have been on a war path to tailor my resume to jobs, same with cover letters, and have gotten nothing but commission only sales positions calling me (of which I did not apply for).

&#x200B;

Obviously I can't just move without a job.  We are considering getting restaurant gigs so we are at least ""local"" and can take an interview easily.  We are both newer in our career paths, so its not like either of us have any sort of senior level experience that people are jumping on.  We are just trying to secure our future in an area we find more desirable, as well as learn a little about ourselves in the process!

&#x200B;

Its getting so frustrating because I am striking out left and right.  I've had folks tell me that although they believe that I sound very serious about what I am trying to do, we look like a risk because we aren't already living somewhere - how am I supposed to get a place to live without a job?!  I understand the risks in it for everyone involved.  I need some serious guidance on how to make this happen though."
Entry level jobs that teach valuable skills?,"I'm 22 and feel like I have no real skills that would help me get a decent job. Right now I'm an Aerospace Warehouse Support. For the most part I answer emails from branches and ship parts out to them or fulfill orders for customers. For example Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and a bunch of other places you've probably never heard of. I get paid $13 an hour (30 hours a week) and a little bonus every month if we meet certain goals. I want to start saving up for a house but I need something that pays more. Which I understand in order to get paid more I need a better job and those require skills.

So my question is what are some jobs a person without lots of experience or degree could get that teach valuable skills that could help me get a better job down the line? Also that pay better. (Excluding anything that has to do with sales, automobiles, and construction) 

As of right now I'm leaning to going to work for FedEx. My GF has a friend who is not the smartest guy, but after working there part-time through college he is now making over $100k a year. My GF's sister's boyfriend has been working there for around a year or so and is making $19 hour which probably isn't much to some people, but that's night and day difference for me."
How to find my path after 19 years at age 43?,"This is going to be a long read, and I apologize for it.  I've written this over 4 days and have tried to explain my situation as best as I can.  (It still seems to be a book, and I'm sorry about that.)

I graduated from college (BS, Economics) from a well-known mid-atlantic university in 1999. I was young, and I didn’t have a lot of direction. I wound up taking a job in Healthcare as an entry-level pharmacy technician, which was completely unrelated to my major. Initially, I had planned to stay there a year, two tops. By that time, I would figure out what I wanted to do and I’d start my destiny. But that’s not really how life works. I got very comfortable. I knew there was little to no upward mobility, but that was OK. The job was close to my home, my boss was friendly, the work was easy, and the hours were great. The pay wasn’t as high as I’d like, but for a recent college grad, living back at home, the money was just fine to both help my parents with bills and save some cash.

A few years after my hire date, I decided to continue working there while doing something I always wanted to do. I wanted to run my own company. I had/have solid IT skills. I was “that guy” that everyone went to in order to fix computer problems. Family, friends, and even at work I became the unofficial IT guy.  (With that added responsibility did come increased pay.)  I decided to monetize that, and I used my experience and knowledge to start an IT company. I went from 4 clients to over 1,100 (about 82&#37; of those repeats) and wound up running a very successful IT company for over a decade. I was young, I was able to work my 9-5, see clients till 9 or 10PM, work till 4AM in my basement repairing machines, and then get 3 hours of sleep to go back to my day job. I did this for about a decade, working most weekends from ages 24-35. Finally burning out, along with the industry changing, I closed the company when the disparity between income and expenses was getting too close. My wife and I also started our family, and raising kids and working 20 hours a day was not feasible for my own health or for being a parent.

I developed a good source of income from my computer company on-top of the “ok” income from the 9-5. I was able to start two 529’s. My children’s college will essentially be funded even if I never earn another dollar. I was also able to create a decent high five-figure nest egg which I have invested and don’t intent to touch.

19 years later, while I have moved up a little to Senior Lead Pharmacy Technician, the company has gone through several changes in ownership, and is now owned by a big company that you would definitely know.  I'm overpaid in the industry due to the length of time I've been there.  I’ve declined recent promotions because the local leadership is very poor, and the income increase for those positions is widely out of touch with the increase in responsibilities. Those positions would very likely kill me.  Very recently, many of my coworkers have resigned which has in some cases tripled the work the remaining people have to do which has presented not only unsafe situations for patients, but has induced a health-scare for me as a result of being overworked. My blood pressure skyrocketed the other day to unsafe levels, and it was completely work-induced. I don’t want to die at a desk in a job that I have come to hate.  I've come to the awakening that my departure is overdue.

I’m now 43 years old. I’m more or less in the same job I started in when I was 25. The roles have changed, the pay has increased, the responsibilities have increased. I need to find a new job, but I’m completely lost. I haven’t been on an interview in 19 years. I know how to write a resume, and I updated mine about 2 years ago in preparation for a move. I’m very well respected at my job, but they are suspicious as to why I don’t want the promotions. I am their lead performer in terms of branch metrics, as laid out by the company’s expectations. I simply no longer want to work under this atmosphere of the current leadership because it’s impacting my health. I’m at the point where I’m mentally OK with resigning before finding something else, but I know that is not a smart move. It is time for me to put my big guy pants on, and get out into the world and do something better to support my wife and kids.

**Here is my problem**: I don’t know what I can offer someone.  Not to get caught up in the buzzwords, but I’m reliable, dependable, honest, both public and private. I show up to work during snow storms of any amount, and I work really well with coworkers - I'm well respected by my peers, and I have become an ""unofficial leader"" among them.  I am a team player, and I’m not there to see only myself excel. I am good with computers, and I have 20 years of really solid customer service skills that I use to make even the most unhappy customer a happy one. A lot of that comes from working in healthcare; these people are sick and have little to no guidance other than me. More of that skill comes from when I ran my company. It was only me; I did sales, cold calls, marketing, advertising, on-site repairs, workshop repairs, customer service, billing, all of the financials, and when something went wrong, I had to be there to take the hit, accept responsibility and make the situation right for the customer.  I wore all of the hats.

Even with all of the above, I feel like I still don’t know what I can offer someone, and I have no idea what industry would be mutually beneficial based upon my skill set(s).

Can someone point me in the right direction? I know that this is a very general question, but even resources where I could go to find out where I might fit in would be helpful.   For my own health, I have to step out of acute healthcare. My IT skills have waned a little bit, and I’m definitely not up on the newest and greatest. I have no certifications, not even A+ back in the day. I just knew how to talk to people, I could fix things, and keep people happy. I could work the magic, and it worked out for everyone.

I just feel really lost, and it is my own fault. I’m just looking for help.  I'm not opposed to any industry, just not acute healthcare.  My heart (and body) are no longer in it.

Thanks for your time if you read this far, I really appreciate it."
My boss has given me a month to come up with a 5 year plan. What do I do?,"Hi everyone. A little background on me to start.

I am a 24 year old woman. I never got a degree after high school due to personal reasons and instead got into retail. I worked my way up really quickly to manager, but then my mum got sick. I got an office job working inbound calls Monday to Friday (so I could visit her regularly on weekends). The company is one of the top 10 well known companies in my country. 

I have been there 9 months now and I love it. It's a company that I personally trust, it has been extremely good to me and it's the first time I feel valued. In return, I have put my hard work into it. At around 7 months I was promoted to where I am now, which is handling complaints and investigating if were liable to any damages we might cause customers. 

I had my first quality assurance review yesterday and scored pretty well. My boss confided in me that she sees a lot of potential in me and compared me to someone who started where I did and now in a senior management position. She said that if my score is the same or better next time, she wants to know where I want to be in five years and help me get there. She mentioned that the company could even put me on study leave if that's work it took. 

The problem is, I feel numb! This could be a life changing opportunity and I dont want to ruin it. I know that I was to be customer focused. I strive for customer service and i want to strive to make sure the customers are getting the best experience. 

I would love any advice on this, whether it be where I want to go, if I want to study.. I live in a very expensive city and the only reason I do is because I live with my parents. I would love to be able to move out and not struggle too much. "
Last day of work. Should I throw awful managers under the bus ?,"Hi all

Today is my last day . I’ve been with my current company for 6 years. 

Two years ago we got new managers that have been nightmares . They gossip about staff to other staff, don’t help at all, talk down to us, abuse their power and don’t know what they’re doing in general.

I got a new office job starting Monday and I used my original manager as my job reference .

At the end of my shift today I have an exit interview with HR and I’m not sure if I should just go quietly or if I should let them know that I am leaving because of the horrible new management (I’m the third person to quit just this month alone)

EDIT:
Another thing they did that irritates me ; after giving two weeks notice I used a sick day . When I went to enter it into the system my 5 sick days turned into 0. I went to HR and they said someone went into the system and deleted my sick days , HR fixed it for me. These are the kind of managers I’m dealing with so I am becoming less and less worried about burning bridges I have no desire to work in this field again 

UPDATE:

I had the meeting. It started off with some paper work and I decided I wasn’t going to say anything ... until they asked me. 

I let them know what the biggest issues were and how they could be improved. At the end of the day I don’t want to ever go back to that company/field and it’s not helping anyone if I stayed quiet. They were awful managers and I didn’t want to protect  them. "
Is it okay to quit after you pass probation ?,"Hi all

I hope you can give me a bit of guidance. I got headhunted by a recruiter 3 months ago for a accounts receivables role however the work environment is extremely toxic, I am about to pass my probation once I find a new job is it professional to leave after you pass probation.

Thanks in advance"
Certifications worth getting?,"Right now I’m a bit lost in my life I tried being a CNA I hated it. I worked at a grocery store and although I enjoyed the people the job was shit. I worked front desk at a doctors office and that was far to negative for me, and with that I don’t just mean patients my coworkers as well. I don’t feel like wasting money going to school as I have no idea what I would even major in. I’m a creative person and I like to write, design and come up with ideas. Im also info technology like phones and computers but I feel like IT just isn’t for me at the moment unless it’s hands on and has nothing to do with coding. A lot of people say I’m a very outside the box thinker as well. I’m currently looking for a way to start building my life and possible a career but I don’t know what I want to do just yet. Is there any certifications worth getting that could help start a career rather than just another job. Sorry if this didn’t give enough info of what not as this my first time posting here."
Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm fresh out of college (business law bachelor degree, top 10%) and 3 months into a big 4 company as a tax consultant and I have my first evalution interview in a few days. They are going to rate my performance and I'm supposed to give them feedback and where I see my future in the company.

&#x200B;

The thing is: I hate the job. Mostly because I discovered that I hate tax (even though I'm barely doing tax law, I'm a glorified accountant right now and I hate calculating and numbers). Partly because they lied to me at the job interview about home office and flexible working. They also won't train me because the company policy prohibits this (the seniors won't get a promotion if they train new colleagues - aka wasting time). They literally just dumped me alone in another room at the end of the building away from my colleagues the first 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for a new job since 2 months but it's tough if you are fresh out of college and working full time. So I'm thinking if I should tell them that I want into another department on another location which focuses more on actual law (preferably not tax) and with less numbers to calculate. This is super risky because I'm still on probation so they could easily fire me. So I'm not sure if I'm better off just to continue looking for another job? But not sure if I can sit through this.

&#x200B;

What should I do ?



. 


Update: I used my contacts and managed to get the contact information of our head of customs and international trade. He is willing to talk to me because they are looking for new people and this position would fit very well with my major.

So I'm calling him tomorrow. How should I handle this?"
I'm 30. I want to change career...but to what?,"I read a bunch of articles that suggested identifying my skills, what I enjoyed and not enjoyed, to help figure out what I want to do. See below. Tried a few different sectors. But I still feel clueless. 

I'm looking for suggestions on career direction. Can anyone help please?

* **Customer service/sales** \- Don't enjoy being at the front line. Worked in retail/fashion and events management, both of which I lost interest very quickly. Also worked at a healthcare clinic startup, where thankfully instead of directly selling treatments to patients, I briefly managed the sales team (interim till Sales Manager came on) and drafted the initial sales strategy (enjoy).
* **Graphic and product packaging designs** \- know the basics of Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign. Did some basic work - logos, website wireframes, print materials, photo editing, and product packaging designs for a small skincare line. Very therapeutic, but in the long run I don't have the patience to...well, echoing another redditor's comment, explain why this shade of colour is better than your grandma's choice.
* **Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable** \- I like looking at numbers once in a while. I was pretty good with Maths back in high school, though ended up pursuing a BA, so my maths is somewhat rusty. I also enjoy working with Excel, but majority of my roles only uses Excel on a beginner level - rarely requires the usage of Vlookup, pivot table, spreadsheet modelling etc.
* **Digital marketing** \- basic familiarity. Had a 3 month exposure to it a couple of years ago as an assistant. I've been reading up on how to get in, but not 100% sure I will like it. Partly because...wouldn't it be ironic to be in the field but doesn't use/have facebook, instagram etc? Further, when I had the opportunity to manage social media for a company, I wasn't motivated enough to make it happen.
* **Project management skills** \- currently pursuing a PMP certification. Based in a place where there's a very conservative, certificate-oriented hiring culture. Even if being certified in PMP isn't a requirement, I've been told that it provides some assurance for the employer (yes, I am aware that being certified doesn't translate to doing well at the job, but unfortunately many conservative employers here think certified = excel at the job)
* **Setting up/improving business processes/procedures** \- worked at a startup where process/procedures were either not in place or could be improved. What I did were relatively small-scale processes and procedures, but it was nice to be the one to set up or improve them. At another job, I also restructured the front desk operations.
* **Brand management** \- took an intro course, which I had fun with. So the concepts are there. But I don't have a huge amount of brand management experience. While I did help build the brand at the startup, my involvement was mostly in designs with some strategy planning.
* **HR -** familiar, as I was the unofficial HR assistant/manager in two of my previous roles. Not a path I want to pursue.
* **Business Strategy** \- Only had a small snippet of this in helping the startup refine the strategy and vision.

I also like researching and investigating things, and learn new softwares. I tried learning how to code, which is nice when I'm learning leisurely. But I would be terrified to code as a full-time job.

Sorry for the long read. Thanks for reading this far. Hope that I can get some help in brainstorming this."

So about 3-4 months ago, they needed to move people from one side of the warehouse to the other, to balance workflow, basically what happened is the managers picked who they would class lazy workers and gave them a letter saying they are getting moved over, this was with no notice at all, and they were given the worst shifts possible, over the weekend, plus nights since whom i work with work at night, but during the weekdays, so of course everyone was unhappy and complained, so this time around HR, wanted to be more fair about it, they gave us more notice and a chance to volunteer to move over to the other side of the building, where we also get to pick three different shifts we would like most out of all the available shifts. they needed 60 people in total out of our side of the warehouse from every shift, the rule also was, if not enough people volunteered, they will pick the people who most recently got a Blue badged  (moved from agency and hired by amazon), and So if this was true, I would be on the list to get moved, so the smartest thing to do is to volunteer, and secure a Good shift and not get stuck with a bad one, So in the meeting we sit with our Senior Manager, before we wait for the last person to arrive, we just have general chats before he explains the process and asks if anyone wants to go, In this meeting the important thing i noted is when he said, They wouldn't force you to go from a Night Shift to a Day shift since you are used to your money you get weekly, its about £40 higher, it adds up, and since we all get over worked, no one would wanna get paid less. So with that it gave me more confidence that volunteering would be the best thing in my shoes to do, And I do, so the next week comes, I get my letter and I see that they put me on a Day shift but even worse Mid day, so you work from 12 to 12 at night, with the Day pay lol, now we all at amazon love to gossip and complain to each other, so i find out from my Manager that this Girl is leaving to the other side of the building and I'd be good for her job, she got to sit down xD so i was Like YESSS< but then i was like shit i volunteered to go too, he was like you weren't on the list to go, which just got me mad, since HR lied Senior management lied, They clearly got to pick again who could stay and go, they picked me since I'm not lazy, well I am but they don't catch me, and another point is, this other girl who Got her blue badge way way before anyone and should of been safe, got forced to go, and She got the shift I picked as my first Option, which makes the whole volunteer system bullshit and meaningless in the first place. so of course I go to explain to my manager and he tells me to write a letter, to someone i haven't herd of, or ever seen, in the building. i just want some advise on how I put a letter together, since clearly from this mess Im not much of a writer. 

&#x200B;

I know that if i send a letter to the write person in the building something could be done, for someone in my shoes its not much of a big deal, i can still get to work, the £40 less isn't a huge deal, but what if i didn't have a car, or access to work at that time, or really need the extra £40, people who were forced to move over again, are in those situations, maybe exposing their whole process of moving people was a shit show again, maybe they can do it fucking properly.

"Received job offer from 2nd choice, how and when do I tell 1st choice? We already have a second interview scheduled","I'm nearing the end of my job search phase with 2 leads (1st and 2nd choice). Yesterday I had an interview with 1st choice that went well and was called back today for a second interview on Tuesday at 4pm. 

I also received a job offer today from 2nd choice which I had to ask for an extension from the coming Monday to Friday to make a decision (+4 days). She was very accommodating and spoke to the manager on that... and asked about my situation which I only revealed ""it's a different type of position and I want to make a thorough decision... should hear back next week."" 

What I really need advice on is **how do I tell 1st choice that I need an answer before Friday?** We literally just spoke today. Should I email the recruiter ASAP or mention it at the interview on Tuesday? and how do I word this conversation / email?!

It's my first time posting and encountering this so I really appreciate all answers! If more detail is needed, happy to provide. "
"new job lied about working from home and is now at location, any advice?","I took new job to get out of a bad work situation and happy to either work on location or from home which is common in my field esp since I dont work with a team-- I was open. 

I accepted the job, I was told several times I was going to be a wfh employee from HR and have emails to show from HR saying this and docs they had me fill out for working at home and criteria for internet etc, that they canceled scheduled orientation date since I was remote.

The background check due to an error on their end took 2mths. Since knowing once background clears I will be remote job I decide to move in with fiance who works further away and this was the perfect chance with having the time before start. I set up new home office and picked out place with extra bedroom for office.

Boss now tells me this isn't the case. I addressed this clearly what I was told and how I was moving based on this info but I am being told that was a mistake and need to be in office everyday and can't even have one day - didn't matter what HR said.

I am stuck with a far commute that I didn't sign up for. I asked recruiter in interview what the hours are, he responded 9-5 now I am told 8-5. I wouldnt mind at all if was told upfront but now that I have a longer commute with a longer work day. I've had long commutes in past and really worked hard to avoid this by asking questions. 

I am discouraged from this horrible onboarding exp. I am not sure what I should do. I feel lied to. Its hard to take time off in the start of a new job to interview. Since I already discussed and was shot down not sure what more to do without looking bad myself. Leaving a job so early in does not look good but I really did not expect this. 

If you have any advice on how to handle this, it's great appreciated. Thanks!"
How do you distinguish between a dream and a career that suits you?,"Throw away account.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for replying! I'm using Reddit minimally so I will get back to all of you soon.

I'm 30 year-old male and my career background is teaching English as a second language. I dropped everything and ""learned to code"" two years ago and am calling it quits to go back and teach English in Korea again. My fiancée is there and we thought if we broke into the tech industry it would be the best option for us. We each took bootcamps in our respective countries. She got a job as a web publisher! Unfortunately for me, I couldn't find *any* decent job in America with my previous work experience (barista, ESL teacher, events coordinator, and psych BA) or even by having attended a coding bootcamp. So she won't be immigrating here because we essentially wouldn't be able to live on my shitty salary. My relatives think I'm too impulsive and scattered with my ideas, but I think it's better to know when to quit. This endeavor has drained me and I don't even *like* what I started.

I still want a Masters Degree so my inability to find a job doesn't perpetuate, just not in computer science. Everything I think I want to be seems suspiciously idealistic, like I'm starry-eyed as I was for coding. I can't imagine who I want to be, but I want to be something. I took a career aptitude test and it had some very *cool* recommendations (diplomate, lawyer, judge, archeologist) but I can't see myself doing any of that.

Do people in those professions intuitively know that's the career they want in a sudden moment, a calling when when they hear the word, or do they stumble into it after lots of rumination?

Obviously, you can't just stumble into a law firm, but I feel like if I don't have a riveting call, a real competitive want *now*, then it's something I shouldn't start. But also, how would I know if I've never tried? The world is just so competitive that any direction I take will be challenging, that doesn't phase me, I just want to make sure I love it. In the meantime I'm grasping at straws like finding out I'm an ENFJ and taking aptitude tests.

I've always wanted to work for an organization like Amnesty International. What draws me to a position within AI is dealing with multiple diverse cultures and social justice. In my adolescence I wanted to be a preacher but I left the religion finding out I am an agnostic pantheist & atheist. When I was young, I dreamed of being outspoken like Tupac because of the positive changes he wanted to implement. Most recently, seeing Bernie Sanders run for office was inspiring, and I looked at running for a local district seat but am holding off because I want more professional experience and need to establish myself. In short, In my future career I need to somehow be benefiting people.

It's wildly frustrating because my family thinks me being stuck is because of my lack of religion. My mother is the only person who isn't pushing me to continue to code because she knows it's not something she'd see me doing in the first place.

How do I narrow down my career choices? How do distinguish between my dreams and actual talent? Or at least, how do I know I'll love something enough to keep pursuing it? I also feel absolutely spoiled because I'm 30 and have no real responsibility. Both of my grandparents were successful entrepreneurs and here I am living with mommy and daddy struggling to decide what *I* *want*. I feel like I have no right to complain, but by having privilege is more the reason I should find something that's great for me."

"About to quit my current job as I'm on the cusp of getting fired, but I started/am in the middle of A LOT of personal development. Advice on career shifting and development?","Hey Y'all,

&#x200B;

I'm a recent college graduate (May 2018) and 24 M, still figuring out my life. Per my other posts in different subs, I've been depressed at work. For the past few weeks, I've been royally dropping the ball at my current hotel night audit position, but it's mostly been a result of my bad attitude and mental state. I've moved from the east coast to out west for this job, and the night audit schedule/1 hour (6 nights weekly, 11-7:30) commute has also broken me down. Basically my negative attitude has been self-sabotaging to the point where I don't  learn or retain new information, and I've consistently failed to comply with proper practices, which should have gotten me fired by now but thankfully, I haven't been written up or fired. Aside from that, I have had communication issues, have not been diligent in my work, and have made accounting mistakes that should have gotten me fired, but most of all, I felt unhappy and unsatisfied with everything. I took all of my mistakes to heart, but didn't effectively solve them. It's all self-sabotage, and I feel like I'm beginning the arc into a successful adulthood! My mistakes have been documented and I don't think that I can get a job with this (major) hotel chain anymore, or at least for awhile, but I'm also happy that my boss has called me out on my BS and it has prompted me to really change my life for the better. My questions:

&#x200B;

How can I explain all of that to a new employer without sounding like an incompetent? I'm already applying for new jobs and about to give my 2 week notice for this hotel since I cannot work at nights anymore for my sanity and mental health. 

How can I promote myself effectively? I just realized all of these destructive behaviors in the last 2 weeks, so it's been a tremendous time for me personally. I haven't solved them all yet, but I'm on the path now and don't want to stop. 

Have any of y'all been in the same situation? What did you guys do to solve it? 

&#x200B;

Thanks! I really want this to be my year and grind for a new outlook on life and new health state by my next birthday."
Can't Do Business Professional Dress for Interview -> Automatic Disqualification?,"So I was contacted this morning to set up a meeting with the hiring manager of a local marketing consulting firm to discuss an entry level position. In a confirmation email, they asked that I come dressed business professional, which I take to mean a suit. The problem is that I don't own one. Since the interview is tomorrow at 9:45 am and my current job is second shift, I will have no time to get one. The firm is also a 90 minute drive for me, so I won't have time to grab anything tomorrow morning. 

So I guess I have two options. 1) Go as is and hope for the best or 2) ask to reschedule the interview ASAP to give me time to find something. I'm 29 and have never worked in marketing. I can do the nice end of business casual. What should I do? Would they disqualify me based on this?"
"Started a new job 5 months ago and want to work from home, how do I approach my boss?","I got hired at a position that is very niche and they were taking candidates as either in person or telecommute. It’s a very work from home friendly environment. Instead of bargaining for more money, I bargained to work from home. The recruiter talked with my boss who told her that I can work from home after a year (did not get this in writing)

My boss is retiring this summer and I want to solidify working from home 3 days a week. Not full time bc I would go nuts but it would save me a huge commute (can be an hour each way)

I have a review on Monday, should I broach the subject then? If so, how should I approach it? I really like the job but want to wfh more often. Thanks for advice "
Best place to look for jobs?,"I've been interviewing lately with companies I found on Indeed, and they're all generally trash. Did anyone ever get a good job from a job site? My highest-paying gig came from a recruiter but they haven't been calling me as much lately."
Is it okay to have different versions of your CV that highlight different work experience?,"I have 13 years of nonprofit experience, mostly in comms/project management, with a lot of adjunct experience in partnerships and digital marketing/social media. I'm applying to a social impact organization that has a few positions open. The one I'd really like to interview for is a strategic partnerships role (a bit of a reach as this hasn't been my direct focus, but I certainly have enough experience to make a case for applying), but there is also a social media manager position I am qualified for. Since I am sort of an outreach/marketing/comms generalist, I can tweak my CV to go a bunch of different directions depending on what I want to highlight (can't say it all!).

I have a contact in the org I'd like to shoot an email to and tell about my interest in these two roles. Is it okay to provide two versions of my CV for the two different positions or is that looked down upon?"

"I'm a 48-year-old mom of 3 looking at a second career. I made the wrong decisions once, how do I make sure I don't mess up again?","I'm 48, have 3 kids (2 grown and 1 teen), and am a foster mom for abused infants. I've been a nurse for the past 27 years and I'm done. I'm finally at a point in life where I don't have to work at a job I hate and I can do something I love. I'm having a hard time deciding on what to do though. I am torn between two life-long loves and afraid to make the wrong decision. 

 I've wanted to be a grade school art teacher since I was a kid, but I'm not talented when it comes to fine arts (drawing, painting, etc..). I would, of course, go back to school for art and teaching; getting my degree in art education. Do you think it's possible to learn artistic skills and be an art teacher without natural artistic ability? Do you think 50 or 51 is too old to start a teaching career?

My other love is babies and supporting and educating at risk families. I was a teen mom, with no mom of my own. I know how hard and scary that is. I don't know what job THAT job is though. I want to take care of babies and help at-risk families. I want to do hands-on care, but not like daycare. I would go back to school for this as well and major in child development- but I have no idea what this job is. 

How do you decide what you want to be when you grow up? I'm so afraid of making the wrong choice. I made a hasty decision when I was young and did what was quick and would make enough money to pay bills. I was stuck in that career for 27 years. Now I get a ""do-over"" and I'm fearful of making the wrong decision again."
"Do I actually hate my job, or does everybody feel this way?","Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile!

I’m an engineer working for a consumer products company. This is my first job out of college, I’ve been here for 2 years.

On paper, I feel like I should love my job. I make great money, have a lot of autonomy to take on and lead many different types of projects, work reasonable hours, and live in a decent mid-sized city. My work is low stress and has a lot of flexibility, my current boss is a little absent but otherwise we get along fine.

This all said, the reality is that I find myself DREADING work every single day. I can’t make myself care about my projects anymore, which is shocking from somebody who has been an ambitious workaholic their entire life. I end up crying in the bathroom an embarrassing amount. I feel like I’m losing my drive by the day.

To try to articulate what I don’t like in my job:
- I love working on teams, closely with people. The culture of my group doesn’t facilitate this, we work very isolated from each other.
- I don’t care about the final products I work on. I always envisioned myself “making a difference in the world”, and it’s hard to see how that’s true in CPG.
- I don’t feel challenged like I did in undergrad, much of my work is paper pushing or hunting down other people to make sure their work is getting done.

However, these are all normal complaints! None of these should be reasons to feel as miserable as I am! Right??! Or maybe they are?

So, Reddit, I’m looking to hear how others feel about their work / felt about their first jobs. I’m starting to look for a new role within the company, but hesitant to start looking for positions externally quite yet because I’m stuck wondering: is the grass just greener on the outside? Is this simply what work feels like for everyone, and I need to suck it up and appreciate what I have?

Thanks in advance for any inputs!"
I recently made a choice that completely ruined my career. Has anyone else done this?,I changed jobs to do something that would be better for my family but the new role didn’t work out and now I’ve been unemployed for 5 mos and in total panic and such regret. Anyone else have a similar story?
How do I give my 2 week notice?,"I started my current job about 5 months ago. While I don’t like the job, the people are wonderful and it’s tearing me up thinking about leaving them. However, I got the opportunity for a once in a lifetime 3 month tour of Europe and I can’t pass it up. What is the best thing to say in this situation when I give my 2 weeks to keep a positive relationship and let me know I appreciate everything they’ve taught me over the last 5 months. I’ve asked the people around me and have received many different answers (ex. Overly honest, lie, don’t give notice)."
Should I Report My Manager?,"I’ve been working on a small HR team with this particular manager for the last 9 months or so. My coworkers have recently confided in me their issues with our manager (on top of my own grievances) which include:

- Comments he frequently makes towards female direct reports, like “Why aren’t you smiling?”. I’m the only other male on the team, never get comments like that.

- He chronically steals company time. He disappears for 2-4 hours a day every day. Does not let us know where he’s been and is unreachable during these times. He does not log these hours as time off (part of my job is to track this for all employees).

- He will take vacation days or work remotely last minute, letting us know the morning of. 

- Is chronically unavailable and hard to find in the office - causes our work/projects to grind to halt without any supervision.

- I cannot speak to his personal life, but he has drank heavily at at least two company events and driven drunk. On one such occasion when he was drunk, he offered me a ride home. I declined.

- I recently got diagnosed with a serious medical issue that caused chronic migraines. My manager took me aside and criticized me for not working fast enough despite knowing full well of my condition. Essentially sent the message that if I can’t work fast enough, I should just take a sick day.

- Everyone on our team did not provide critical feedback of him during his annual review for fear of reprisals. He is the type to hold a grudge. 

My other coworkers are more junior (first jobs out of college) and fear they will lose their jobs if they report him. I’m in a more senior role, and very upset at his management style and his hurtful reaction to and handling of my unexpected medical condition.

Should I report him to HR upper management? I fear for my job as well, since we are a small team I imagine he’ll figure out who actually reported him. 

I don’t want to ruin someone’s life by getting them fired. But I also fear that he will just get a slap on the wrist and then make our lives harder for the foreseeable future. 

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: since it seems unclear to most people, I work in HR, and part of my job is maintaining HR software systems. So when I say my manager is stealing time, it is in fact (1) my job and (2) in my pay grade to track and know if people are stealing time and money from the company. And since I’ve worked there (less than a year) I have witnessed him steal 25+ days of time from the company."
Should I consider a a job offer 1 month in to my current job?,"A couple months ago I was working for a company as a freelancer, I knew my time there was not guaranteed, so I interviewed with other companies. One day, I got an email with a job offer, the same day the boss at my then current place of work, invited me into his office. He had also offered me a position to work for him. 2 offers in one day, sweet! In the end I decided to accept the offer from the new company. Fast forward 2 months, I am one month into my current job. Today I got an email from my old boss, inviting me in and that he has a new opportunity he thinks I would be perfect for and that he is willing to make an interesting offer for me. So should I at least see what he has to say? I don't think that would hurt anything, but what do you guys think? Has anything ever happened to you like this?"
How do you think well on your feet and respond to unexpected questions during meetings?,"I always have difficulty participating in meetings because I don’t have time to think through my response, especially when it comes to complex ideas. I always fumble at stringing complex thoughts and articulating them verbally.


I ended up rambling, or say something incoherent that no one understands. After time, i ended up listening passively don’t participate, or just say that I needed time to think through, which doesn’t work all the time.


I don’t have any issues if I prepped beforehand though, I could jot down points and speak while referring to the notes.

In the long run, this isn’t good for my professional image.

Any ideas on how to overcome this?

EDIT: This applies to the questions I ask during meetings too - sometimes they were phrased so badly, no one knew what I was trying to ask."
GM position at 19???,"Hey everyone.
I'm a soon to be college grad, turning 20 soon. I've been working at this bagel bakery that I love dearly for the past year or so. I moved quickly from cashier, to line cook, to manager and then to baker. I've been given a lot of responsibility with some of the specials and stuff like that. 

Anyway my general manager is leaving soon, and she told me she'd like to train me as her replacement. This means I'd be getting a salary right out of college. 

This is a lot for me, since I went to art school for photography. I still want to pursue that, but baking is another love of mine and I feel like I can do both at once.

How to get job experience when all jobs require experience?,"I recently decided to switch career fields and I keep hitting this roadblock. Every job I want to apply for requires 2-5 years of experience. The companies that don't have this requirement either aren't posting the types of jobs I'm looking for or can't pay me enough for me to bother switching.

Some personal background information: I'm a military veteran with 4 years of experience doing analytical research and maintaining databases. I have a degree in English with 6 years of editing and 10 years of technical writing experience. Last year I went back to school to get my MBA and I graduate in the spring. 

This summer I attempted to get a slew of different internships ranging from PR to marketing to consulting and someone with more experience got picked every single time (isn't the point of an internship to actually get that experience!?).

So now how am I supposed to find a job in 6 months when I don't have any concrete experience (and couldn't even land an internship) in the positions I would like to do but have all types of skills, degrees, certifications, and other types of experience?"

"BA in Philosophy, ~5 years work experience at law firm accounting dept., what next?","Feeling stuck/uninspired, currently making \~60k as a Legal Biller in a Law Firm (sort of like Accounts Receivable specialist, but I work with ebilling programs a lot). There's no ladder to climb and you're either a biller or the supervisor years down the line. I'm not sure how I can ever start making ""house and family"" type money living here in Chicago with this job.

I was always a good student, 3.9 GPA graduating DePaul University with a BA in Philosophy, but I have a pretty big motivation/lack of passion issue. The only thing that seems to really interest me in life is physical fitness/health, and even though I'm dedicated and have built a good body, I'm still a smaller dude and along with injuries, I don't think I can make a career out of that passion. 

Is there any good options to maybe get a Masters in something, or just switch job fields to something that fits my experience? I'm down for any ideas. I know law school sort of fits, but since I have no debt currently, I don't relish the idea of putting my self 100k+ in debt to enter an over-saturated job field where it seems new associates have to sign their life away to ridiculous hours at a corporate firm, or choose to take a job that doesn't pay much more than what I'm currently making lol. It would definitely tap into my lack of motivation issue, since once of my biggest fears is feeling like I'm wasting effort. My job probably doesn't need to be fulfilling, I'm very comfortable with my life outside of work, almost too much so because it makes me shy away from longs hours working etc."

"I got a raise and promotion, but it feels like a pay cut...Can you get a raise to a lower FTE salary than you had the previous year?","Hi all. So I got a raise and promotion today but I’m not excited at all about it. 

The promotion is easy. New title more responsibility. Cool.

The raise though feels like a pay cut. So last year my yearly salary was raised to $55k in June, which makes some of the math complicated. Apparently I was to make $52000 for the year, Counting the mid year raise. 

However, I had a family emergency and needed to take some unpaid leave, so I went down to 30 hours a week for a few months. I ended up making $50k in total at the end of the year (counting unpaid leave).

Fast forward to today. I get my promotion and a “raise” to $53500 a year. Apparently the got my 2018 salary from HR and gave me a 5% raise off of what I make last year. So my full time 2019 salary was counted off my reduced unpaid family leave salary of 2018. 

This makes no sense. Is this how raises work? All things equal I think the raise should have been based on my FTE salary, not the FMLA one? Because working full time this year I’m making less than last year? That and now I have a lot more responsibility. How to I talk to my company about this? I hate confrontation but this doesn’t seem right.

Tl;dr: made $55k, had to take unpaid leave, actually made $50k, got raise based on that."
Which Career is Less Stressful: Accounting or Programming?,"I've been deciding between Accounting and Programming. I just want to make sure I make the right choice based on my personality type. I'm a high anxiety person so its important that I choose a career I can handle well.

I've done some very basic skimming of both fields on the internet just to get a taste of what it's like. I don't know Jack, so I could be completely wrong about what I'm about to say below

Accounting looks good to me because it appears to have a stable workflow. It seems like kind of job that you can just sit down and get to right away. And it seems like a job that is more mechanical and streamlined (less mentally taxing and less likely to make your head blow up). A job that you can digest easily in small incremental portions. 

Programming looks interesting but I heard its for those problem-solver type people. The kind who like puzzles and brain games. That's not me at all. I never had an interest in puzzles as a kid and I still don't. It also seems like the kind of job where you frequently run into problems and lose your head over it. So that's a negative side for me. 

On the other hand, the idea of creating something from scratch (a program) is fascinating to me. I am a creative person at heart. Just not sure if I'll enjoy the act of programming because I never really did it personally so I don't know what it's like.

Which of these careers is less stressful? And which of them has a more flexible working schedule? I'm considering private accounting btw (which I hear is less stressful than public accounting)

A flexible work schedule is important to me. I've heard that a lot of programmers work on their laptops and choose to work whenever and wherever as long as they finish the work by the deadline. Is this true?

"Hairstylists of Reddit, do you enjoy your career?","I’ve always had a passion for beauty but have been scared to pursue it because it’s scary not knowing if I would actually be good at it and not make decent money. I’m almost 29 and so sick of the type of jobs I’ve had. I have a cleaning business that makes decent money but I don’t like the work. I’ve also worked as a leasing agent and done other office work which is soul crushing! I’m thinking it’s time to just bite the bullet and enroll into school or else I’ll always look back and think “what if”. And no, I don’t think of it as the easy way out. I know it’s hard to build etc. I’m just scared of the unknown :/

So my questions are:

1. How long did it take you to build a solid clientele?
2. Is reaching at least $50k profit possible? I’m in Roseville California. Lots of nice high end salons in my area. 
3. Did you start renting right away or assist?
4. Are most clients talkative? 
5. I have some social anxiety, will this career eat me alive because of this?
6. Are other stylist friendly and helpful or are they catty? 
7. What are your hours like? Like do you have to work from 9am - 9pm? Is having Sunday and Monday possible? 
8. Are you happy with your career choice?

Thanks for any advice! I appreciate it :3"
What Are The Benefits of Salary vs Hourly?,"I have two offers I'm considering for my first ""real"" job after college. One is hourly, the other salary, but they're very close in terms of compensation.

Can I get some advice on the advantages and disadvantages of both?

One of my main concerns is what happens when I'm out sick. If I'm salaried and get sick, can employers dock pay if I don't have sick time built up? "
I'm almost 40 years old and have no degree. Can you help with direction and degree recommendations?," I am a person who is 40 years old with no degree and I am concerned about job security and the next 25 years of work.  
 

In my teenage years I took vocational and career classes.  I started  college but had to work instead.  I have worked my way up the past 23  years as a draftsman, a cad modeller, a tool maker, a designer and now  an engineering manager for the aerospace industry.  Most of what I do  now is Solidworks design.  I have experience in mechanical, electrical,  hydraulics, pneumatic systems and many various software systems.  I  design turn-key packages that include all of these elements.

I also do  some light programming in PLC, VBA and have previous experience with  HTML, PHP, Pearl, SQL.  I love computers and tech.  Building and repairing  PC's has been a hobby since I had a Tandy 6mhz.   I also build stuff.  Book  cases, picnic tables, bathrooms, kitchens, full size decks... doesn't  matta.  I can calc some hydraulic forces for you and spec cylinders and fittings, or drop you a new stainless dual tub with sprayer and disposal in a few hours.  
 

I can obviously tell that times have changed.  
 

Upset about the election results, my own employer has started a crusade  against ""uneducated"" people.   He also changed my title to strike the  word ""Engineering"" from it and replace it with ""Design"" as that doesn't  imply ""Fake engineer"".  It does not seem to matter that I have designed  millions of dollars of product for him, having completed close to a  thousand designs over the last 20 years.   I am still paid very well  regardless.  As acting Design Manager I do manage actual engineers with  actual degrees (is this all sounding crazy?) and I TEACH them our  industry.  
 

Anyhow.  It appears I need some papers to support the idea that I'm not  stupid.   The worst part of it is when I tell anyone how I make a  living, the very first comment is ""Where did you go to school?"" and I  sheepishly have to explain that I'm technically uneducated.  
 

I'm also concerned that if I needed a new job in the next 20 years I may  not be hired because I do not have a degree.  I have a stunning amount  in 401K, investments as a safety net.  I currently have 2 houses, one of  which I rent, and 4 income streams.  Therefore I feel that I do not  need the king of degrees, I just need groundwork to be considered by  companies.  I feel by 2030 no one will be allowed to WORK without a  degree, as even being a secretary now requires a degree >.<  
 

I am not sure if I want a degree in mech or aerospace.  With the second  half of my life, I may want to focus more on computer systems, or  perhaps focus on management.  But I need a direction to get started.   I  was also looking at the online schooling, as I work 10 hour days and  have a family.  If I could start with an associates that could later be  used toward various bachelors that would be very helpful.  I really do  not know a lot about the education process itself.  
 

I was also thinking I could add certs and licenses too, in various trade  skills.  I could also get a cert for Solidworks Certified Professional  and whatnot pretty easily, but never thought that would actually ""mean""  something on a resume.  
 

Any posts appreciated.  Sorry this was long winded"

New employer left me hanging a day before start date. They admitted fault. I'm left hanging and jobless. What are my options?,"I had made a post on this previously but didn't get much traction.  Basically, I was hired for a position that requires government security clearance.  All prerequisites completed and both HR and new supervisor said I was good to start work.  The Sunday before start date they found someone had dropped the ball on some records changes.  2 days later i'm told it can't be resolved and to look for another job.  Both boss and HR admitted fault.  This is in Ohio (at will state).  I don't think I can get unemployment because I resigned from my previous employer.  Do I have any rights here?

My CEO changed my job entirely in one day and now requires me to be out of town 2 weeks of the month. I'm a single mother and need advice. Can he do this?,"I have been with a start up type company for 3 years. It's kind of confusing because I have been working in the same position but serving 2 of their sister companies as well. My boss told me that the companies split my salary.
About a year ago - my paycheck source changed. Over the course of 3 years, the name of the parent company paying me has changed 3 times.
And a few months ago, one of those companies (that I helped get on the INC 5000)list laid everyone off. The CEO of that company did it from his private jet on his way to a luxurious vacation and posted about it on Facebook. No one was happy.
My CEO has always been pretty fair imo. But, it's been very strange trying to understand all the moving parts.
Last Friday he told me that I am moving exclusively to the OTHER company and I will most likely be required to travel 2weeks of every month. TWO WEEKS.
I am a mom and I honestly don't know how I'm going to do this. I make 6 figures and this is very, very important income. But, I am very concerned.
4 hours after this happened....at 10pm on Friday night -- my NEW CEO emailed and asked for changes to be made to an existing project I completed months ago. He wanted it ASAP. I couldn't get in touch with the editor, so I told him I would do my best.
He told me to call him after 1pm on Saturday to discuss my new role and projects -- I called twice. Left messages and he never returned them. Instead, he was posting on Facebook that he wanted to ""meet up for dinner with cool interesting fun people -- that he had a 6pm reservation...and asked top networkers to meet him.
So he does weird things.... and he doesn't even respond to me.
I am very concerned about my status. Can a CEO change your job description so radically (mandate travel 2 weeks out of the month)... and get away with it? Do I have any recourse?

If I say no -- I guess I'll be fired?"
How much credibility do employee reviews have on websites like Glassdoor or Indeed?,Looking for a new job and as part of my due diligence I’ve been reading up on the employee reviews of the companies I’m applying to and they seem pretty polarizing for the most part.

Should I give up on finding a job that I enjoy?,"20/yo Web Developer here. I worked hard to set myself up for a productive career as a programmer and I'm on a steady path for it – unfortunately, it it makes me miserable.

I've worked jobs that are enjoyable but not fulfilling, my brother is a scientist who would describe what he does as fulfilling but not enjoyable, and I'm currently working a job that is neither but pays well. I'm already feeling like resigning to the ""suffer in quiet desperation"" life path.

What I want to know is: does anybody here find their job to be both enjoyable and fulfilling? Does anybody feel that their work tangibly affects the world? Am I just part of a spoiled generation, and that's why I think I'm supposed to enjoy my job and make a positive difference in the world?"
Is it time for me to move on if acquiring a Masters isn't a valid reason to request a pay increase?,"This is a throwaway, family knows my actual account and I'm kind of embarrassed asking about this.

&#x200B;

I took a known pay cut going to work for this University, it's a top-rated school in the US and rationalized the pay cut with the benefit of free school. Three years in I've acquired my Masters (Electrical Engineering) and approached my boss for what can be done about increasing my compensation to reflect my new skill-set/work I've been doing. I'm currently enrolled in a PhD program for the school, Masters was just a little victory, but I'm not making much more than when I started. Boss told me it's an HR issue, he can do what he can but in the end it comes to their decision and they have a bad history with not crediting their own institution's degrees as a valid reason for pay increase.

&#x200B;

I want to continue for the PhD but I found out one of the employees we just hired with not much more than a Masters is making significantly more than me. To make it worse he's working under me as I've started to work point on most of the work I'm involved in. I'm at least another two years from finishing my PhD but given the fact I'm making close to 3x less my current market value I'm finding it hard to stay versus finding a new place and juggling a more demanding workplace with remaining schoolwork/research.

&#x200B;

Honestly, I'm just at a loss for what I should do. I want to talk to HR or someone involved in the process but I don't even know where to begin.

Edit for clarification:

This position is a full time staff position at a University, not a TA or RA position. If I was in an RA/TA position the Masters would have increased the stipend amount due to the increase in education level."
How do I tell potential employer I quit my last job in a professional way?,"Hey all, I have an interview coming up and I know they are going to ask me why I left my last job. I'm trying to figure out how to be professional about it. In short, my values were no longer in alignment with theirs. While that sentence is short, it also says a lot.  I'm just worried that I'm choosing the wrong words. The second worry is that I don't want to use my last boss as a reference (because of the reasons I quit) and so I am worried about how that will look. I do have other references and one will be a coworker as professional and character reference as we worked side by side and she knows more of the work I did and produced than my boss did. Any tips or suggestions? Thanks for reading."
What do I say when asked in an interview “What about this job interests you?” when the only reason I want the job is because I will be getting paid?,I’ve come to the conclusion that I am not passionate about anything that would make me money and I’m totally happy with just getting any job out of college that pays me relatively what my degree should be getting me. So when in an interview and they ask me what I find intriguing about this job (one example is IT Audit) what do I say to that?
How do you turn down a promotion?,"For background, I have a masters in counseling, am a published author of 4 research studies in professional journals, I have more than 15 years of experience in mental health, most of which are as a therapist. Several times throughout my career, I was on the path to licensure and invariably, my job responsibilities would change (eg: management) and the offer to support it would be forgotten (and unnecessary for the new responsibilities). 

Recently, my position of a year as a therapist became team leader and came again with the promise of having someone at my workplace (who was qualified) supervise me so that I accumulate the hours for licensure. Again, it fell through and I’m not willing or interested in licensure. In my field, it means little in terms of money and a significant amount of additional work. I’ve tried to get out of this field for years but have resigned myself to sitting right where I am, with flexibility, freedom and time to work on side jobs (eg: freelance writing). I Meade $39k a year and was already told that with licensure, they would increase that $500. No thanks.

Sorry this is long. Anyway, my supervisor is now dangling another carrot, telling me that they intend to make me a manager in the near future. I guess if I were at the beginning of my career it might be enticing but I can’t think of anything I’d rather do less. I’m a great worker, fantastic documentarian, supportive and encouraging of my staff and willing to work above and beyond 40 hours every week (I’m salaried, so it’s irrelevant). Bottom line is I don’t want the position, at all. I also don’t want to lose the position I have, so I don’t want to insult the offer. I’m as busy as I want to be and they already get a bargain in the quality of my work. We get health insurance and no vision or dental or retirement. They haven’t in 30+ years and have no intention to do so, so we have to purchase/invest on our own. 

How do I turn down a management position without insulting the organization? I’d love to tell them the true reasons why I don’t want it but I won’t. What would you say?"

How can I make better contributions during meetings?,"Does anyone have any suggestions for how to improve my contributions during meetings? I'm a developer, and I find that when we have team meetings my colleagues always have interesting thoughts, and opinions that they share. For me, I am generally quiet in the meetings, and often feel uncomfortable when asked directly for my opinion.

I'm starting a new job next week and I want to really focus of this issue as I think if I get stuck into the habit of being quiet again it'll be difficult to change afterwards. On the other hand, I'll be working with a new code base etc, and may not necessarily have a lot of info to make great contributions. 

I should say I work in an office that doesn't use my first language, which is clearly part of the issue, but I don't think it explains everything.

Looking forward to hearing suggestions!"
Which salary estimation site should I trust/cite when determining salary requirements?,"Hey internet! 

So I’m trying to figure out how much I should actually be getting paid. Surprise. I’ve been in my field nearly ten years and have had “superior performance” at every job — except probably my current one, but that’s a different story. 

Context: I’ve been interviewing with a few new companies and have gotten mixed reviews on salary range. I told one company (role reporting to CEO) my minimum was $60k and they said that was too much. For another job (reporting to VP), I told them $60k and the recruiter told me “I’m putting down $70k-$75k — that’s what you should be asking for.” They’re both in similar industries — the second one is arguably less responsibility, so what gives?

I’m interviewing with a third company that I really, really like so far, but salary hasn’t come up yet. This is another reporting to CEO job, same industry (SaaS dev). The recruiter already spilled the beans that she thinks I’m perfect, so I’m pretty confident I’ll make it to the next round. 

The problem: I have no clue what to ask for in terms of salary! The last two interviews have totally thrown me for a loop with their $20k difference. Doing salary research, it seems every single salary site puts me in the $55k-$60k range, but salary.com puts me at $80k-$88k. 

Which do I trust? Do I risk losing a possibly amazing opportunity (if offered) because I asked for too much? Or do I undersell myself and hope for another crazy recruiter to tell me “oh no, here’s an extra $15k”?

My location has had a surge in tech which has been increasing some salaries — I’ve seen recs for engineers offering Bay Area salaries. I know I’m worth more than the average person in my field — but I was (underpaid, admittedly) making $75k in the Bay Area last year and now that I’m in a lower COL, I’m just... confused. Help?"
How can I supplement my skills to become a data analyst?,"So I worked as a “data analyst” for 2 years in IT Security but all I did was track metrics and pull data when other people couldn’t figure out how. I wouldn’t consider it actual analysis. I then got a job in retail analytics which had been my goal but it was at a startup and they had financial trouble so I was let go after only 3 months.

I want to continue doing retail analytics or customer analytics or product analytics, but I have 0 domain knowledge. I have some of the technical skills required (python, sql, excel, statistics) but no experience in the industry.

I noticed lots of postings ask for Business Analyst experience. Would it be worthwhile to get a certificate in Business Analysis? This would not be a degree or anything, it’s a continuing education certificate offered by my school. Would employers think a certificate is useful or would it be a waste of money?

I haven’t seen any courses that focus on retail analysis so I don’t know how to get experience in it since no one will hire me without experience. What kind of courses should I look for? Would they be under marketing or sociology or something? Are their courses that would teach me about Product analysis?

Any advice is appreciated."
What part-time jobs can house and feed a single adult?,"For various health reasons it's looking like working 40 hours a week is going to be unrealistic for me.

By some miracle I was able to earn an associate degree in computer science, but I haven't been able to advance much beyond that.

I've been trying to slowly study the rest of my way towards a job in programming, but it looks like freelancing (my best shot at part-time programming work) is extremely difficult to get into if you don't have prior experience.

What other options are out there?"
People doing what you love: how did you get to a place where you're doing what you love?,"The older I get, and the more days go on, I realize, I just want to be doing something I love. This is so simple, yet seems so complicated (I mean, with life).

To all the people out there who feel purpose, motivation, and anticipation every day that they work, socialize, and otherwise live - what is your advice for how you got into a space where life mostly consisted of just doing stuff that you love?"
Am I going to get laughed out of the room if I ask for $10k over the stated salary for an entry-level position if I have a lot of really valuable experience?,"The vitals:

-B.S. in environmental science
-5 years in digital/technical marketing
-Pursuing an environmental technical writing position for a big firm at the entry level because I want to get out of marketing and into more sciencey stuff 
-Located in Hawaii where the cost of living is high.  

 I have a firm that wants to hire me.  Though they consider it entry level, the job sounds high stress and skilled.  The interviewer agreed.  It is with a great company with tons of room for growth.  They are looking for someone in the 40k range.  

Entry level tech writers with 0 experience apparently have a median salary in the 52k range in this region.  Also, it's a hard truth that anything below $55k is extremely difficult to live on in this area.

I really want to get my foot in the door with this company, but I dont want to lose the opportunity by asking for too much money.

I am the typical self deprecating millenial who has always been underpaid because I chose underpaid work over no work in the beginning.  Now that the economy is better I am sick of being poor and feel that I may actually have some negotiating room.  But where do I begin?  I have never in my life negotiated a salary (22 year old me didnt know I could do that).  Any advice is deeply appreciated.

Edit:  I should clarify that I graduated in 2012 and have been working doing digital marketing for engineering firms, but not environmental firms.  I've been doing petroleum and electrical."
Is There A Website Like This? Where Interests Are Linked To Careers?,"Is there a website that I can just type in a handful of interests/topics I like or excel at that will give me a list of careers that combine those interests/topics?

Example, if I were to type in **Geography** and **Computers**...it would give me a result like **GIS** for instance.

Cause I have a few interests I excel at and I'm certain there are careers that combine these skills, but I just don't know about them? Or haven't thought of them?

BTW, my interests are Geography, Economics & Geopolitics...I'm fairly good at Statistics too (have an undergrad degree in it). Are there careers that combine these skills? or at least 3  of them?

I'm also willing to pick up new skills if it means I can find a career which incorporates 3 of those 4 interests. Like Programming, Business Studies etc."
Do people really enjoy working? I can't decide if I should switch career completly to try to find something I might enjoy doing OR just accept that working sucks and try to find a cushy job that makes it tolerable ?!,"Do people really enjoy working?  I can't decide if I should switch career completly to try to find something I might enjoy doing OR just accept that working sucks and try to find a cushy job that makes it tolerable ?!

Background:

I graduated in accounting 3 years ago, been in  5 position during those 3 years.  Only one of them had work that was tolerable and VERY good condition (friday afternoon off, no stress, not too much workload, 4 weeks vacation, cool colleague, etc.)  basically I am wondering if its normal to NOT like working at all? or its just that I am in the wrong field ?! 

Anyone here is excited when waking up and rly wants to go to work?  (for me i just want to run home after work, and do things I enjoy, like reading, playing videogames, talking to girlfriend, taking a walk, relaxing, etc.)

Whilst it has been most rewarding, it has also been very challenging and I'd really like a change! It's something that's been on my mind for some time and spending so much time at home with the Covid-19 pandemic has really got me itching to try something different but to date my research hasn't brought me much success! 

The thoughts for spending lots of money to do further study doesn't appeal to me as let's face it college courses are ridiculously expensive so I'd want to be sure it's worth my time pursuing it! I'd love to know if there any affordable online options out there that provide recognized qualifications? Also I'd love to hear from people working in fields related working with children and special needs e.g. Autism and learn a bit about their line of work.

Since I qualified as a teacher I've always had to commute long distances for work so I'd also really love to explore options of perhaps working from home or more locally- for example pursing a hobby as a career. I'm interested in working with food as I love baking and cooking and I'd also like to perhaps make my own range of natural products. I also enjoy photography and nature so was thinking of combining the two. I've no real experience apart from working with children but I'm open to learning new skills and broadening my horizons just don't know where to start!

Is it just me or was this interview really odd?,"A bit of background, my career so far has been working with homeless & vulnerable people, doing advocacy, helping people access housing, deal with housing law etc etc. I’ve had a few roles in this field and so am used to interviews in this line of work, however -

I had interview today that was just... odd. First off, I arrived early, they arrived 15 mins late without any apology. The manager interviewing me was **extremely awkward, wouldn’t make eye contact and kept shuffling around in his chair. At first I thought he was just shy, but as the interview went on they just went rapid fire through the questions, either cutting me off mid sentence or leaving long awkward pauses that I felt like I had to try and fill. 

I wasn’t asked anything about myself, just very dry and corporate sounding questions, which is really odd for a support role.  

When I asked questions at the end about supporting clients, the manager actually said “they’re only supposed to stay for 2 years but we’ve had some people for 10 or 11. You can’t exactly empower people with mental health problems, know what I mean? They can’t do shit for themselves”. I was gobsmacked - I didn’t know whether he was trying to catch me out or if this was some weird interview technique or what, but I was so appalled I was shocked into silence. 

Then at the end they basically said “you’ll get an email to let you you’ve been unsuccessful”.

Anyone else had any weird interviews like this?! Should I feed back to the company? I could be being too sensitive but felt like it was really unprofessional."
Is there a job that allows you to work from home?,I don't have a car to transport myself and I live with my parents. I am still in college. My parents are low income so they can't help me get a car or buy a car. So I am kinda stuck at home with no where to go.
"Professional level work load and expectations but paid barely above minimum wage. When is enough, enough?",A little background on me. I am 25 years old with no college degree. Since I started working at 18 I have only had two jobs. Firstly starting in a warehouse to now where I have been for 5 years working in logistics and data analyst. My current company is great for many reasons and terrible in many others. The experience I am getting is amazing and will pad my resume one day. However my largest problem with the company is the culture. Me and many other employees are expected to do work  well above our pay grade.  In a lot of ways I am grateful for this but right now it is hard to justify when I am struggling to pay rent some months. When will the experience not be worth the expense? 
"Wanting to switch careers & really enjoy researching/analyzing information - other than data analyst, what are some careers/career paths I should look into?","I could write a long passage about why I'm choosing to switch careers, but I'll leave that for another time and just include some quick background information:

Current employment: School Counselor (6 years)

Previous employment: Fraud Prevention (3 years), Retail/retail management (2 years), various 2nd/part-time jobs (meat market, office cleaning, tutoring)

Education: B.A. Psychology & Sociology; M.S. in Education/School Counseling

I'm introverted but more than willing to work around, and closely with others (as long as I have some time in the day to work independently to ""recharge my batteries"").  I've looked into data analyst careers and like the overall idea of that type of work.  However, I'm wondering what other careers/career paths might include a lot of researching/analyzing information that I could possibly be overlooking?  If you could also include what type of training/schooling I might need to begin that career, I would appreciate it.

"Failed one of those ""would you rather"" pre-job assessments and I meet all the preferred qualifications for the job. What now?"," There is an internship that I found that I am very interested in. I met all the basic qualifications and 4/5 of the preferred qualifications. The preferred qualifications are things that only a small amount of people have.

I completed the assessment and a day later, I got an email at 1:30am saying that I failed the assessment and that I would have to wait 6 months if I wanted to reapply.

Is it OK to still be searching & applying for jobs even though I recently started a new one?,"I’ve made some posts here in the past and am very thankful for the advice I’ve received. In October, I started a full time position in my field. I took a decent pay cut from my previous job out of my field in attempts to get some experience. It wasn’t my dream job or anything, but it was something to help make connections/make myself more valued in my field.

The pay difference is rough. Lack of enthusiasm is prominent in the company due to this. A lot of my coworkers say the pay is the main reason they hate the job— even after “promotions”. It’s your typical entry level job. It’s about 15k lower than average (our salary is 34k). 

My issue is, I have a lot of experience. Even my boss told me while interviewing me I would be underpaid based on my qualifications, but despite sending out hundreds of applications, I was never invited to interviews. He felt like he struck gold! I took the job hoping that some out of college experience would help.

It’s only been a few months and it is dreadful. My boyfriend is at our old company and continues to get promotions, while I continue to struggle to pay off my basic expenses. Thankfully, he is supporting me in necessary areas, but I am still frustrated. Not to mention work is SO SLOW. I am constantly bored. Constantly asking for more work/more responsibility just to help the day go by. 

Is it bad that I’m looking for other jobs and will switch of a better one comes around? Could I still put this on my resume or will it look bad because it is only a few months?

Overall I just feel like I sold myself short, and that I am not challenging myself. I would love to be more useful and motivated in my field, and can stay here until I find that job, but I feel bad. Any advice is helpful! "
"I lied and it got me in a stupid career pickle, any suggestions?","**Backstory:** I started my career about 2 years ago in a junior IT position, and a salary to match. Well, I've grown professionally a lot since then and thought I'd start looking around for an opportunity that might pay more. I got 3 offers, all in the +10% range, and chose one of them that I liked.

Well, when I told my current company that I'd be moving on, they wanted to know how much the new place was offering, and what it'd take for me to stay. I gave them a number that seemed astronomical to me, and I thought they'd never accept. Well, they did. Today they offered me an annual salary just shy of twice my current, a position as lead engineer, and a relocation package to move to the company headquarters. Basically my dream job.

**The problem:** When they initially asked me how much the other place's offer was, I gave them a number a bit higher than it actually was. I don't know why, but it was really stupid. I guess I said that out of spite since I felt they had been underpaying me. The manager that talked with me about this (upper management actually, not my regular manager) requested a copy of that offer letter as part of whatever processing they do to get me into the new position. I said I'd get it to him....

What should I do??? I'm someone who values honesty, and this just makes me feel really really bad. If I confess, it makes me look stupid and dishonest. I have no logical reason to not send it over. I thought about ""correcting"" the letter, but I'm sure they will call to verify, and then I'm really screwed (with both companies).

I'm not going to do that again for sure."
Would you take a 45% pay raise if it meant working out of state 50+ minutes away?,"I’ve been at my current job for 4 years. There’s no raises or promotions in sight. 

Two days ago a recruiter contacted me through LinkedIn out of the blue and set up an interview at this other company. He sent them my resume and they are having me interview today. If I am offered the job it would be between 34-45% increase in my salary, but my drive to work would change from 12-15 minutes to 45-60 minutes and would take me to the adjacent state. 

What should I do? How would you go about making a decision like this? 

Edit: just came back from the interview. It’s a very small company ~10 employees right now. My current company is much larger with several plants and offices around the country/world. Not sure how I feel about leaving for such a small company."
How does anyone survive working? (Can't stand it anymore),"Is it some big secret by nearly all people in the working world that it literally sucks? Am I doing it wrong. Have been in my job for 5 years, completely drains my soul and I feel 120% dead inside robot. It seems so hard to get a head, I thought good solid work would achieve that then I entered the world of multi direction office politics and multi layered management that don't communicate with each other. It seems like 99% of places operate this way. 

I not sure any job is going to be different. I can't stand being told what to do by someone else just because they are the boss and spend all day doing something I don't care about for someone who is only interested in their own goals. You need to work to live but you can't enjoy living if you are working, even if you do work the cost of living is so high you never get anywhere and struggle to even keep your head above water. It's not enjoyable. 

I can't even enjoy the weekends sometimes. Seriously I'm done. I don't even wear a seatbelt on the way to work anymore. Am I doing it wrong? What am I missing?"
"What are well-paying jobs where you can ""Shut off"" when you come home?",I currently work at a digital marketing agency. I am 24 years old and make 52K a year. I hate my job. The hours are long and the pay is not good for the amount of stress this job causes me. I handle a book with 12 clients. I get emails all hours of the night. I have deadlines to hit every day. It is taking its toll on me physically and mentally. It is midnight and I am still working. I am also going to school for a masters in UX design. I started school before I got this job. My undergrad is a bad liberal arts degree so I really struggled to find consistent work out of school. I don't have many options. My masters degree will put me 16K in debt which is not terrible. I will likely look for a job in UX after this but I really don't think I will be happy doing that either. I want a job that I can shut my brain off with once I go home. I was looking at pharmacy school. I am still fairly young. I figured it makes good money and is often solitary. I've heard it provides a good work-life balance as well. I don't mind going back to school again but I am really looking for a job that pays well and doesn't require a lot of human interaction.
"Has anyone felt they've bombed an interview only to get the job? What happened, and how long did it take to get an offer?","Today, I feel I bombed a very important interview. I got thrown by a question, which set the course of the interview. I feel I rambled through some answers, but I did make sure to circle back and answer it briefly. I've done worse, but I wanted this job, and feel I didn't do as well as I could've. I'd be very interested to hear some stories of this that end in a successful offer. Also, if you accepted it, how did you like working there?"
"Received one job offer but have another interview after the deadline, what should I do?","Job offer dilemma - any advice is appreciated!

So, good news - I received an amazing job offer from the company I interned for this summer (great pay, benefits, plus a foot in the door in the oil & gas industry, a field that I could see myself working in long-term), and the deadline to accept is October 4th. About a week and a half ago, I received a final round interview for another company, where they will be flying me out to OKC for three days for the interview starting October 16th. (I'm a senior ME student by the way).

Company 1: 

1) Had an amazing summer internship experience, really liked the work I did and the company culture.

2) Rotational Program - Living in 3 different cities for 3 years to experience different aspects of the company, really like this idea. Plus I could start my 1st rotation in the city I went to college in, which is appealing.

Company 2:

1) Comparable work to Company #1 (field engineering - lots of travel, etc.. which I like), but less work-life balance (24 hr on call, working on a rig, work holidays, etc..), and also has a sort of rotational program.

2) Starting pay seems to be a little more, than Company #1 (from what I've been able to find online).

3) Potential for international work - This is a big one, I've always wanted to work/live internationally for at least a few years, Company #1 is US only.

I thought about calling Company #1 to ask for an extension so I could explore all possible opportunities, but the same situation happened last summer, and it was denied, so the odds of getting an extension this time are low.  As this is my first full-time job out of school, I really wanted to be able to cover all possibilities so I could make the best decision for myself. What I've been thinking was to accept Company #1's offer, and still go on Company #2's interview - and if Company #2 ends up giving me a better or more attractive offer, to rescind my acceptance.

Does this course of action seem reasonable? I've had some friends do something like this in the past and it seems a bit shady when I think about it, but let me know your thoughts!

Thanks!

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your responses! After talking to my parents and advisor, I decided to accept Company #1’s offer! I’ll still be going on the interview, keeping in mind that I don’t want to burn any bridges even if I get a better offer!"
"In the final round of interviews for my dream job and I just found out I’m pregnant. Worried about having to announce my pregnancy/take maternity leave so soon after I start. Honestly, how bad will this reflect on me to my potential employer?","This pregnancy was very much planned, and my husband and I were going to take a break from trying until I heard one way or the other about this job. Of course I got pregnant right after we made this decision, and after almost 6 months of no success.

All that’s left now is my in-person interview. The job is all of the parts of my career I love and none of the parts I hate, and working for one of the top tech companies in the country. Plus, it pays almost double my current salary. I’ve been applying to jobs for over a year now, and this is the first one that I’m super excited about.

I don’t even have the job yet, but I’m starting to stress out about having to tell them I’m pregnant a few months in and then taking maternity leave a few months after that. One of the benefits is an extremely generous amount of full-pay maternity leave, so I’d be gone for several months after the baby is born.

I don’t want to look like I’m taking advantage of the company and its benefits. For those who have gone through this situation or know someone/worked with someone who has, how bad does this make me look? Is there anything I can do or say to show them that I value this job and plan to be there for a long time (possibly forever)?"
"Graduating soon, what can I do to prepare for future employment, and can my current job help?","Hello everyone, I’ll be graduating Spring 2020 with a Business Degree and I’m wondering what I should start doing to prepare and how much of my current job's responsibilities could be useful on a resume. 

What I mean is, could writing up product / brand descriptions online be considered writing copy, or could responding to customer complaint emails be considered customer support? Ive read that Business Degrees are pretty worthless, so any help would be greatly appreciated!

My current job:

I’m 23 (will be 24 when I graduate) and I’ve worked at a small local business that curates and sells business casual higher end clothes for 5 years now.

My official job title is “Director of Sales” and I have that title on my company business cards/emails/etc. This is obviously a rather inflated title, however I thought that with my last raise I would get a title that would look better on a job resume in the future. Last spring I was invited by the owners to attended an award ceremony with them because we were voted the best clothing store in the area (even beating places like Nordstrom!).


As for my duties consist of the following: 

-   assist with customers (all sales duties, it’s a small shop)

-   research new brands for the store to begin carrying

-   fully process new shipments (sign for, create, add photos, decide MSRP, etc.) 

-   write up descriptions for individual inventory item / website brand landing pages 

-   add new items to our online store 

-   create displays for in store advertising 

-   and social media advertising  

-   occasionally email customers and suppliers who with inquiries about products or orders

-   on my off days I will work online researching brands, or visiting other local clothing stores to check out their inventory in person- taking notes on brands that could fit well in our store.


In addition to this I also help when making larger decisions around the store as well.

I'm really looking for any tips on how to word these duties on a resume to sound better, if there's anything that you would recommend not including on a resume, or any advice on how I can combine this with a degree in order to get a career job post-graduation. Thank you."

How often are you expected to work outside of working hours?,Curious to see how much other employers expect their employees to work evenings or weekends.

How do I find a career I love?,"Hi everyone! I graduated with a double major in Accounting and Management/Human Resources in 2015. After graduating I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do for sure, and ended up getting a job in public accounting primarily auditing. 

It’s now been over three years and I find myself asking myself how is this job making me grow and what drives me. I’ve concluded that it’s not helping me grow other than being more efficient in auditing and overall my drive is the large amount of work I have, not passion for what I do. Then I reflected on how I feel outside of work and basically I feel unfulfilled and am only happy when I’m on vacation/weekends. This brings me to my question, how does one find a career that gets them fired up and ready to go in the morning? I’m sick of having my motivation stem from ‘needing’ to do something rather than ‘wanting’ to do it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! "

Early Career: The Safe Road or the Hard Road?,"I'm turning 26 and currently work for City/Municipality as a Civil Engineer, I work 35 hours a week and make a good chunk more than my friends who graduated with the same degree.

I'm bored, do not feel challenged, and the work really does not resonate with me.  I'm so grateful to have this job.  But a part of me would rather take a substantial paycut and develop skills where I do something new and that I love everyday.

Just as an example, I got offered a Tech consulting gig as an ERP consultant working crazy hours and who knows if it's even rewarding.

My heart tells me everyday to quit and try something new.  Problem is, my position was really competitive (600 applicants for 3 positions).  There's no way I can ever come back after leaving, and I know I'll be grateful to have this job during a recession or when I have a family 5-10 years from now. 

Anyone been in the same circumstance?"
Will turning down a position after an interview hurt my chances of being hired if I apply again in the future?,"To make a VERY VERY long story short, I love my coworkers but I'm not being paid enough. I just got an interview with my dream workplace for tomorrow morning. If my current workplace is able to match their pay and I turned down the position, would they consider me in the future if I re-applied? I'm sure this may vary from workplace to workplace, but I'm wondering if there's a ""generally, yes"" or ""generally, no"" answer that might give me some guidance. "

"I got offered a high-paying, once in a lifetime opportunity job that I feel I am not qualified for. Should I take the job?","I currently have my own business with 2 partners that is doing pretty well.
We have been in talks of me leaving the company and selling my share to them. It's kind of hard to explain why I am leaving my own company, despite it being successful and only getting bigger. But I feel like  it's not challenging enough for me and I am stuck in a rut and not learning and growing, so I want to go work for another company where I can learn and cover up my ""weak spots"" in areas I don't know well.

My partners are supportive of my decision and said there's an ownership spot for me if I ever decide to come back, even if it's years down the line.

Anyway, on to the topic of the title.
A CEO of a very big and well-known company in our industry somehow got wind of me leaving my company and looking for a job (not sure how since only a few people know right now), and called me to ask for a meeting. I met with him and he offered me a very high-paying job running one of his company's departments. I was taken aback my this offer. It is very lucrative and a position most people would kill for. However, I personally believe I am not qualified. I know this CEO from my previous job, where we would interact constantly, so he knows my experience for the most part, which is why it is surprising that he offered this position to me.

I am not sure what to do. I feel like even though I am under-qualified, I can read and study and learn what I need to, and in a few months be somewhat qualified. They also said they will train me. I did want a challenging job and this job will definitely be tough.

My friends and family think I would be stupid to not take the job, and the worst-case scenario would be I get fired but would still learn a lot during my time there even if that happens. They also think I AM qualified and just have low self-confidence, which I admit has always been a personal issue for me.

I was thinking of requesting another meeting and being honest to the CEO with my skills and what he expects, just so there are no surprises, would that be the best way to go about this?

Another complication is that if I take this position, I will technically be competing against the company I started, so that makes things even weirder for me.

"I am a 28-year-old college graduate stuck in a string of dead-end, service industry jobs. How can I make the leap to a proper career path after so many squandered years?","(I originally posted this over in r/personalfinance before a redditor directed me over to this sub, which really seems to be a better fit for the problem I have. Over there, I got a lot of advice to the effect of going to a trade school or looking into things like technical writing or going back into transcription. This is all good advice, and I have been Googling up a storm researching these possibilities. But I am always willing to listen to people who have a better idea of how to handle this situation. Please, bury me in your tips and observations.)

My resume consists of food service for the most part, though I did spend nearly three years working both back and front of house in a brewery. I've also had stints as a package handler at UPS, some transcription work and a glorified cart mule at Home Depot and Wal-Mart as my first two jobs when I was around 19.
I have usually been employed since the age of 19, though there was a long slog in 2016 where I was unemployed. Thankfully, I got over that hump, and I have been working for Chipotle since September of 2016. It pays $9.00 an hour, which is enough for me to live on in a dirt cheap college town even at less than full-time hours, but I'm really just treading water. I'm not working toward anything, and I don't see any future here.

I am moving away very soon even if it means moving back in with my parents in Atlanta. I let myself get caught in a rut, living only for the weekend and grading my life on how many parties I had been to in the past month. I don't drink or smoke or do any drugs. I have no arrests or any kids or ex-spouses complicating my life, but I've still spent most of my 20s living like the dumb college kid I should have outgrown.

I am closer to 30 than 20 these days, and it has dawned on me that I locked myself out of a lot of opportunities by settling for less and just getting by. Most of my peers are out-earning me several times over with jobs and degrees in IT, medicine, accounting or the sciences. I, on the other hand, have a print journalism degree I'm not using after I realized that for all that I love the written word, I don't really like the nature of journalism all that much. The pay and hours were terrible, I felt like scum for leeching on tragedies, etc. So that's the long and short of it. My life has been fun but unproductive. I'm not asking to earn seven figures a year and take yearly trips to Fiji, but something's got to change or I'll be riding a cash register until I drop dead in my 80s."
"Boss doesn't like my face. Literally. Should I ride it out assuming she can't do much more than be annoying about it, confront it, or start submitting resumes elsewhere and hope being ugly isn't such a universal drawback?"," 

Female, in case it matters, which I suspect it does, sadly. I'm fairly ugly. I'm not severely physically deformed or such, but I'm just plain old ugly; huge round droopy nose, sunken in eyes a little too close together, Dwayne's syndrome so one of my eyes doesn't turn outward all the way which leads to a head tilt to compensate, almost no distinction between my chin and my neck, Rosacea means I always look as red as if it'd just run a marathon at all times, gangly and bony. I've worked in programming all of my adult life and generally haven't had to interact with people face to face which helps. On the phone, I have good rapport with end users; fortunately my voice isn't too bad. About a year ago I got transferred to a new office in a new position under a new boss due to some company mergers and such.

I was recently passed up for a promotion in favor of a coworker I trained, whom I was still training at the time of the interview, who has become my supervisor. The two of us were the only ones who applied. She's wholly competent and also has former supervisory experience in another field whereas I have only ever done programming. I'm not displeased with her as a supervisor, nor do I think she is undeserving, even though I'd obviously have preferred the position myself. But I asked what I did wrong in the interview and my boss said it was a fine interview but that I lacked certain soft skills, and lamented it was her fault for never giving me training on expected manners and hygiene.

I shower daily, I use deodorant, I brush twice a day and usually do a mouthwash rinse at lunch so I can't imagine I smell too bad. I wear typical khakis and collared unpatterned shirts, so I'm certain I'm dressed appropriately even if not femininely or stylishly. I've had several performance reviews, none of which have ever had any criticisms whatsoever. Three in a row of just ""keep doing what you're doing."" I've requested and gotten pay raises from past supervisors as I've made contributions and the like.

I interviewed for a promotion (same job, different title = more pay situation) and got it. I've interviewed for this two times prior and hadn't gotten it, and this was the first time my boss was not on the interview panel, but my (new) supervisor was. Last interview for it was a month prior, so no major changes in my qualifications or achievements. A part of me suspected this was not a coincidence that my boss was not on the deciding panel for the first time when I got it, but I get my pay raise, so I'm happy.

Due to COVID-19, we have limited staff in the physical office. I go in twice a week to handle database matters which can't be done remotely due to requiring a direct network connection rather than VPN. My supervisor is also there on one of those days. She had said yesterday that our boss demanded my ID badge photo be changed, because mine was ""unacceptable."" The badge photos are generally taken by a staff member whose entire job is to assure it's an acceptable photo. It's been acceptable this long. It's about two years old, but I've never heard of anyone getting a new picture; there are people in the office who are 60+ who have their ID badge with a photo from when they were hired in their 30s.

The HR processing team is not physically in the office, so my supervisor has to take the photo with her phone. We do that first thing in the morning and get back to work. She comes over a few hours later and says the boss didn't like it, that I must smile ""better."" My mouth is uneven and my teeth are crooked. My entire face is off center. I repeat, I'm not a pretty girl. Trying to force an even smile looks very awkward and more like a cringe than a smile. Sure enough, this one is shot down, too. The boss tells my supervisor I must wear my hair a certain way in the picture (my standard hair style is just straight down flat, nothing special or weird). We have to reshoot three times, each time my supervisor thinking it looks fine, before the boss will accept a picture.

All I can assume is that my boss just doesn't like my face. Are there any other suggestions for me besides ""try to look better"" ?

I'm okay with being ugly, but if I take particular pains to try to look pretty it becomes depressing because it's impossible, or because it would be great effort, money and discomfort just trying to look normal rather than ugly. In an age where everybody has self esteem issues and depression and anxiety, I'm quite mentally hardy, I'm physically fit, I do triathlons as a hobby, I'm successful in a career that requires a certain degree of intelligence, I volunteer at an animal shelter and feel a general sense of connection to my community and purpose and all that; I like myself when I don't have to try too hard to be something I'm not: pretty.

Should I hold out and hope she retires soon? Seek employment elsewhere? Count on my supervisor to be less biased and be a sort of shield?"
Why does it seem like every field nowadays is over-saturated and competitive?,"For example, to name a few:

Web Development / Programming: Mid-2000s, you could get a decent job just knowing some basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The rest you’d learn on the job. Nowadays? You need to know every front-end and back-end language, you need to have an understanding of different frameworks, must have 3-5 years of experience, a portfolio, CS degree, etc.

Nursing: It feels like 2015 is when nursing reached its popularity and started becoming over saturated. Getting into nursing school is now more competitive than ever, and with the exception of some geographic areas, it’s no longer as easy to land a job in nursing (unless of course, you have 5+ years of experience).

IT: I don’t know how IT really used to be back in the day, but nowadays I hear a lot of stories of people struggling to land entry level jobs, despite having certifications and a degree.

Trades: This is usually Reddit’s go-to answer, but apprenticeships are getting more difficult to get into as well (at least in my city). I have friends who are on waitlists and struggling to get in because of the large number of applicants."
My workplace is doing nothing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. What should I do?," I work at FedEx Ground as a package handler trainer. My managers and   their hire ups have done absolutely nothing to prevent the spread of   COVID-19. We are told to wash our hands frequently. However, no one but   me and a few others does this. Its like they all just gave up. I don't   want to get the virus and I honestly don't want to go to work, at the  same time I want to stay safe. What should I do?"
Working a job and going to college full time a good idea?,"I work 32 hours a week and go to four classes. I can feel my stress levels going through the roof. I have bills to pay because my mother doesn’t make enough to support me anymore and she doesn’t get child support. 

I can’t not pay bills, but when I talk about working less she flips and tells me I’d have to leave the house and completely separate from her. Then I’d need to work more. School is very important to me and having ADHD makes it that much worse. 

Work is just draining me. I’m constantly exhausted and stressed trying to get school work done. 

Anyone have any advice? "
Being underpaid compared to a less experienced colleague. What should I do?,"I have recently been told by a colleague (who joined the company this calendar year), that she is earning almost 15% more than me. Now, when I started I was not in much of a position to negotiate and was quite flatly told there was no budget to go higher on it. At this point I had a MSc but only a couple of internships to my name, my colleague had an MSc and one year of work experience in a similar company. So to an extent I understand why she would be earning more than me, although I do think the increase is somewhat shocking given she didn't negotiate her deal. After a year, I was given a 3% increase. I am trying to figure out what to do in this situation, as I feel I am not being fairly compensated for my work. I have been there two years now and am the longest serving member of the team (aside from my boss) by almost 2 years... I take a very active role in teaching new members of the team (which occurs a lot due to some very high turnover of staff, for varying reasons.. none to my knowledge due to any issues with the company or compensation). Yet I'm being paid significantly less than a colleague with a year less experience.

I approached my boss about this on Friday, who has said that I will be getting the usual increase (I am pretty sure it's just an inflation based increase) and that they have a separate pot of money for promotions but that they don't think they can tap into that as it would not be a promotion (I have been turned down for this recently). They said they are going to ask to find out if there is anything they can do about it as they know it's not much of a motivation.

I'd like to get some advice on how to handle this/what you would do in my situation."
"Is there a job/career path that would allow me to work less hours and get paid less? Ultimately my goal is to work less than 40 a week, and I dont need much money.","Hello,

Currently a mechanical engineer with a bachelors. I hate 40 hour weeks. Its way too much. I still want to have some free time where I can continue to learn in.

Im currently looking into going into a new career. What kind of careers have options to work less hours, and get less pay that of course should come with less hours? My problem is, nearly all jobs seem to be 'all or nothing'. 40 hours, or 0. I guess I'm looking for a scaleable job. I just know that I would be infinitely happy with just 2 more hours each weekday. But that simple request feels like it's impossible.

Thanks guys for all input and advice"
"I'm 31(M) and need a career change ASAP, but what to do?","Sorry for the long post, but I'm getting desperate and looking for help and so I think I need to be thorough here in order to provide all the pertinent information I can. 

I'm in my 4th year of doing software implementations and I hate it. I've worked for 3 different companies so far, switching because I always thought that I hated my job because of the companies that I worked for, but I've recently come to the conclusion that it's not the company, but more the actual type of work/industry that I just don't jive well with. I hate it because -

1. I'm overworked. I know this is a problem for a lot of people, but I really value work/life balance and I always end up working \~60 hours a week because there is just so much work to do all the time. I'm always overwhelmed. 
2. I don't care. I'm not passionate about implementing software solutions for large companies to help them save money on software purchases in the long run. When things get hard it's difficult to convince myself it's worth it because what I do doesn't matter to me. 
3.  It doesn't feel real. Working virtually via monitors and phones means the work that I'm doing doesn't feel tangible. I'm not out in the real world providing value in a physical way, which is discouraging. I'm working from home (which is kind of nice) and rarely ever seeing people in real life and all of the solutions I build are on customer servers that I never see the benefits from after I'm done with the project.
4. I constantly get shit on. Software is complicated and things break and/or need to be customized all the time. Clients hate this and even when it's not my fault at all I'm always the guy to get blamed first. This is taxing on me and drives my stress levels through the roof, which I truly believe is causing some real problems with my physical and mental health at this point. I'm constantly under a lot of pressure and project managers are constantly all over me to get work done faster, even when it's unrealistic. 

I chose this career path mainly because there is so much opportunity in the field and it's pretty lucrative (I make around $90k right now). Now I'm realizing that even if I was paid 50% more I still wouldn't want to do this anymore. It's time to figure out what to do next, but that's where things get complicated. I'm interested in a lot of fields, but of course each field has it's own issues and I'm trying to figure out what would work well for me. Some of the topics I'm interested in include -

1. Aviation. I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a kid and tried to go to flight school when I was 19, but I failed the medical exam for an issue that I've been dealing with since then so I might not be able to pass the exam now either (chronic kidney stones)
2. Construction. I've helped build 2 houses before over the course of 2 years and I really enjoyed it. I don't want to do anything too back breaking as I get older though. I would really like to flip houses or be a construction manager or something someday, just not sure how to do either of these without a lot of capital or experience at this point. 
3. Small business ownership. My dad owns a small business and it's worked out really well for him. I've always been interested in entrepreneurship, but taking the leap has always seemed too risky for me because I have student loan and medical debt, and also I'm not sure what kind of business to start (especially without any real startup capital). 

A couple of other important factors to consider in my decision making process here are the facts that my girlfriend, who I plan to marry, is a 3rd year medical student so we will likely be moving in a little under two years for her residency. Also I have 2 bachelor's degrees in business (Information Systems and International Business) which I still have about $20k of debt for. I also love travelling and being outdoors a whole lot. I like helping people and animals and hate corporate america with all of it's politics, bureaucracy, conference calls etc. I'm also a pretty good people person, even though what I do now is very technical I'm better at the business side of my job than I am at the technical side. 

Again I'm sorry for the novel of a post, I'm just really down in the dumps and trying to figure out what change to make in my life and I really feel like I need some 3rd party perspective on what might be a good direction to head in. Thanks for reading!  "
Will a GPA below 3.0 in undergrad bar me from all grad programs 3-4 years later?,I received a B.S. in economics but had a 2.8 gpa after nearly failing a semester (had kidney failure).  I didn't take my classes seriously at the time either.  It hasn't mattered in the job market yet but I want to get a masters degree in the next few years.  A few schools I've looked at require a minimum of a 3.0 GPA in undergrad.  It's been a few years since I graduated; will this still matter that much if I receive high scores on the GMAT/GRE? Has anyone had a similar experience and found a way to get into a graduate program?
Should I remove my photo on Linkedin?,"I have been having such a difficult time with finding getting interviews and finding jobs. I apply mainly on indeed and linkedin. Basically, I belong to a religion which is often stereotyped and I dont want a negative bias to happen before the interviewer meets me at least. I wear the hijab and will also be wearing it at work. 

I was just wondering whether I should:
1. Keep the picture and keep applying 
2. Upload a new picture, maybe so zoomed in that they cant see my hijab? 
3. Remove the pic completely 

What do you guys think? Tired of not getting interviews and I just want a chance."
Does Interior Designer has a future?,"I have strong interest in interior design, yet I'm in the dilemma of chosing Business and Interior Design. I've been told that there's no future for Interior Design because many do not renovate their houses with interior designer since there are lots of interior design samples that could be found online.

Is really the a future for interior design?  If there are many things could be replaced by AI and samples could be simply acquire online, what can interior designer do in the future?"
Should I pursue a second Bachelor's degree or apply to a Master's program so I can gain more experience on my resume?," Hi everyone! I've posted this in a couple other grad school related subs and I felt it would be relevant here.

This is my first post in this sub and as my title suggests, I'm questioning on whether to go and pursue a second Bachelor's degree or continue on to a Master's Program.

I recently graduated with a B.B.A in Economics back in May and after several months of applying to entry level Data Analyst positions and internships, I haven't been receiving any feedback at all from recruiters.

I think my lack of experience in the field is a major turn-off for employers, as I never completed any internships or had any relevant work experience while I was in school. I only took an introductory Econometrics course, but we never were exposed to any of the programs/languages that employers are looking for now. We only used the Data Analysis Toolpak in Microsoft Excel, and only analyzed Simple and Multiple-Linear Regressions from the ANOVA outputs.

This was in addition to analyzing larger data sets in SAP Predictive Analytics, but we were never exposed to R, SQL, SAS, Tableau, or similar programs.

I've always thought about going back to grad school at some point, but if I'm able to get an entry level position as a Data Analyst without a Master's degree, it wouldn't be worth the hassle to enter a Master's degree program. I would only consider grad school if it meant employers taking my resume more seriously.

As far as research interests, I never really thought that far ahead, but if I'm in a program I love, I wouldn't mind compiling/analyzing a data set for a thesis paper. If I were to enter a graduate program, I would probably pursue one where I would have hands-on experience working with R, SQL, Tableau, or similar software.

However, I feel like my only option at this point would be to go back to school, receive a second's Bachelor's degree and complete an internship, as my final undergraduate GPA was a 2.42. I will admit that early on, I was not a serious student and did not take my coursework seriously. It wasn't until my senior year of college that I started to turn my GPA around and took school seriously. In addition, I do not have a strong math/calculus background so I think it would be a hard sell for an admissions committee to consider my application.

As of today, I have not taken the GRE or GMAT exams, but I would be willing to take them if there was a remote possibly that it would help improve my chances of applying somewhere.

Please let me know what your opinions are on my situation, as I really want to start a career where I actually am excited to get out of bed and go to work in the morning.

Thanks again for everyone who's read down this far! Any advice at this point would be extremely helpful!"
"Almost 30, a B S, working a crap job, and lost in how to start a career?","Okay, so background:

I'm almost 30. In highsschool, I was extremely bored and wasn't on any ADD/ADHD meds (on account of some bizarre self-reasoning I had) and wasnt pressured by my family to be anything other than myself. I'm an ""artist"" type and was always encouraged to pursue my creativity. I smoked a lot of pot, slept in class all day, and took the slacker route out of a place I truly loathed being at. I graduated early and never took higher level maths, foreign languages, the SATs, and had a GPA of idk ...1.7 or something. 

Went to community college to basically do all the the general education stuff. I started taking medss and realized that I'm not an idiot....I honestly thought I was stupid. I figured out what I wanted to study, and made plans to study it. I chose industrial (product) design because it was a good marriage of my love for sketching, design, and keen sense of aesthetics with my problem solving abilities. I tried going to the local state college nearby that had that major, but it was really small and I didnt get in. I wanted to avoid a fine Arts college, because i didnt want to deal with being taught theory. I wanted to to go to a super awesome ($$$) school....but would have to spend time teaching myseld things to build a portfolio, likely be rejected, and then try multiple times. I was 23 at the time and felt like I had to go to school and had to go then, or else I never would. So, i chose a college out of state where I had a community of close friends, but also really dug the energy and creativity in the area. 

 I worked hard. I learned a lot. I set standards and a lot of my peers and mentor respected me. Towards the end, things got a little out of control in my personal life; I ended up moving home shortly after graduating. I knew the job market for me here (home) was going to be rough.....not a lot of options.....but I had no other choice.  After the first year, I gave up trying to relocate. Given my lack of experience, I wasnt even considered for non local positions. I applied and applied and applied to literally everything I saw that was remotely related to what I know how to do and that would also be good for my long-term career plans. 

The problem I found was because my background is in design, companies looking for entry level CAD or 3d Modeling people were more focused on engineering backgrounds, despite the fact that a good portion of my education involved mechanical engineering and technical designing. Given, it is something Id need to learn more about hands on, these are still entry level positions and I would not be in over my head.
 So, I sat around at my parentss house unemployed (an odd end job here or there) avoiding applying to work at large retailers. I eventually caved and have now been at one almost a year.

The problem:

I recently just had an interview (for the first time in months) thats so entry level its just cleaning machines.....but definitely in the realm of what im interested in doing. But, yet again, I hear nothing/rejected. I dont know exactly what it is Im doing so wrong. I'm smart; a fast and competent worker. I get stuff done fast, correctly, and notice the things everyone else misses. I would rock literally any job that doesnt involve customer service.....which isnt anything im applying for. I'm an organaizational mastermind and can compartmentalize tasks for efficiency like a motherf****r. I have communication problems and tend to not understand fully the impact of my statements, body language, or facial expressions. People often ask me if im okay when im thinking or dilligently looking for something. Theres a running joke in my closest circle of friends and family that im on the spectrum (autism).  The more advice I seek on professionalism, job applications, and etc....the more confused I get. Im not so discouraged I want to throw the towel in, I'm just so confused as to what Im doing wrong that I don't even know HOW to approach anything anymore. I work crap hours (7pm to 6am) and make $11 an hour. I can only afford to live because of cheap rent and my parents pay for my car insurance, phone, and a good percentage of my living expenses.  I'm always tired, my body is getting slowy wrecked from my job, and the longer I go not using the skills/software I learned in school, the farther I fall behind. What's the point of learning expensive precise technical software if you can't find a job using it? 

My feelings:

I feel like people falsely judge me . I feel passively discriminated against for being a woman. If I was myself, my personality, my everything.....except with a beard, a deep voice, and third leg....I honestly dont think Id be in the same position. If my face was different and not like a 12 year old doll face or if I wasnt so middle class and on paper uninteresting....I honestly feel like my experiences would be different. Or Im just fundamentally unlikable - not sure. I don't need tons of money to be happy....I just want to contribute what I have to offer and actually use my potential in any capacity vs watch it wither away.  I'm pissed that our society breeds this kind of discontent. Highly capable and intelligent people who need to be challenged in life but arent industrious/smooth/lucky enough to actually sew the seeds they were born with. How efficient or advanced is a society that fails at utilizing its citizens to their full potential and ends up promoting and rewarding charlatans to the point there is a phrase ""fake it until you make it"" (until you go to jail). ?

I'm not necessarily looking for advice - unless you have something worthwhile to say. Really, I just want to hear anyone else's story who experiences my frustration. So, am I alone in all this?"
Is it bad that I'm about to screw over my boss by denying a promotion he's worked really hard for me to get to join another company?,"Hello! I haven't been happy at my job for a while now. I could list the reasons why but I'll just add a couple: Low team morale, flawed product, substantial work limitations. The one thing I love about my job, however, is my manager. He cares about his team, is extremely dedicated to making us happy and to get the team working well. He knows I've wanted out for a few weeks, I would never admit, but about 4 people on our team left the company so he's pretty stressed, and broke the news that I wanted to join a different team in the organization. Instead of getting mad, he put in a good word for me and got me an interview (it'd be a promotion technically, just in a different department). 

&#x200B;

I had the interview and I kind of nailed it, and they said they wanted me to join but will have to go over logistics on when I can join. My manager kept me hired, has been treating me like this hasn't even happened and has patiently been waiting for them to make the offer. He is a gem.

&#x200B;

Unbeknownst to him, I've been applying elsewhere for work because I like to have my options open. A job that I would love has shown extreme interest and I'm in my final rounds of interviews tomorrow. I don't have it yet, but there's a chance I will get this offer, and the internal offer at about the same time and I can't help but feel like I'd be screwing over my current boss and the potential new boss if I was to say yes to this other job because they've both put time and effort into securing my position with this internal promotion. Should I feel guilty or is this ok?"
"Started A New Job In IT, Wanted To See If This Was Normal?","So i started a job in an IT Helpdesk position this week and it has been going, strangely. I wanted to see if this was normal in the work place and in this position.

So I have no prior IT experience other than building my own computers, troubleshooting my own problems, worked at a cellphone carrier before doing technical troubleshooting and a lot of problem solving with phones, and i went to a year long bootcamp and graduated for programming and web development. I guess they liked my problem solving skills, and experience in programming which is why i got the job. Anyways, the company is smaller than small i would say. They have been around since 1990 and their biggest client is a few auto dealerships. In total there are 7 people in the whole company, 2 of them being the owners(brothers).

Anyways, so they aren't training me at all, they give me a list of tasks and i need to complete them by the end of the day. I have no problem with that since with coding its a lot of finding the answer on my own and sink or swim situations aren't new to me. But i feel like im doing a lot more than what my initial position stated. Ive been shadowing too and ill be doing everything from desktop support to imaging computers and deploying them to doing wiring and setting up networks and everything in-between. They had me sign a w4 but no direct deposit, im supposed to work 8am-5pm but i would get here at 7:40 and nobody would show up until 9am. Nobody would call or text me, they havent even given me their phone numbers and they didnt even know mine. One of the employees went out of her way to get me everyones phone number. They agreed to move my time up to 8:30, so ive been getting here at that time and nobody shows up still until 9-9:30. I dont have a key or a code to get in because they wont give me one. They wont even give me the wifi password. ive asked for all of that stuff and they wont give me anything.

Lastly, we are supposed to get reimbursed for our mileage if we drive out to a client, but they dont even track that. I dont even know if they track my time worked because we dont even have a clock in system. It seems very disorganized and i didnt know if this was a normal thing for an IT company?

I'm not trying to bitch and moan i just wanted to see if this was all normal.

EDIT: I have been let go today in my first week because on top of dumping all of these things I had to learn, they expected me to go above and beyond and vacuum the floors and clean the work bench and help carry boxes and said my attitude seemed distant and I explained to them that it’s because this week i have gone through a lot in my personal life and tried to not have it reflect at work. Also because they think they don’t have the time to devote to help me learn like they want so I’ve been let go. "
If I shit the bed on an interview question should I try to salvage it in a follow up email?,"I just had an interview for an internal promotion. I’m well qualified, was encouraged to apply by my manager, and I think it went well except for this one question. But the one question.... was bad. I got flustered and left out important stuff, and I’m afraid I came across sounding disrespectful and insubordinate.

Is it okay to add to my answer as part of a thank you email? For example explain that in retrospect I didn’t address XYZ aspect, and wanted to clarify my response since it’s a critical part of the job?"
"I'm really not ambitious, nor do I have much in the way of interests or skills. What should I do for a living?","Have you ever watched the movie Office Space? Main character in that is how I feel - I just don't want to do anything really. I don't care much for travelling the world, owning a business, starting a family or anything else like that. A small apartment on my own with video games, junk food and TV will do me.

Still, I have to have an income to support that (right now I'm working 10 hours a week at a small shop and burdening my parents by living at home). Question is, what's best for me? I really can't see a career I'm interested in. I won't learn to drive (I'm too anxious and slow paced). I can't do anything involving handling food and drink due to alopecia. Intelligence wise, I'm a fair bit below average. Above all else though, I'm lazy, to the point where suicide seems kinda preferable to working full time; like life's not worth a huge amount of effort to me. What should I do?"
"Is it cool to apply to a job I don't want, but definitely could do just for the interview practice?","It's been a while since I had an interview because I haven't needed one, but I'm looking at getting back into construction in a white hat role, rather than a tradesman.

How can an introvert with teaching and sales experience escape people-centric work and still make decent money?,"I taught high school for 3.5 years after college. I just did it because it was a job, not my passion or anything. I left that and went into retail sales and work 100% commission now. I do well; I'm one of the top people in the region, and I might break six figures this year. But realistically it's not a career path, and commissions will only be cut in the years to come, so I need to look elsewhere. I'm a very introverted person and would like to transition into something that does not involve so much human interaction, but all of my experience is heavy on humans.

General information: My degree is a BA in English with a focus on and honors in creative writing, so not particularly marketable. I'm 28, female, and in the Houston area. Sometimes I consider doing postbac studies in something computer related, and while I imagine I would become good at it, I do not have any relevant experience, and my work schedule doesn't play well with any other obligations."

My favorite school subjects was math/science. English is my kryptonite.

I am a bigger guy that needs to lose weight and slowly working on that which will make physical jobs hard for me. Not to mention i injured my back at a young age 21 working as a CNA.

I am not a fast paced person. I am slow to average in speed. I chicken peck typing around 20-30wpm. I have basic computer skills turn on and off and web surf or put in a application. If you have other questions please ask if needed.

What is the safest decision?,"I left my last position under good circumstances, yet came very close having horrible consequences.  

I am in my mid 30s and am terrified of making a poor mistake with my next job.

All three options are in the realm of my training (logistics), however each come with risks.

One is with a very large firm that offered me a job based on experiences I had 3-5 years ago.  That knowledge hasn’t been tapped into for years.  I am very rusty on it, however I have the certifications that say otherwise.  This would require a move.  This pays the best for salary (six figures).  Contract based.

One is local, however it is with a medium sized firm that pays the best (Cost of living).  Great job security, however been in same spot for 7 years and ready to see new things and leave some things behind.

One might be considered a step down but is incredibly easy work.  Near best in COL.  would require a move.  Would be big fish in little pond.  Would be closeish to home but that doesn’t matter during covid.

I’m a mess right now with these options.

Is it worth it to apply to job postings that has been up for 1+ months?,"Especially if I meet 70%+ of the qualifications they mention?

Burned Bridge after working for employer for a year and a half. What to say in future interviews?,"As the title reads, I unfortunately lost my cool and quit my job on the spot after being with them for a year and a half. I've never done this before and consider myself a good reliable, employee but for some reason I found myself walking out of this service job.

To provide some context I graduated 2 years ago from a decent school with a degree in Marketing and was unhappy with the job prospects out of school. Without finding anything permanent, I ended up working a service job in the beverage industry and began to enjoy it over time. It was a cool, hip spot and I felt like I fit in with the culture. I ended up making my way into the manager role which was a welcome promotion but still left me deeply unsatisfied. I appreciated the experience and the responsibility it taught me but it still did not feel right and left me yearning for more. I also live in an area that is extremely slow in the off-season and has a huge rush in the summer months, so the winter months left me with little to do. Also the work environment became horrible over time. I realized my co-workers were extremely bad people and it began to effect me over time, mainly my mental health. I was treated so, so poorly by coworkers on countless occasions. I'd rather not get into specifics but I needed to get out of this small town bubble.

Because of my dissatisfaction, I decided to look for housing and work closer to my circle of friends where we attended our undergrad. I fell in love with that area and wanted desperately to go back. So I let my work know months advance that I had begun looking for housing and work and gave them a rough timeline of how things would play out. It's a tiny business and we are all pretty friendly for the most part so I thought this was just a normal conversation. Turns out they demoted me of my position and cut my hours drastically after hearing word of my notice. This meant loss of the few benefits I had and much, much lower pay after being there for a year. My time was cut in half. Not to mention the work environment had become worse than ever. I am currently down 10 pounds my normal weight and it's taken a noticeable toll. In hindsight, I should have never given my notice to the company but I thought it was the genuine right thing to do so they would be in the best shape come the busy summer months.

So the other day I decided that my life is too short to be miss-treated like this so I walked out. I explained to my boss the situation and they are not happy whatsoever. Luckily, I have plenty of savings by living at home, have had many job interviews (sales/marketing) in the area and will be moving in mid-July.

But for now I am 23, unemployed, and have a feeling of guilt that I can't shake. I feel worse than before. I'm disappointed that after all that time I burned a bridge and acted poorly. I'm also worried that this will hurt me in future interviews. I'm just hoping for some general advice and different opinions on this situation. I know I screwed up."
Is catty/condescending behavior from coworkers a good enough reason to quit?,I like my job but being the youngest and only male member of my team I often pick up on catty and condescending tones from my coworkers.

Feeling defeated at work. How do you get out of the funk?,"I manage a sales development team at a series D start up. Been here 3 years and worked my way up out of the trenches of cold calling. 

Past few months, I've been feeling defeated  and lack the motivation and drive I've always had. Sucks because I have people to look after, and motivate.

I've been talking to some recruiters, but the issue is me not the job. 

How do you pull yourself out of  rut when it starts to affect your work?"
Can I accept an offer with the intent to leave if I find something better?,"I was just offered an internship for Summer 2019. It's a good position, but not my top choice, which doesn't post openings until January. In the offer, they stipulate:
""Your employment is on an “at-will” basis, meaning that both you and the Company are free to terminate the employment relationship at anytime, for any reason,with or without notice, and with or without cause."" To me this seems that I could withdraw at any time without repercussions.

If I don't get my top choice, I would be pretty happy with this position, so I don't want to outright say no. Is it in my best interest to accept the position but continue looking for something better and then withdraw if I do get a better offer? Has anyone done something similar to this, because it seems like the best option, but it makes me a little uneasy. Will there be any repercussions to this, legally or more holistically, such as being blacklisted from the company for future positions?"

Hi Reddit,

Going through a small dilemma here. I was recently offered a position at a startup. I'm currently working as a freelancer at a fortune 500 company.

Some details:
My current position pays me $34/hour. Full time annually that would be $65,280 assuming I work every day. I don't. Even though Im ""permalancing"" of course that means I dont get paid for holidays (such as this week, I have the full week off). I currently dont have health insurance (missed the window where I can sign up) nor do I have a 401k contribution.

The startup offered me a full time position for $70k annually including benefits. This includes insurance, paid time off, 401k contributions, commuter benefits, stipend for health-related costs ($400/year), free meals at work, and cooking classes.

Question is, should I move forward and accept or try to get a full time offer at my current company? I have only been at my current company for a little over a year, and I'm pretty sure the only reason I was considered and offered the position at the startup was because my current company is so well-known.

Any help/guidance would be truly appreciated.

Thanks.

"Should I stay in a miserable job while looking for a new one, or should I quit and try looking after moving to a new city?","Hello All,

I will try to keep things brief while adequately explaining my situation. Basically, I have been working my first real job out of college for just over a year and a half now. I graduated with a double major in History and Chinese from my university, and found my current job on the other side of the country.

Basically, I work for the American branch of a large state-owned Chinese company on the West Coast. My position is a “Technical Translator”, meaning I’m meant to translate technical documents and provide interpretation. It seemed right up my alley when I started.

Now, I’ve realized I am completely miserable here. If you’ve never worked at a Chinese company before, things tend to be a bit chaotic- very little planning, work way outside of your job description, and generally lots of moments that make you question your sanity. I interned at another Chinese company before so I kind of had an idea of what to expect. It is definitely wearing me down now. I am either spending weeks at a time with literally nothing to do, or I am having periods of crazy overtime and spontaneous cross-country business trips. The atmosphere at work has also become toxic with lots of people moving to other jobs.

Moreover, I am extremely unhappy living here in Southern California. All of my family, who I am very close with, are on the East Coast and everything is crazy expensive here. Don’t get me wrong, it has its merits, but it is NOT for me.

These factors have been wearing down on me so much that I ended up getting diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder for the first time. At the beginning of this year, I realized that I needed to go. However, 10 months later I have had no success. This is mainly because I resolved not to quit until I had found a better job.

My strategy has been to look for jobs in the aviation industry, where I work now. However, because my current job is such a niche position, I have seriously been struggling to find jobs I can even realistically apply for. Even then, my biggest handicap has been my liberal arts background. I know majoring in liberal arts was a huge mistake, but I am stuck with it. I thought I could use my experience in the industry, but it has not come out for me at all. Everything wants either engineering or software design backgrounds. I only managed to be interviewed for one job this year, and they told me I was “unconventional” and that most people they hire are engineers, even for non-technical positions. Everything else has been rejection after rejection.

Geographically, I have been applying for jobs only in places I want to live, like back east or in places like Colorado, where I’ve always wanted to live. I'm wondering if it would be better to just quit this job and move somewhere I would want to live. I've read many times that finding a job is much harder when you don't have one already. At the same time, I also wonder if a lot of jobs I apply for don't consider me to be a serious candidate because I live so far away from them. 

My question at this point is, what would be your recommended course of action given my situation? Should I just quit my job and move somewhere I want to live, then look for a job? I have enough savings to live off of for months, but I know it is harder to find a job when you’re unemployed. Should I just suck it up and go back to school for something more technical? Should I just keep sticking it out here until I find something better? For more context, I am relatively young: 24 years old.

I know things should be kept objective here but the emotional part of this situation is just killing me. I am starting to think this niche job is all I can ever be, and I will be stuck here away from my family forever. I am absolutely miserable here but can’t see any escape. I’m hoping I can get a more realistic perspective from the people here.

Thank you for reading, and I apologize for the lengthy post.

Edit: thanks everyone for the variety of viewpoints and advice. I can’t reply to all of them but I can say they are very helpful and will factor tremendously in my decisions moving forward."
"Hating my master's degree. Completely lost with my career, chose the wrong university degree, how can I remedy things?","UK. 

I have had a crazy few years. I studied Psychology at University after being really passionate about it during A-Levels. I was interested in Mental Health and was motivated to become a Clinical Psychologist. I knew that I wanted to do some travelling as well so I got a job as a Support Worker with children with learning difficulties to get some Clinical Experience before travelling. 


A year later, I leave my job and travel to Australia alone. But I get into a relationship before I leave. Why? Well I'm stupid and fell in love. Anyways, so I travel and come home after 5 months and decide to start working on my career again. Every possibility goes through my head. 


I finally decide to go back to studying so I can eventually become a Clinical Psychologist hoping that through University I can become re-motivated. 


I'm now a few months into my course and I hate it. Like really hate it. It's a really good uni too. I just feel disillusioned by Clinical Psychology. It's so research based and I'm incredibly bad at stats and anything maths related. 


I've always enjoyed creative things like writing, music and art but I've always kept them as my hobbies because I know how difficult it is to make money off of them but now I'm thinking that my only chance of not being miserable the rest of my life is to pursue something like that. 


I am also really interested in languages, I've started to learn Spanish in my spare time. Also I'm 23 so I have plenty of time for a career change, I just have no clue where to go. 

Any ideas? "
Is this a midlife crisis or a wake up call?,"I’m a 41 year old male who lives about an hour from Perth, Western Australia. I work in advertising sales and have done for most of my working career. Have you ever felt like you have had the same conversation with the same people over and over and over and over? I simply cannot do it anymore...

I have no degree and no real sense of what I want to do with the rest of my life. There is very little unqualified work in and around my home town and I really feel trapped in my current position. It’s becoming very difficult to keep living the same day over and over doing something I despise.

How do I find my passion? How do I change career paths and get qualified? Can anyone help???"
"Experiencing extreme burnout, depression, rumination and had to take time off. I wish I'd have done something about it before I got into this shape. Can anyone give me some advice?",I’ve been with a great company for 20 years working as a drafter/engineering tech in which I’ve experienced burnout for quite some time. I started having depression symptoms in July and tried to adjust my meds and struggled through for two months but wound up having a breakdown and having to take time off. The depression has gotten worse with wicked insomnia and problems focusing due to rumination. Right now I’m just trying to get help and focusing on healing my mind. I feel with this much skin in the game as far as time at the job I should just stick with it at least till I’m in a better place. I feel trapped anyways cause I am in a specialized field and a transition would be so difficult. I would greatly appreciate any advice.
What the hell should I do?,"I’ll give you the broad strokes and add detail as needed if anyone cares to respond to this.

I’m 35 years old.  I have a wife and two kids (4 yrs and 3 months old).  I currently work around 50 hrs/week as a welder.  I make $45,000/year.  I’m the sole bread winner for the family.  Needless to say, money is tight.  We never go without anything we need, but there’s not a lot left over at the end of the month.

I weld because it’s the only think I’m really qualified to do.  I hate it.  It’s mind numbing and hard on me physically.  

I spent most of my early adulthood in the Army.  
I got out with a pretty nasty case of PTSD.  Out of pride I never really sought treatment, instead I self medicated with alcohol.  In the last five years I was convicted of a DUI and 4 public intoxes.  My credit is shit due to poor drunken decisions.

Almost two years ago I broke down and finally went to a 28 day inpatient treatment center for my alcoholism.  I’ve been sober for almost a year now.

This last year of sobriety has brought me a lot of clarity.  I want better for my family and myself.  I think a big part of that will be to improve our financial situation.  I think in order to accomplish that, I’ll need to change career fields.  What kind of training/schooling/internship can someone in my position undertake that will actually make a difference?  

I’m so lost.  I would walk over hot coals if that’s what it took.  I don’t lack ambition or work ethic, but I lack direction.

I would love some advice.  "
What career fields are worth going back to school for?,"So I'm completely lost on what to do with life. Working in an industry I hate, trying to pursue my dream but sadly it's not a stable field so I may never succeed at it.

I currently have a BA in Political Science, but I opted not to go to Law school. I'm trying to decide whether I should go back for another Bachelors degree or maybe a Masters. I'd also like to explore going to school in another country (currently in the US).

I feel like one of the only practical degrees these days is Computer Science, but I'm not a fan of programming.

My main interests are Performing Arts/Entertainment, Languages, Politics, Meteorology or Seismology, Archaeology, and the Travel industry.

I'm just not sure there is any degree I can get in those areas that's going to be that successful.

Are there any other areas I should explore? Anyone have any idea what degrees might be useful from schools outside the US (mainly the UK or Ireland)?"
"Looking for a new, light-hearted career that won’t crush my soul...any advice for me?","TL;DR at the end. 

So, a bit of context to my title: I graduated university with a degree in criminology and psychology. I have a real curiosity about the human psyche, supporting our vulnerable and justice. 

After graduation, I took the first job I could get - investigating and intervening in cases of child abuse and neglect. It was soul crushing to say the least. I quickly burn-out and moved on to a role I feel is more suited to my studies. 

At the moment I work in a local level court, providing case management for people who are in the community awaiting sentencing. Essentially, my job involves supporting people experiencing things like drug addiction, mental illness, homelessness, and trauma. It’s a rewarding, but equally soul crushing and stressful job. I see a lot of the dark side of society and frankly, it’s taking a toll on me. 

As a result of all the downtime from COVID-19, I’ve realised my work is making me anxious and depressed, and that maybe, this line of work isn’t for me at all. Ideally I want to do something that makes me happy; or at least, doesn’t fill me with dread on a Sunday night. 

The decision feels easy but I’m also trapped - my current salary is amazing and I have a debt as a result of my studies. I live in Australia so I’m not worried about the financial impact of the debt, just the sense of guilt that I went and racked up a debt for a career I will ultimately not be pursuing. 

I guess my question is - does anyone actually work a job that makes them happy? Where they feel positive and aren’t impacted by all the suffering in the world on a day to day basis? 

TL;DR : I’m completely burnt-out from my work with vulnerable people in awful traumatic situations. I need a job that makes me smile and doesn’t bring me down. Send help."
Any certification or training in 6 months for salary of 50k or more in Los Angeles region?,"Hi Reddit.

Former teacher here.

COVID-19 hit hard and now I am staying home with unemployment.

I got burnt out after 7 years of teaching, so now I think it is a great opportunity to change career with unemployment kicking in.

I have a bachelor's in Biology and I need around 3k a month after taxes to survive (mortage, cars, insurance, student loan, cell phone, utilities)

Are there any certification or training in 6 months that could land me to a career with 45-50k salary?

Any advice for an extremely indecisive person trying to choose a career?,"Hey guys, so here’s the deal. I’m 23 and ever since I graduated high school, I’ve been working and taking community college classes on and off. I have considered several different career options only to change my mind about them. I feel like I overthink every aspect of it and at this point, I feel like I need to just choose something and go for it even if it may not seem like my “dream job” because I don’t want to keep wasting time being wishy washy. I want to get my adult life started already. So I guess I’m wondering if you guys have any advice on what I should do about this predicament. I don’t want to feel like I’m settling but I also don’t want to keep wasting time."
23 year old social worker in LA looking to switch careers.

Which is smarter - take a bird in the hand job even if not ideal or wait? Need to decide today.,"If you'd been unemployed a few weeks and were offered a role a couple rungs down from your previous one, 25% lower salary - and had no other roles lined up (although a lot of interviews) would you take it or wait? Financially I can hold out a little bit but my concern is the unknown of whether I'll be offered a role I'm more excited about and/ or one that pays more. How do you know you can afford to punt on the unknown in a job search?"
"Top of my company now, but in a small business. Would I need to apply for lower positions when looking for a different job?","For a bit of a background, I work for a small business right now as an Executive Director. I'll be 100 percent honest in that I gave myself that title basically so I could sign any required forms and also speak to clients/contacts. I work in a small nonprofit, and I do essentially run the entire thing as my board is not always helpful (I don't totally blame them as I get a salary, they do not -- they also have their own full-time jobs). I take care of every aspect of the business including calls, bookkeeping, budgeting, client meetings, marketing, grant writing, IT issues, etc.  This nonprofit is pretty successful and we have been around for about 4 years. 

&#x200B;

On top of this, I also help the CEO of a company who we share office space with in running his small business. It includes many of the same tasks, but also a lot of graphic design and overall program management. 

&#x200B;

I am not actively seeking a new job as of yet, but am opening myself to the idea of it. With both of these companies being small business and also family owned, I fear that they have an expiration date within the next five years. I'd like to stay as long as possible because I am learning a lot since I essentially have responsibilities in every aspect of each business. I don't know that I'd have that in a bigger company with a more defined position.  At the same time, I don't want to wait until it's too late (the companies go out-of-business/sell/close) to start looking.

&#x200B;

What I am confused about, is what kind of jobs would I look for? I don't believe I have the experience to be an ED in a large organization, but I think I could certainly do more than an administrative level too.  I enjoy the nonprofit sector, and work in healthcare, but I would probably want to get out of healthcare if I were to seek a different career path because at times, healthcare can be a little soul crushing. Before this I answered phone lines for a help desk. My friends/family say I undersell myself, but I know it's a big difference from going to a startup company to something larger. I feel that I'd have to look for lower positions. Sorry that was long, thanks for your input.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Work as Executive Director in small business, do I need to look for a lower position if looking for a career in a larger sized company? If so, what kind of position?"
"I hate my job, is it worth pursuing meaningful work again?","I work for a high end sales company in a really beautiful location which I initially thought was the perfect job. It's been about half a year now of working there and I have begun to detest it so much. I am trying to gain clarity on my next move. Here are the reasons. 

1. You get talked down to and shouted by rich people almost everyday, which is incredibly frustrating especially when you're from a poor background.
2. The business in general is very discriminatory. They only hire white, attractive people (usually females) for customer facing work. Whereas anyone of colour - or anyone who doesn't fit into this category is hidden away - which is something I hate being a part of.
3. The company's customer care is incredibly poor. You essentially have to ask for contributions from the customers if something goes wrong which is very awkward and you get a lot of abuse for it. The business is only about money and it is glaringly obvious. I do realise this is what business is all about. However, I am not money orientated and is draining me to the core.

I started this job because I wanted to open an ethical clothing chain - because I hate fast-fashion and I thought it would be good to get more of an insight into business. However, I'm starting to think that business is not the right path for me. 

&#x200B;

I used to work as a Support Worker for children with disabilities and wanted to go into mental health work. I am considering trying this again because I get no satisfaction from my work at all.

Thinking of quitting my new job after 3 weeks for a $40K pay cut. Am I insane?,"Been at my new job in a new city for about 3 weeks. The work is fine, but not my passion. I've been offered a job at my dream company, doing exactly the work I want to do, in the city I want to be (other side of the country, where my girlfriend currently lives). I know quitting a job you just started is generally poor etiquette. I know the girlfriend part probably isn't relevant to this subreddit, but it's a pretty major component for me (we've already been long distance for \~2 years).

The other major piece to consider is the money. The salary and benefits are about the same, but the new job has no signing bonus. My current job has a huge signing bonus (about $40K). If I quit in less than a year, I have to pay it back. I haven't spent it yet (since I was aware this situation might happen). I could just suck it up and stay for a year, but I'm worried I might not get another opportunity like this, plus I don't want to set my career back an entire year. What do I do?"

Would you leave your cushy corporate director of sales job for a cannabis sales position?,"I’ll try to keep this brief...

I am a Senior Director of Sales working for a company in a specialty industry. I started working for this company 10 years ago when they were a start up.  I have a been an impact player for them and they have taken very good care of me. We recently sold to a huge company. I am in a prime position on the growth sector of the business. All in all, things are good with the exception of the impending changes coming from the accusations. 

In September I was approached by a cannabis company looking to expand their product offerings in the specialty industry that I am highly skilled and networked in. I would come in as a Vice President of the channel. I would be responsible for building and executing the business plan. The whole company is very much in start up phase. Start up and scaling business is what I know. In my 10 years I have opened 8,500 Retail doors. 

I’ve done my homework. Spent hundreds of dollars to talk with professionals in the space i.e lawyers and industry god fathers. 

I interviewed, they liked me a lot but I told them in November that the timing wasn’t right. Recently they came back and said they would like to keep the conversation going. Saying they believe they can make me very happy. 

Looking for input on this alternative space and how you’d look at leaving a corporate position for something like this. My main ask is going to be equity. 

Where do you see the Cannabis industry going and would you see it as a huge opportunity to get in on the ground floor or no different that any other start up company? 

About me- mid 30’s. Family that I support. No debt outside of a $1,000 mortgage and I have enough in the bank to pay that off and still have plenty to lean back on. Good retirement built up as well. Wife had a job that could support us if needed based on our low level of expenses.

"What are some decent-paying jobs that involve ""creating"" and working from home or anywhere you want (mobile)?","I recently graduated from uni and realized what I did was not was I wanted. I have a degree in food science and work in food industries in quality assurance. Food is interesting, but this kind of work is not. It's tedious and routine, I need to change shifts from morning to evening and back every couple weeks, which really affects my sleep schedule, the pay isn't all that great either, and to be honest, I don't even like science that much in the first place. At least not tedious work like this. 90% of graduates end up doing this kind of work. I figured, if I better change to something while I'm young now or I'll end up stuck doing this forever.

I've been wanting to do a career change and came up with a few points that I would really want in a job. I don't know what kind of jobs to look for or what to go back to learn for, but I hope someone may have an idea:

* I think I would enjoy doing a creative sort of job. Anything that allows me to ""create"" something would satisfy me I think. However, the last two points are far more important to me. If there is no such job that can satisfy all three, then the last two would do fine if possible.

* I hate the idea of being controlled by your job to move to where you find work, so I would like a mobile job that can be done working from home, or anywhere else. I assume, working on something that involves a computer, or at least a job that is fine with you being anywhere as long as you are able to connect with the employer through phone or computer.

* Lastly, a decent pay, or something that can work up to a decent pay. I was lead to believe that creative jobs don't pay well in school, which was what led me into going into the sciences. I obviously need to still support myself and have something that can give me a decent amount of money to save up and use for certain goals."
"35 with no real marketable skills, how to get started?","I made a lot of poor career decisions early in my adult life and have just realized recently that I have no real career path or marketable skills, and I'm really starting to worry that I will die deep in debt with nothing to show for it.  I'm hoping for some suggestions on how I can build some skills and actually start a real career so that I can maybe retire one day.

Back story:
I went to college right out of high school and had to pay my own way.  I worked throughout college just to pay for necessities but still had to take out lots of loans to pay for tuition and books, and I'm at the point where I don't think I will realistically ever be able to pay off that debt.

When I was in school for history, I worked at the college doing general IT stuff (desktop support mostly) which was actually a lot better for getting jobs than my degree.  Since college, I worked at a company running sound for concerts and corporate events, but then got a job working phone tech support for my local ISP.  Did that for a couple of years, then traded up to a job doing support for a Microsoft vendor company only to have my entire team laid off and outsourced to another country after another couple of years there.

I was without a full time job for about a year, but was able to stay afloat running sound in a freelance capacity.  I was eventually able to get another IT job doing the same kinds of general stuff that I was doing while I was in college over 10 years ago, but they keep me part time so that they don't have to pay me any benefits (it's a state job).

I have pretty much divided my professional time between running sound (if you can actually find work in my area doing that, it pays minimum wage, and people don't even want to pay you that) and doing very general IT stuff that doesn't require a lot of specific knowledge.  I'm now 35 and not sure where to go from here... I have nothing saved for retirement, and my credit card bills are adding up.  I keep applying for jobs but rarely get an interview, and out of those I never get a job offer.  I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I'm not an idiot either.  I can learn almost anything I set my mind to, but most people my age have a specific skillset that they have honed by now that will get them good paying jobs, and I'm still basically doing entry level work.

I'm too broke and already have too many student loans to go back to school for another degree.  I know this is a really open ended and broad question, but does anyone have any suggestions for me?"
I’m miserable at my first job after college. Should I stick it out for awhile or look for something else?,"So I’ve been at the current company for less than a month. On the first day I just had this gut feeling that something wasn’t right. Communication seems to be an issue at the job. I wasn’t given any training on the different softwares the company uses or the role itself and on the first day I had to just dive into projects. My boss actually got really angry at me for not knowing as much. I suffered mild depression before and now I’m scared its going to make a come back. 

During meetings it’s like I just don’t exist, I’m a minority by the way. And I’ve been expected to work well over 10 hours. I feel like I don’t have enough knowledge to be tackling on projects so fast but I guess everyone feels that way with their first “real” job. I just feel like I’m failing right now and I’ve been thinking over is this career path really right for me. "
A co-worker called me unprofessional and insulted my intelligence. What do I do and how do I feel confident tomorrow?,"I am a recent university grad and I'm currently working at an office for a summer job before I start my post-grad in the fall. The majority of my team is in their 40s, and they often talk about their young kids and since starting I've found it hard to relate to them. They have placed in a cubicle far away from where everyone else sits, so it's made it more difficult for me to get to know them. Despite this, I've been pretty friendly.

Over the past few weeks, I've had a strong feeling that my co-workers have talked about me behind my back. Usually when I leave after asking them a question I hear them whispering. As an intern, I've also received very minimal work and I usually do one task a day or spend the day refreshing my email. When I ask if anything needs to be done, they say there's nothing I can do to help. Today, one of my co-workers gave a filing task. She didn't really explain what the files were. I arranged the files and put them in a folder not thinking much of it. About 30 minutes later she comes up to me, saying that my work looked unprofessional and that if I need help with filing and stapling things together to ask the receptionist because the receptionist is actually good at filing and completing the task. I think she could tell from my facial expressions that this comment hurt me, so she said it again.

For the last hour of the day, I felt really shitty. I felt really stupid as well. Earlier in the day before the incident happened, the same coworker asked me to email her a document, which I did, however she did not receive it. She made another co-worker watch me re-send the email to make sure I was ""doing it correctly"" (really? you don't think I can send an email correctly?) and for some odd reason the email went through.

I'm feeling a bit crappy about myself and my capabilities. At this point I'm a bit nervous about asking my co-workers for work/things to do because it feels like they think I'm stupid or socially inept. A lot of the tasks are so menial, so it feels like I can't even ""show"" them that I'm smart or a hard worker.

Advice?"
How Do I Choose My Career If I'm Not Passionate About Anything?,"I'm 16 and in high school that specifically focuses on mathematics and science. That means extra maths, computer science, and physics. I chose that high school because I wanted to push myself a bit. I have two more years to pass and then I get to decide on what faculty (or collage/uni) I'll choose.
I've been thinking of some paths but I realised that nothing really interests me deeply. I don't want to choose a career based solely on income. I don't want to feel miserable for the rest of my working life, either.
Does anyone relate and how did you choose your career paths?"
How to figure out your ideal job/career in your 30s?,"(Apologies for any formatting issues from mobile)

So a bit of background to understand where I’m at before I go into my big question:

-Located in NYC, USA

-Degree in economics (BA)

-Worked for the same company (Fortune 100 CPG/food goods company) since graduation - 8 years now

-Occupied several roles starting from customer service to sales operations to project management

-Current role is a project manager with a primary focus on process improvement and business operations projects, almost all strictly internal-facing and all strongly cross-departmental as I sit in a sales/commercial team

-Very safe company to work for with pretty good benefits (8/10) but the growth outlook and upward mobility is low

My main issue now is that I’m not happy in this PM role and I feel like every day I’m going to work just to burn 8 hours. My motivation for the role and the company’s mission is near zero. I keep find myself being pessimistic about everything and avoiding any participation during meetings so that I don’t take on any extra work or get assigned to any task forces. My project list is never ending and even if I worked at 110% efficiency the demands will never slow down. 

In terms of my work performance, prior to starting this role I had been a “rock star” employee, getting promoted every 18-24 months and taking on significant new responsibilities to help drive the customer service and sales operations teams toward supporting our sales goals. 18 months ago we restructured our department and in the reorganization the sales operations team was absorbed into another unit of the company that I had no interest in being a part of. I was offered this role of being a PM and leading the restructuring project but I was in way over my head and since the project involved a lot of sensitive HR points I was kept out of the loop of several key decisions from the executive level team and I was left trying to decipher why decisions were made that didn’t make any sense to me in terms of processes and personnel allocations. There were no other options for a next role at the time and I had a minor interest in being a PM so I accepted the assignment. 

Now we’re here and I hate the idea of working in this role any longer. The problem is that I don’t know what to do next. I’m not sure if I hate project management or just project management at my current company. I’m already studying for the PMP certificate since I feel it would help “close the chapter” on the past 18 months and I feel that would help show I accomplished something from this misery. In terms of other roles I’ve always liked the analytical side of my roles but I’m not sure if analytics is a role I would enjoy as the responsibilities vary from company to company. I’m also very uninterested in my current industry (consumer packages goods) and taking a leap to something more STEM related that I find interesting would be a challenge I’m assuming. To sum it up I’m confused about what to do next and get frustrated when I try to start the process of figuring this out. 

Where I need help is figuring out what to do next and what roles might be a good lead to start searching. I’ve read through the BoL resources and tried doing a few google searches on figuring out my “perfect” job but most of those quizzes either seem like junk or charge a fee to get results. If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d like to hear how you got thru this as well."
Bat Shit Plan: Go fully remote for US job and live in Central America to dramatically lower cost of living?,"Edit: after a a little constructive feedback I see this post is better in the expat digital nomad community as the cometary would be more well informed. Much of the feedback thus far can be used in a constructive way, much of it is... lacking. The main issue remains logging into work systems with an asset that would be located in a far way country. 

I could just say my mother sick and I need to move to rural America to take care of her. I’ll tell the US government her place is my address. Heck I’ll even throw some money her way every month for the favor(her health is fine). 

Then I’ll work remotely from panama. It’s in the same time zone so I can do virtual meetings as if I was in the USA assuming my WiFi is good. At first I can only stay 6 months but later I can get a better permit. 

I’m thinking there may be issues with my work laptop location, that’s the only hitch I can think of here. That might be solvable. 

Am I stupid or genius???

This could free up way more money for saving/investing yeah?"
What are low stress jobs in STEM?,"I recently graduated with an MS in food science and technology but I have an autoimmune disease (Graves’ disease) that I worry will make me unable to handle my fast-paced job in the future. 

I have some cognitive issues but I’m still able to work, just not as fast-paced and I cant handle stress like I used to. I have conceded that this might be my future. I’m tired a lot and would like a job where I can just go home and leave work at work. 

I have had two internships in the food industry (baked goods and candy) and experience in the lab and pilot plant, presenting, teaching, and mentoring. I also have statistical analysis experience in R though it’s not my strong suit. I mainly used Minitab, JMP, or Excel. I am familiar with principles of analytical chemistry, organic chemistry, food engineering, microbiology, dairy processing, and fermentation. 

Hopefully there’s a future for me since I worked really hard to get where I am just for my autoimmune disease to pop up and not respond to treatment."
Did you eventually realize a lot of people don’t know what their doing when it comes to a career?,"I’ve been kicking myself a lot lately. I left my first post college job after a year and a half, and if I’d only known then what I known now, I never would have left.

A lot of things happened last year and I was constantly comparing myself to my peers I graduated with. Everyone else seemed to find their dream job and things were moving along. Since the job I had wasn’t my “dream” job I was constantly looking for ways to get out of it.

The job I quit to go to was a very bad choice but at that time I thought I needed to do something different. I’m not joking when I say that job was terrible and I quit after a week. I got lucky that another company offered me a role the same week and I started shortly after. I’ve been at my newest job for about 4 months and I’ve still been regretting my decision. This job isn’t as bad as the last but it has its issues (poor management, lack of training, lack of benefits). Instead of having an actual role or career path, I’m just an office admin.

I wish I would have just went back to my old job after I quit my last after a week. I tried job searching again but I wasn’t liking any of the jobs in my area. I briefly considered becoming a teacher and took steps to get a teaching certificate but I realized I would not be a good fit dealing with kids all day. I went on multiple interviews and for jobs I thought I had a good chance with I was passed along with no interview offer. I was tried of the rejection and answering bs interview questions and bureaucracy, I missed my old company.

I sucked up my pride at the beginning of this month and asked my old boss from my first company if I could come back to work. She offered me my old job back and I am
going through the rehire process now. 

I felt embarrassed and besides from my immediate family knows I’m changing jobs  again and going back to my first company.

It was yesterday when I was scrolling through Facebook that I saw two separate people I graduated with posting about starting new jobs that were a complete 180 than what they started out doing. 

The first one was a girl who’d been with the same company almost 3 years if you count her internship experience. She’s now quit and working as a full time substitute teacher. The other was a guy who moved out of state after graduation and seemed to be a successful sales rep who moved back home. Initially he was going through the process to become a teacher but has now accepted a job as a vet tech at an animal hospital. 

It finally made me realize that a lot of people also have trouble deciding on a career, and especially in your early 20s you’ll make a lot of big decisions, regret some, benefit from others, etc. I’m feeling a little less ashamed at starting back at the same company but I know it’s whats best for me at the moment."
"Anyone quit their job, start a business, fail; and then attempt to go back to corporate? what was your experience like?","Just want to know what others experience was like. I actually was laid off, i didn't quit my job but I started a business unrelated to my current field of work, the business had some success but for external reasons I was forced to close the business. I am now trying to go back to corporate and I just started my job search so I am still very positive I can make it happen. Has anyone else been in this situation? What advice would you give me? For reference, I am in my 30s and the last time I worked in corporate was about 2 years ago."
"I am a 24-year-old Software Developer who is a bit lost on which career path to take. Has anyone else experienced this, and if you have, can you please give some advice on what to do?","I have been a software developer for the past 2-3 years now. I graduated with an IT degree, which had a mix of business, project management, and software development courses. 

I would say that I’m good at my job - always being able to deliver features that are done correctly and on time, I am client-facing on a daily basis, and I even help with managing/delegating tasks from our client to our team sometimes. 

I like software development, and I love technology, but I don’t want to be a “code monkey” forever. I would like to establish a career where I get to be more involved with the product that we build and the technologies behind it, without having to be the one dealing with the day-to-day implementations of it. I feel that the longer I wait to switch my career path, the deeper I go into being stuck as a developer forever.

Having been exposed to several business and project management courses, and with my software development experience, what would be the most logical next step for me?

For a while now, I’ve been stuck on the thought of getting either a Project Management certificate, or pursuing an MBA (with some sort of specialization in Technology). I’m still unsure if either one of these would lead me to a role or career that I feel I’d be more passionate about.

I would like to know if any of you on Reddit have been in a similar situation, and what it is that you decided to do for your career. I’m also wondering what you’d do if you were in my situation. Thank you so much!"
"Help! Any advice for me? Nearly 40, looking to start over.","Hello, reddit.  I'm here looking for as many people's opinions as I can get, and hopefully even some specific advice as to what I should do with my life.  I'll be 39 years old next month (seems like I was 25 yesterday), and it's time for me to make a big change.  My problem is, I have never had many interests that were a driving force or a passion in terms of career, and I have never had any particular skillset that is advanced enough to consider unique or particularly desirable to employers.  

A summarized description of my work history up to this point is as follows:

I started working at a very young age, and have always been a valued employee at any job I've ever had.  At around 21 years old I started working off the books running a coffee truck route in New York (where I currently reside).  I made a large amount of money doing that, but I was young, foolish, and of the mindset that the money train would never stop, so I spent wildly. Eventually, the business began to deteriorate due to many factors outside of my control, but it basically began a decline into obsolescence due to an industry wide refusal to change and adapt with the times.  I continued this job for 13 years.  That's 13 years of working completely off the books, without benefits or any form of retirement investments, as well as several years at the end which were rough enough financially to wipe out anything I had in savings at the time.  During those last years I did decide to go to college however, and I pursued a bachelors in psychology.  I naively took loans out every semester, and never graduated.  In fact I dropped out with just one course left to complete my degree program.  My current job, which I've had since the end of my stint as a coffee truck driver, is in the marine transportation industry.  I got the job, with no background in the field, via the recommendation of a friend.  The job pays very well for someone without a degree (over 100k), and I've managed to learn quite a bit in the 4 years I've been here.  My problem is, I don't like it, and I feel it's not going to last.  Not going to last for several reasons, including but not limited to the fact that the company may actually fold within the coming year due to an astoundingly bad couple of years marred with incidents and loss of business.  I should also mention that my time here doesn't really qualify me for work in the same field with different companies, because it's very specific to this particular company.  In addition, the pay for comparable jobs at similar companies pay about half of what I'm making now.   I'm trying to come up with a ""what next"" plan and I'm really struggling.


I feel I'm a very competent person, and I don't feel limited by my ability to learn any new job/skill.  But I'm almost 40.  I need a job that pays well, and that I'm interested in enough to want to stay for good.  I would also ideally like to find a job which allows me the flexibility to travel (I've held jobs for my entire life that have been extremely inflexible in terms of taking days off), but I understand that I can't make that priority number one.  I should mention that although I am swimming in student debt, I would consider going back to school (for no longer than 2 years), if the resulting potential job paid well enough for me to live comfortably and pay off my debt.  As I've said, my interests are varied and I do feel confident that I could learn most anything, but if it means anything at all I've always been incredibly fascinated by insects, traveling, plants and animals. I am also open to moving almost anywhere, including out of the country if that's what it takes. 


Thanks for listening, reddit.  Hope that all came across as intended.  "
