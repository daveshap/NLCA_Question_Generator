Stop stringing people along just for sex. If you want casual sex go after someone who wants that’s too.,I’m so tired of(some) guys knowing all they want is casual sex but stringing someone along who they know doesn’t want that because it’s been communicated before. There are plenty of girls out there that are looking for casual sex or fwb go find one of them. It’s really sad to deceive someone by making them think you want something more when you don’t it’s not fair to the person and honestly your wasting both of your time. Please guys that are doing this stop. It’s hurtful and manipulative. I’m not saying all guys do this but a lot do.
How to be an attractive guy.,"All of this advice on ""how to read women"" and ""what to do/say"" is bs. Social ""intelligence"" and body language are two very idiotic concepts because those rarely come innate and are very hard to control. This is why us guys stress ""say what you want"" because social ""cues"" are purposely misleading and cause misunderstandings more than not. And yet most women *still* rely on them more than verbal cues. 

It took me 10 years to ""learn"" social norms and cues, and how to portray confidence. I've read every ""pick up"" and ""how to date/be attractive to women"" book and article there is. From ones written by Red Pill misogynists to ones written by hardcore feminists/misandrists. I've spent hours and hours reading and practicing. I've bought lesson after lesson.

**It's all a waste of time.** 

If you're putting that much effort into being attractive, *no one* will find you attractive. 

The best thing I learned after all this time is to sit down and really figure out if I like myself. If you do this and you don't like yourself, figure out what you don't like and change it. *Self-Love is the most important love you can have.* Self-love comes before *everyone else* besides your children. You cannot love someone else, til you love yourself. 

Once you love who you are, spend every day focused on what *you* want. Ignore every woman unless she's a part of your life. Think of it like this: as a straight man, when other random men pass by, how do you view them? You don't. You don't care. They could be invisible. 

Yet when a random cute girl passes by she immediately occupies all the space in your brain. 

And she's literally done nothing but have a good bone structure and probably some meat on her body. Big whoop.

As a man you are *going* to learn this someday in life: The most gorgeous super model in the world still takes shits everyday just like you. Stop putting them on a pedestal and hiding your emotions. If you're on a date and there's a silence and she seems bored, ask yourself are you bored? Is she entertaining you? Is she making you laugh? No? Then why are you so concerned about entertaining her? No matter what our media portrays, it is not your job to entertain women. 

Focus on yourself and making sure you're having a good time. Focus on your life and make sure *you're* having fun. I'm not saying be a complete asshole. You should always care about people, but **not** more than you care about yourself. I've gotten so much attention from women by focusing on myself versus when I used to try and focus on them. 

So that's my advice."
RANT: Dating as a woman is NOT easier. Finding love as a woman is NOT easier. Finding sex is. It's not the same. We are just as lonely.,"I'm part of the foreveralone subreddit because I haven't had a serious relationship in 5 years. Yet, none of the posts there describe me, and if I were to ever post anything, they'd chew me up so fast: I'm a woman, objectively physically attractive, it's very easy for me to get ""dates."" As a result, I'm not ""forever alone"" because people want to go on dates with me, right? Right?

Sure, let's agree that women, in particular, steoreotypically attractive women (young, fit), can get dates. Sure. Ok.

But number of matches in tinder does not equal love. Guys buying you drinks does not equal love. Guys sleeping with you and then GHOSTING you does not equal love. Guys leading you on and breadcrumbing you for WEEKS or even MONTHS  is not love.

And little tiny scraps of attention here and there, or even sexual interest, does not, in any way, somehow quench our loneliness.

We are still lonely. I'm still lonely.

Yes women can be lonely. Pretty women can be lonely. Women can be surrounded by the ""attention"" of 20 men and STILL be lonely. Hint: because more often than not, it's not real attention. It's fleeting, momentary, empty, and baseless. It will be gone. Very soon. Maybe by the night's end.

I'm just so exhausted of my feelings of loneliness being dismissed over and over. As if I didn't have a right to feel lonely or sad. Here's a list of all the guys I've ""dated"" over the past 5 years:

\- Guy that was gonna move to Asia in 3 months. Said he loved me deeply while simultaneously keeping a girl in Asia ""warm"" for when he got there. When I complained he explained that he was being logical, as he was gonna move there soon, he needed to keep his options open.

\- Guy who wooed me and made me laugh for weeks and then months only for me to discover he had a LIVE IN GIRLFRIEND back in his home country all along. Texts me that he misses me to this day.

\- Guy that i was crazy about that would generously grace me with his presence for 1 HOUR A WEEK for MONTHS. When I spoke up about it he said that was all he could do. Take it or leave. I took it. Even though I cried for the other 6 days every week.

\- Guy that slept with me for 1 entire year, gave me an orgasm ONE TIME in that year, and when I spoke to him about it, said it was my fault. After a weekend full of sex in which he came 6 times and I came 0 and I begged him to please try he accused me of rape. Said I was forcing him. I stopped talking to him. A month later he showed up at my house again, said he treated me so harsh because deep down he thought I was a ""bad person"" but that he (and i quote his exact words) ""still want to fuck"" me.

Those are the long term guys. In-between, I've had several other short-term ones, including the guy I went on 2 horrible dates with, was thoroughly confused when he kept on asking me out (we had no chemistry) and then ended up literally BLOCKING ME as soon as he slept with me and then disappeared. Or the guy who showered me with promises of fun date after fun date after fun date, only to completely disappear in a couple weeks too. But not block me or ghost me no- just string me along whenever I ask, make sure I'm kept warm in the repertoire.

I'm tired of being used as a sexual commodity, I'm tired of having my feelings played with. I want love. Real love. I'm so ready and willing to commit to one man only, to build a family, to build a life. I'm ready to give a man my all. But somehow because I can ""get dates"" easily is like Im not entitled to feeling lonely, to feeling unwanted. But how can I not feel unwanted when the last time I heard the words ""i love you"" were 5 years ago?

/rant ends here

EDIT 1: WOW THIS BLEW UP!!! Thanks for the Silver and 2 Awards!! Thank you so much for the kind comments, messages, and even chats I've received. My inbox is very full right now, I'm trying to get back to everyone. A few thoughts:

1. I was both glad/sad to read SOOO many women's comments with the \*exact same\* experience as me. Glad that we were able to find each other and provide support, yet sad that so many of us exist and are stuck in this conundrum.
2. I was also very pleasantly surprised and touched by how many men reached out in kindness and understanding! Even though men have a different experience when it comes to dating and romance, most men were able to put themselves in women's shoes for a moment and understand, even if for just a little bit, what our experience is like here on the other side, and how we can be just as lonely.
3. There were also very, very few (maybe 5 compared to the 2,300 that upvoted?) people that reached out, all men, with actual harassment and threats of physical violence. To those people I will not respond, but I actually wish them love and kindness. I've clearly had bad experiences in dating but yet, I don't hate men. Not one bit. It's the opposite: I am actively looking for 1 man I can give my heart and soul to, and try to find this man, over and over again. Yet, these \~5 or so men that contacted me with violence, do hate women. To them, I wish their souls are healed. You can never find love with so much hate in your heart.
4. Finally, to all men and women, gay, straight, bi, pan, or any other sexual orientation, that commented with similar feelings of loneliness and a deep desire to find love: I wish all of us good fortune. I hope we all find what we are looking for."
A tinder story,"A few years ago, my girlfriend dumped me for another guy. I felt heartbroken. I’m not a very emotional person but I was crying for a whole day. I didn’t know what to do. I eventually re downloaded tinder. I got a few compliments and dates but nothing special and I felt like giving up. But then I saw this one girl. There was something different about her. 

She was everything I ever wanted. Smart, cute, athletic, motivated, helpful. She wasn’t like the ten gals that want to be stay at home moms and eat Cheetos all day long (no offense to any sahm) that I just swiped left on. I swiped right on her and I kept checking my phone for a notification. A few hours later she matched with me and we messaged back and forth for hours. She agreed to go out on a date. 

I was hit with nerves about everything. I freaking wore a red flannel shirt, ripped dark blue jeans, and black leather boots. I got a bottle of wine and spilt it everywhere. I thought it was done but she felt different. She viewed me as genuine. 

After a few more dates (that we’re also much better), we began dating. We got higher paying jobs and eventually moved in together. She has been my world for the past three years. Even if it’s just reading and drinking coffee on a rainy day, the view of her makes me feel the sun start shining. Tomorrow she planned a date at the original restaurant where we met for our three year anniversary. 

Tomorrow I will also be proposing. 

I felt lost and alone but I would feel like that all again if it meant I have her in my life. I am super happy to have gotten her father’s blessing, as it means I get to possibly have her in the rest of my life. Don’t give up. To everyone, I hope y’all get what you want."
Corona virus has a surprising benefit in dating,"So I live in South Korea.  Here, nowadays, you rarely see anyone’s face because everyone wears a face mask.

So I matched with this guy on a dating app.  He’s a pizza maker/delivery boy about a 5 minutes walk from my apartment.  Probably have seen him a few times even.  But I thought he was cute in his profile, and moreover goofy, which is 100% my style

We had a plan to meet up later this week for the first time but today after work he texted me saying he just got off work and wanted to see (just my face!!) for a second.

I decided to be spontaneous and go, no makeup and leisure clothes in all.  I came out, and we immediately started going for a walk (masks on).

We ended up walking and talking and joking and holding hands for two hours.  (Don’t worry korea isn’t quarantined, my area is small and there was literally no one around) His profile only had one picture, so I wasn’t sure exactly what he looked like.  By the end of it, i realized I only saw his eyes the entire time.  I mentioned it.  But at the same time, I felt like it really didn’t matter.

The whole time we didn’t have to worry about appearances, just talk and have fun

Not going to lie, it was kind of nice.  Thanks corona for this new face-free dating experience~ we will see each other again in 2 days :)"
NEVER. STOP. HITTING. ON. YOUR. SIGNIFICANT. OTHER.,"doesn’t matter how big or small, don’t stop- everyone loves that stuff. they deserve to be hyped up and known that they’re loved by you, go shoutout your man (or woman) and show them off"
Does anyone feel like they hate dating because you basically have to re-explain yourself to every new person?,Its like an author re-writing an entire book from scratch
Do you ever wonder what the person you're going to end up with is doing?,"Whenever I feel sad, alone, or frustrated, I think about him. I wonder where he is and what he's doing. I wonder if he's in a relationship right now. I wonder if he's happy or if he's miserable. I wonder if he wonders about me too. I think about how much I wish he were here with me and how I can't wait to finally meet him. I think about how all this bullshit will have been worth it if it's what leads me to him.

But sometimes I wonder if he even exists at all, or if he will forever remain a product of my imagination."
Single but not using online dating?,"Upvote if you're single, open to the possibility of dating, but not using online dating apps. Would love to know the stats"
I'll tell you what a woman wants.,"She wants you to drag her to the bedroom, toss her down, and do the dishes while she takes a fucking nap."
If you can’t take 3 months without dating you have a problem,I’m seeing far too many posts on this sub about people going crazy because they aren’t able to meet up with people. Even worse I’m seeing people break lockdown to go on dates. This isn’t normal behaviour. You’d rather get a virus than be single for a few months? Maybe you should take this time to consider why you’re afraid of your company.
I have a confession to make,"My boyfriend's favorite thing in the world is to tell stories, so sometimes when he references one of them I tell him he's never told me that one even if he has. He gets really passionate about it and i like hearing him talk."
A quick note on phone use,"This past weekend, my (23F) boyfriend (23M) of a few months and I went for a little getaway at my family's cabin, just the two of us. It was all wonderful, but what I want to point out as oddly amazing to me was how little he used his phone.
We got there and I grabbed his phone to take a picture, and I asked why his brightness was so low. He said it was because he forgot his charger, and I told him he should have said something when we swung by my place on our way out (our phones have different chargers, but I do have one that would have worked for him). He shrugged it off very casually and said ""I don't plan on using it anyways, I'm here with you.""
I didn't realize how sweet of a gesture it was until he said it. For the rest of the weekend we would go on a walk, for example, and he would never take his phone. He focused on me and us.

Just thought I'd share that those little things really prove you're paying attention and show where your priorities are!"
I’m just gonna say it. If you think it’s “ghosting” when someone stops messaging you and you haven’t even met in person... you’re not ready for online dating.,"Actively dating and seeing someone for months and then they disappear is ghosting.

Here’s the definition of ghosting - 
The practice of ending a personal relationship with someone by suddenly and without explanation withdrawing from all communication."
"Movie, then dinner. Not dinner and a movie.","Everyone always says ""dinner and a movie"" but that's not a good plan, especially if neither of you are good at starting conversation. 

Think about it. You go to dinner, have awkward conversation over a meal, then sit quietly in a movie before going home.

Go to the movie first, and you have an immediate icebreaker. The movie. Get conversation going, and it's easier to jump into the about you kinda stuff. Not only that, but the last thing your date will remember is the fun conversation and good meal you just had.

Thank you for coming to my talk.

EDIT: So I see a lot of reasons why dinner and a movie are a bad thing, mainly ""You can't get to know each other during the movie,"" but in part that's the point.

Talking to people is a skill, and not everyone is good at it. To everyone suggesting this where it is you, the other person, and basically nothing else, I think you're missing this point. The movie first is meant to give you an entire movie with of things you can talk about to get the conversation started.

For the people saying ""dinner first, in case they're a creep so you can leave"" you can leave during a movie too. But awkwardness in conversation can be taken as creepy even if it's just a lack of knowledge on how to have a conversation.

To those saying I forgot the word ""Ted"" I know :p it was on purpose."
Having someone who wants to spend time with you is so underrated,"This might sound totally obvious, but it's so nice when you meet someone who actually messages/calls you first. And wants to spend time together. I don't like to always be the one trying to initiate seeing one another. A simple ""want to hang out?"" from a girl and then like actually spending a good amount of time together without feeling like either one of you wants/has to leave.

I don't know. In my experience as a guy I've often been the one to ask someone if they want to hang out it feels like. Not always but pretty often I think. And it's nice when someone else expresses interest in you.

I think that I had specific memories as a kid/teenager when there were times when I got blown off or ended up by myself somewhere or something? Idk? All I know is that when someone expresses interest in talking to me and seeing me it brings out the best in me and makes me feel so good."
I (24F) just love how my boyfriend (27M) says ‘we’ all the time,"I think my friends are probably sick of hearing how much I love my boyfriend, but I honestly think he is the sweetest person in the world. Over the weekend we went on a road trip to his hometown with some friends and I noticed something that made me so happy. Whenever my boyfriend talks about his future, he always says ‘we’ he might be talking about something simple like next weekends plans or something more serious like his next house, but he’ll always say ‘yeah *we’re* free next weekend’ or ‘maybe *we* could live in ___’. I love the way he does it as it makes me feel so important and loved. 

While we were away, we had a bonfire and were all sitting outside drinking. I got tired and decided to go to bed, leaving my boyfriend outside with my friend. The next morning she pulled me aside to tell me how sweet he is and that he was absolutely gushing about how much he loves me and told her how he really wants to get engaged next year and adores me so much...it made my heart melt knowing how serious he is about me and how badly he wants our future together. 

I truly think I’m the luckiest girl in the world, he is so perfect in every single way and I can’t wait for our future together"
i really miss being excited about someone,ever feel like you got so much love to give but no one to give it to?
I’m so fucking sick of the “let’s see what happens” culture in modern dating. This is just an excuse to avoid trying. Do you disagree?,"I don’t know what happened to my generation, but somewhere along the line, I feel we lost touch with reality. Maybe it was online dating where you can shop for the ‘perfect’ partner or get instant gratification with a quick hook up. Maybe it was the rising divorce rates that make us feel love rarely ever even succeeds so what chance do we have anyway? Maybe it’s the ‘perfect life’ effect caused by social media. We see all of our friend’s successes, but none of their struggles so when we ourselves struggle it makes us feel isolated like we must be weak or shitty humans to not have achieved X, Y, or Z. Maybe it was Disney showing us that the relationships we’ve been waiting for will just sweep us off our feet effortlessly and without any intervention from us…it will just be fate.

I understand why you’d want to just see where it goes – it takes all of the pressure and responsibility off you. I mean, if you don’t try, you won’t be disappointed if it fails. If you don’t care in the first place, you won’t be hurt when it ends. If you don’t make yourself vulnerable and try to establish a real connection with someone, you can’t be taken advantage of or get rejected. Besides, when the ‘perfect person’ eventually does come along, it will feel so breezy and effortless you’ll know you’ve found them, right?

**FUCKING. WRONG.**

This is how you end up alone. It boggles my brain how people think that success just falls into your lap. Do you think that a strong marriage and happy family is going to ‘just happen’? I get that timing-wise things happen when they happen – but if you don’t create an environment that fosters the chance at that opportunity, it’s not just going to appear. Do you think if plant seeds in May but never water them that you’ll be eating fresh produce all summer and fall long? No! You might get a nubby cucumber here and there but you won’t be enjoying a bounty (this analogy means two things :P ).

I teach programming and I see this with students all the time. Some come into the class because they have to take it for their major but they are intimidated by its reputation for difficulty and they lack confidence; essentially, they expect to fail. So what do most of them do? Well, you’d think they would come to see me during office hours or get help from our tutoring center. They might read the textbook and take notes or watch YouTube videos for extra perspectives on the concepts…nope. Nope, nope, nope. They expect to fail so they barely try…and then they fail.

Just like my students, the same outcome will occur with dating. I feel my generation has given up hope and given up trying; this just further perpetuates the issue and reinforces our already harmful beliefs.

You get things in your life by taking ownership of your goal, pursuing it, and working hard to make it happen. I don’t just hand out A’s in my class and happy, healthy, strong relationships don’t just happen – to achieve either of those things, it takes work. Every day, you have to go out there and water your garden. If you don’t, how do you ever expect to have a harvest?

*Sigh*. Okay, I'm done. Thanks for listening."
When you’re messaging someone and you don’t have time to reply for a few minutes so they message you “?” or “hello?” is so annoying and is such a huge turn off.,"Like I get they might be eager to talk, but it comes off as desperate and clingy. Generally this happens when we just started talking too. 

Does anyone else feel similarly?"
I miss intimacy,"Kissing for the sake of kissing, making eye contact over a cup of coffee, sharing a joke, flirty touches. I miss all of these so much but at the same time I haven’t really met a guy that I’m interested in. I guess I’m feeling a little lonely but reluctant to date for the sake of dating. It’s cold here and I tempted to give in to online dating but sometimes a one night stand or FWB can make people feel lonelier than actually being alone. The frustration is real!

Edit: Reading all your comments made me feel a little less lonely. I know my time will come but honest to god, I wish my time will just arrive right now."
Don't invest in someone based off of how much you like them. Invest in them based off of how much they invest in YOU.,"Don't let your investment into someone become a reflection of how much you like them; let how much someone is invested in you become a reflection of how much you should invest into them.

Edit: I'm seeing some people take this out of context so let me explain. I'm not saying to just sit back and let the other person do all the work. Of course sometimes you have to take the risk to invest into someone to see if something will pan out or not. But if you are starting to show interest into someone and they aren't reciprocating the same level of investment as you big or small, move on. They don't deserve YOU. 

Know what your core needs are. Know your standards."
Girlfriend just asked if I was ok with being in an open relationship.,"I told her no, and when she asked why I told her because she will be fucking other guys, and she replied with “oh it won’t be that many”....

Right now I am feeling like I should 100% shut her out of my life now.

EDIT: Wow this post definitely blew up within a short amount of time...
Thanks everyone for commenting on this post and I will try to respond to everyone.

EDIT 2: Today we broke up and I took my self off of her phone plan. 
I wished her to be happy and she threw insults and plead towards me."
General dating tip: If you are single and looking to date instead of spending $700+ on new IPhone every 1 or 2 years use half of that money on clothes that fit you.,No one will judge for having an older phone but people do value more how you look/dress and $350 on clothes go a long way
"until you get comfortable with being alone , you’ll never know if you’re choosing someone out of love or loneliness",“Her/his happens is not your responsibility. she/he should be happy and you should be happy as an individual... then we come together and  share our happiness... giving someone a responsibility to make you happy when you can’t do it for yourself is selfish” -
It is seriously like quite common to never have had sex. Even in your thirties. Even for medical students. I almost killed myself multiple times over that shit. So stupid,"We seriously need to do a MUCH better job of normalizing people that have never had sex. Because it is starting to become clear to me that it IS very much NORMAL. A LOT of people are just scared to admit that they’re still a virgin. It’s not exactly something people like to mention first thing when they meet someone. Or ever for that matter.

Edit: And people downvoting this can fuck right off. Killing your narrative, eh? Cause that’s what it is. And I could be dead right now because of it. I came pretty damn close

Edit 2:

https://imgur.com/a/7yFDOpn

Some polls I did on reddit mostly on r/polls recently really opened up my eyes to the possibility that a lot of redditors really have not had sex yet regardless of age. There are multiple problems with these polls mostly related to how representative redditors in these subs are of the general population. Also, some polls are misleading if you don’t take into account differences in age and gender (these differences had to be taken separately). Still, the results were so pronounced that I could not help but be moved by them. I got decent or good sample sizes for most categories. Head’s up though: there are some weird effects there too (idk wtf is going on with the results from younger age groups). Honesty and/or confusion could be factoring in too I guess.

Uploading the charts image to imgur has been leading to some fuzziness. Sorry. If you open within the reddit app you can’t see anything. If you open in the imgur app it’s clear.

Edit 3: I get it’s problematic to try to say redditors represent the general population when they clearly don’t. I’m not saying they do. This was a survey of the participants at the subs I used. That’s it. Getting data on this subject is problematic and controversial anyway. Most of what we get fed is probably skewed the other way however because people in the general population are probably more reluctant to offer if they’re part of a stigmatized population unless it is 100% anonymous. And anonymous platforms tend to not be representative of the general population for one reason or another. I think it’s a problem. Collecting data from health records is pretty terrible too if you think of it. How often are people really telling the doctor or nurse the truth in these situations? Probably not very often. So, yes the real numbers are going to be way lower in the general population than my numbers. But maybe it was good to see things from a population skewed the other way than what we are used to. My experience with social pressure and isolation in these circumstances was ridiculous. I know this is a huge problem. I’ve lived it."
I finally kissed him,"I met this guy (22) during the winter at my (22f) part-time job that I've worked at over breaks ever since I was 16. I come back when I'm home from college. We started hanging out more and I told him I liked him, which he replied that he did too. We went on 2 dates, but we are both really shy, so we just held hands. Today after work, my best friend (who works at the same part-time job as me) made a small graduation celebration today at the park since I graduated via email at 10am this morning haha. After eating and playing games, we went our separate ways except for the guy and me. We stood outside in the cold for what must have been 20 or 30 minutes just making stupid jokes. He made sure my car started since it wouldn't start when I left work before. He stood at my door and I made a small stupid joke about me being short. Then I said ""if I weren't so short I would try to kiss you."" Then he kissed me.

I've gone on dates before, but have never liked a guy the way I like this one. I was never the one who tried to kiss first since I'm so shy, but I could tell we both wanted to and he's too polite to make sudden moves which is another thing I really like about him. The guys I've dated before were huge jerks and did not respect my boundaries like he does. I've wanted to kiss him for a while and it finally happened. This was the best graduation day."
I've started calling out guys who ghost me and I've never felt better,"It started when I went on a date with a guy from my gym. He was really attractive, honestly I thought he was a little out of my league. Or maybe he didn't think it was a date (we did meet on Hinge though) but he invited me to meet up at the gym again later via text, and when I pitched dinner or drinks instead, he went silent. Honestly, I'm so sick of that shit. We had friendly interactions and worse, we were likely to see each other again at the gym - not so with Covid but I didn't know that at the time.

In the past I'd've seen this guy around the gym after being ghosted and I would have been embarrassed and felt ashamed, but this time something shifted in me. He's the one who should be embarrassed! How hard is it to say no thank you!So, the next day I politely did it for him. I said something along the lines of:""I'll take the silence to mean you'd rather just be buds. Totally understand.""

By phrasing it out for him it made it easier, so he responded with a confirmation ""yes, just down to climb as friends"" and an apology for not answering sooner. But I didn't leave it there, I added ""Hey, I get it, rejecting people sucks. but on the receiving end it feels better when you use your words, and it makes it less awkward when we see each other around the gym."" He apologized again, and I made it clear we were cool, and it seemed like he left that conversation happier than just ghosting me and I left it happier too feeling like I got a respectful answer and I could see that he didn't actually have such disdain for my invitation or think I'm repulsive etc. And maybe I didn't owe him the kindness, but it felt good to think that with that conversation, maybe he won't ghost girls in the future. Maybe he'll remember what I pointed out, that it's so much more hurtful to have someone you had a nice time with just go silent as opposed to kindly expressing that they're not interested.

Anyway, it's happening again, with a casual hookup this time, and I intend to voice my feelings again. I'm not going to let these guys ignore the fact that I am a person who should be treated with respect. If you date someone or sleep with them, you owe them the respect of a polite response instead of the silent treatment. You don't even have to give a reason, but that dread of sitting around, waiting for an answer, slowly realizing they aren't into you and don't even respect you enough to say so - I'm not taking it anymore. I don't think I've dated assholes, just cowards, and when offered an out they'd probably rather take that out than just go ghost.

So I'm going to be polite and understanding, but I'm going to let people know that it's hurtful and that they should be better. And maybe it'll be a little ripple effect of positivity on the dating scene in my city. And instead of just feeling bad I suggest other people try it too - it feels kind of powerful honestly.

Edit/Update: Despite a lot of people not liking this advice, I had another really positive interaction. I just let him know that I hoped if he didn’t want to hook up again he’d say so and not ghost, which gave him an opportunity to say that he doesn’t and for me to say that I understand, the worlds crazy right now etc. He answered after that and was genuinely kind and I feel like we closed out on much better terms than if I’d just “let it be” or accepted that I’m not owed anything and that’s how it is. Now he doesn’t feel guilty and I am not sitting around, checking my phone, wondering if I’m being ghosted, etc. That dread of not knowing sucks and now we ended on good terms and I don’t have to sit through it. Maybe my approach isn't for everyone but I think it was good for me and my ex-hookup in this case."
chicks chasing me,"So I got chased by a chicken on my bike yesterday.... At least I can say I have some chicks chasing me right?

&#x200B;

Edit: so i realize this may be in the wrong sub but I think it might be a breath of fresh air to people coming here about being ghosted, rejected, or overthinking things... The big thing is just do you itll come together in time.   I mean I'm in the same boat but after this happening and the irony behind it, I just had to share."
A reminder for myself and anyone else who needs it:,"If they really want to be with you, they will:

• Reply to your text in a timely manner 

• Text you first/again if they don’t hear from you

• Take the effort to make plans to spend time with you

• Ask about your day/care how you’re doing 

I think sometimes we (myself included) make too many excuses for the actions of others. We all have busy days/different ways of communicating but let’s be real, it takes 1 minute to draft a text and less time than that to put effort into showing you care for someone. You deserve that effort"
"Met the cutest girl on a plane today and got her number, had to share the story with someone","I was flying home from CA and met this super cute girl while walking down the ramp to our plane. She's a biology student in Idaho with gorgeous eyes, a sweet smile, and frankly just stunning from head to toe. After only a few minutes we found several things we had in common, and I even got her to laugh a couple times. She ended up sitting way behind me on the plane but I really wanted to see if I could get her number. So I ripped out a page from the in-flight magazine and wrote her a note that said:

*As a scientist I'm wondering if you'd be willing to help me with a survey. I'm trying to find the best way to get the number of a cute girl I met on a plane (just in case I'm ever in southern Idaho) and wondering if a note is effective. If you would like to participate, would you be willing to rank its effectiveness on a scale of (000) 000-0000 to (999) 999-9999? For science. You can submit your survey by folding this piece of paper and leaving it in the storage door below the mirror in the bathroom behind you. If not, no worries and safe travels. :)*

So I take this note and walk back to the bathrooms on the plane, and as I'm making my way back to my seat I lean over to her and say ""I'm sorry, I think you dropped this"" and walk back to my seat. The flight had about another 90 minutes before landing, so I tried to wait toward the end of the flight and made my way back again. She had her eyes closed listening to music as I passed so I didn't get to see her, but sure enough I walked into the bathroom and her note was there! It said:

*My scientific curiosity is piqued! I'm happy to respond to your survey, as I always enjoy meeting new people. Oh, and my name is \_\_\_\_\_ by the way...""* WITH HER NUMBER!

She even kept my original note to her, hopefully because it was memorable? I can't believe it actually worked.

Also, here's how much I \*do not\* have game...I was so excited that I accidentally left the note in the goddamn bathroom! \*facepalm\* I got back to my seat, realized what I'd done, and practically sprinted to the back of the plane. A woman got out and took one look at my face and I knew that she knew. Haha, her face said it all. I said ""did I leave a piece of paper in here?"" and she said ""yes, I just threw it in the trash."" So there I am digging through the wet paper towels in the trash can like a goddamn maniac trying to find this note...I've got a couple people waiting for a bathroom poking their head around the door to see what's up, a flight attendant is asking me if I want gloves...but I found it! It was wet and a corner got ripped while I was digging but I'll be damned if I didn't get it.

So yeah, MT if you're reading this, you made my day. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did :)"
RCMP saved my embarassing butt after a tinder date,"So I went to a tinder date's condo recently. He came down and to get me so I didn't have to buzz to get in (i.e., fob to get into building and elevator). 

We had dinner and got into it. Now, we realized we weren't a match so after we were done and the alcohol leaves my system, I was hoping to leave without waking him or any pleasantries. I did exactly that. 

Once I got to my car I realized I FORGOT MY PHONE. My phone with my driver's license, credit card, and more importantly, Google map to get me home!  It was 2:30am at this point and I was going through the directory at his building to find his name but couldn't find it. 

I didn't know his last name. I didn't know his buzzer code. I couldn't get back upstairs, I couldn't drive, and I did not have the direction to go home. 

Thankfully, the RCMP (royal Canadian mounted police) station was across the street so I had the most dignified walk of shame to the police. After explaining the situation, one of them just went into the station to get the master fob to the building so I can knock on my date's door instead of getting a full report... Since it was clearly embarrassing and I didn't know my date all that well for them to look him up...

The officers were super nice about it. One of them reassured me that they face different situations everyday and that as long as I was safe and could get home, he was happy. The other officer made me feel better by saying at least now I can have a great tinder story plus a potentially good online review after I get my phone back to tell the world how the RCMP really did serve the community that night. 

The best part was, once they got me into the building and up the elevator, they hid in the corner so my tinder wouldn't see them when he opened the door in his boxers. 

Let me just publicly praise the Coquitlam RCMP pair who got me through a tough and awkward night. Thank you for protecting and serving last night. I've never felt more safe and part of the community than I did last night when tinder opened the door.

Tldr: I left my phone at tinder date, didn't know how to contact him so the police helped out. I got my phone back with a great little tinder story.

"New favourite rejection line is ""I'm not used to dating someone as emotionally available as you""","After over 6 weeks of dating someone who didn't appear to have any red flags, who shared common values with me, who wanted the same things in the future, who bonded with me intellectually and emotionally, who saw me a few times a week and slept in my bed... I asked the question;

""Are you happy with how things are going?""

Down it spiralled, starting with ""I'm still figuring things out"" and ending up with the vague ""I'm not feeling 100% about you and don't want to hold you back"". He finished off with the line above, bear in mind this man is 36. 

Kudos to me for asking before I invested more.

But wow it still feels like another kick in the teeth."
Is this r/dating or r/Rant?,"Jesus. What is wrong with this subreddit? All the time I see posts about OLD, how men want only sex, how women have it easy on OLD, how unhappy you are that you are single.. will you cut it out?

No, posting here for the 1001th that ghosting sucks will not make people stop ghosting. Its part of the package of OLD and it will never stop. EVER. Same goes for hookups and ego boosters.

Here's one tip of advice for you: If you are not ready to be ghosted or have people wanting only sex, then you are not ready to use OLD. It is ok to not use OLD. But if you want to play the game, those are part of it.

Also, honest piece of advice for so many people here complaining that they are so unhappy single. If you are unhappy alone, chances are you will be unhappy with someone too. Your happiness is not the responsibility of anyone else but yourself. Get your shit together instead of hoping someone will fix you."
r/Dating is NOT the place to soapbox Incel/Blackpill rhetoric.,"*I didn't want to have to create this post but unfortunately with the direction I've seen this sub go I'm forced to say my piece.*

There has been a slow and steady influx of unwanted soap-boxing plaguing our boards over the last year or so. I don't think this is a surprise to any of you all. While we ultimately encourage healthy discussion around both the positives and negatives of dating the overall spirit of this sub has been lost. Many of our readers have expressed their concern to our moderation team and we honestly feel the same way.

Our ""No Soap-boxing or Promoting an Agenda"" rule has always been on the sidebar for our users to see but I want to stress our current stance on the topic. **Soap-boxing will and has always included black-pill ideology and the subset of vocabulary that comes with it.** 

This means that using our board to preach about how there is no hope for men (or women) who are conventionally unattractive is unwanted and will be removed. Using our board to discuss how you think women are shallow and will only choose the top percentage of men is unwanted and will be removed. Even just a mention of the term ""Chad"" is unwanted and will be removed.

We can sympathize that dating is difficult and is even more difficult for people that might not be the prettiest. It's no secret to anyone. What we value though is genuine discussion and helping those who actually want and need it. The countless misogynistic threads about how women and society aren't fair to men are toxic and don't do anyone any favors. There are better subreddits that would love to discuss these types of things with you. 

At the end of the day let's lift each other up. Let's share our experiences and learn and/or laugh from them! Ask the questions that need to be asked. But let's not lose site of what dating is really about.

**EDIT: If you do see any rule breaking behavior please report so that we can take action. It's hard to see every comment. Thanks!**"
Would you use a dating app where you need to listen to a 15 minute podcast of a person before being able to message them?,"I am creating a new dating app primarily for people looking for serious relationships.

Each profile you see on the app would have a verified picture and a 15 minute audio (recorded in an engaging format suggested by the app).

EDIT: **You will be able to message the user after you listen to atleast 5 minutes of their audio**. (There is no need to match). However it will be communicated to the other user how much of the conversation you have listen to (to incentivise people who put in more effort)

If you don't like a person, at any point, you can skip them immediately. 

The primary assumptions is that
  1. Audio recordings convey so much more about a person than a text based profile.
  2. You might take the other person more seriously if you know that they spent between 5 to 15 minutes listening to you before messaging you.

One of the format I picked to be used is '36 questions that can make you fall in love'. The idea is to give a structure that makes it very easy to create a profile. Of course only have to answer the questions that you are comfortable answering.

Just to give an idea about the '36 questions' format, they start with lighter ones and go deeper as you progress. Here are some examples. 

Q1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?

Q5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?

Q10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?

Q13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?

Q23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other people’s?

Q30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?


Would love to hear your thoughts :)

PS: When I spoke to my friends for feedback, the responses varied quite a bit based on gender. So it will help if you share your gender in your response - only if you are comfortable doing so."
She cheated on me to date a man she met at the bar,"He’s just a friend”.

She’d say that on repeat like it would bring truth to the lie.

He was a regular at the pub she worked at. And it started small of course.

She’d stay out a little later with ‘him’. She’d go for drinks on a Friday with ‘him’. By the end she’d even sleep at ‘his’ house.

But always as a friend.

I am a hacking contractor, often contracted by various individuals for finding infidelity cases most times, And i have always be silently tempted to use my skills to find out if she was cheating. I have always said No.  

I pushed the issue once. Asked her if she felt it was appropriate to go home with a regular from the pub she worked at, and sleep at his house.

My question was deflected like a world-class boxer shrugging off a punch. Before a return blow was landed squarely on my concerns.

“You need to trust me” she’d say. “You don’t trust me to sleep on the couch at a friend’s house?”

So I let it go. And these small things began to grow into big things.

You can try and hold onto a relationship like that. But it’s water in your hands. Give it enough time, and you’ll be left with nothing, wondering who turned off the tap that had flooded you with happiness for years.

And so she was gone.

“I’m not leaving you to be with him” she said, the last night I saw her. “I just need to find myself in the world”.

Seemed incredible timing that they started dating a week later.

And you know what?

Despite the turmoil of seeing the ground approaching and having no way to exit the relationship gracefully...

Despite them celebrating their 6 month anniversary just 5 months after we broke up…

I get it. Because you don’t choose who you fall in love with. I could never hate someone for that. But you do choose how you handle it.

You can cheat - like she did. Or leave on your own - when you feel the waters running dry.

That’s where the most important unspoken boundaries come into play.

They’re not what you ask of someone else. But what you ask of yourself.

The greatest unspoken boundaries exists inside of you.

And it’s up to you to acknowledge them, not ignore them.

If you wake up and your attraction to your partner is gone, if you wake up and your respect for your partner is gone, if you wake up and your love for your partner is gone…

Then you need to pack your shit and go.

Once you fall out of love with someone, you leave.

Staying, and prolonging their pain by giving them hope, is a boundary you never cross.

Because when the waters of your relationship run dry, it’s not fair to make your partner think life-giving rain is on the way, when the earth is permanently scorched.

Oh and also don’t eat the last slice of pizza when I’m hungry.

That’s an unspoken boundary too."
"If your picture is more than one person, I'm going to assume you are the least attractive one.","I don't know why people do this. Honestly. I'm not trying to date your group of friends (well, I would but). I see so many people who just don't seem to get a dating profile pic. First of all, it should be YOU not you and three people, not a crowd shot. YOU. And it should be in focus. And lit. You should be, ya know, visible. And ANGLES! Don't be looking down at your phone all 32 chins or some weird shit. 

Sigh

Sorry.

I'm not a model or a photographer, but basics.

Light, focus, angle, face, you.

Effort.

Update: I'm getting replies that agree. But I also have replies that seem to think I'm too judgemental. I can only assume these are the people who can't be bothered to take a decent selfie for their profiles 😂"

Being single and in your 30's is financially amazing. Anyone else agree?,"I've never really thought about this until the virus. I have friends with kids, and they are just getting by. Barely floating above water. 

I am currently working, and it's incredible how much money I have been able to save up. After all of my bills, I am paying approximately $2200 CAD a month. Since everything is closed now, I'm spending around $1800. I have my own car and live alone in an apartment. 

Right now I'm just investing lots of my extra money into stocks.

Never stop those little acts of love and attention,"Just don't. 

They matter. You might not be aware of how much they do all of the time but they show how much you care in simple and little ways and make the other person feel appreciated.

May it be a simple good night text. A kiss or heart emoji others might think are childish. A cute nickname you only use when you two are alone. Holding hands like you're still teenagers...

Whatever you do... Keep doing it.

You don't know how much it may mean to the other person, even tough it might seem like nothing much to you. And it might just break their heart a little if you just suddenly stop.

Just wanted to put this out there."
"If someone says to you that they had a good time and want to see you again etc, PLEASE say it back to them if you feel the same way",I met up with a guy last week and it went really well and we’re still texting. I keep telling him that I want to see him again and that I miss him and can’t wait to hold him again and he just replies with stuff like “You will again soon” and “Awwww you’re so cute”. I just want to know that he feels the same way about me so I said to him “So you don’t miss me thennnnn” in a jokey way and he said that he thought it was just a given that he misses me too. No it’s not a given. Sometimes you just have to say things explicitly otherwise they will never know. Just wanted to give this small bit of advice to people.
Women who don't put an effort into having a conversation can't complain about dating,"I've matched with women who give me one word responses, or they put little effort into keeping the conversation going. 

My general rule of thumb is that I give these women A DAY before I stop talking to them. Does it decrease my options? Yeah. But self respect is way more important than keeping a conversation with a brick wall in the form of a person. 

Seriously. And the funniest thing about all of this is that these same women complain about men playing games with them! My initial reaction to someone not putting an effort into talking is that they're not interested, and I quickly move on. I believe most healthy-minded people would take the hint and keep it moving. 

Don't complain about what you attract if your behavior attracts certain types of people."
This sub has become a cesspool of forever alone rhetoric,"Way too many posts and comments in this sub are trending into forever alone territory by people who are dying for others to join their pity party and give them affirmation that dating (especially online dating) is pointless if you are an “average man”.

These people show up in practically every post and instantly try to shift the discussion toward them and how bad things are for men. Doesn’t matter if the post was written by a woman about a woman’s perspective on dating, these foreveralone types will always just marginalize their concerns and say “but what about men??” or “but men have it harder”.

* Dating is difficult for EVERYONE of both genders.

* Women don’t have it easy simply because there are a bunch of guys who want to have sex with them. In fact, those very guys are the reason WHY it’s difficult, because if you want a serious relationship you have to figure out who is serious and who is just pretending to be sincere to get in your pants

* Stanford University reported in a 2017 survey that online dating is the MOST POPULAR way for heterosexual couples to meet (39%). So the rhetoric that “average men” have no chance in online dating is a delusion that guys use justify their bitterness. 

Dating is not easy and has never been easy. If you take some time to listen to, understand, and emphasize with the perspective of other people (especially women) instead of just drowning them out with “what about men”, you will quickly realize that."
My WORST Date Ever!,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. You know the drill. Also, I'm on mobile. 

I thought I would share a funny dating experience with you all, maybe some people will get a laugh at my expense. Enjoy! Also, buckle in, cause' this isn't a short story. 

I (22f) went on a date with a guy (25m) a few months ago (pre-Covid). He seemed nice enough over text, and we had some similar interests, so I agreed to a date pretty quickly. I suggested a quick coffee date for a first time, but he was really insistent on ""taking me out for dinner, on him"". 

I'm a laid back gal, so I said, sure, let's go. We sit down at this Mongolian restaurant. Waitress comes by, and I order soup. As this is happening, he is talking OVER the waitress trying to take my order. At one point, the waitress literally stopped speaking to me, turned a full 90 degrees, and just stared at him with her lips together. I don't blame her. 

He laughed like it was a joke (?), THREW his menu up in the air for her to catch, and said he was ordering for me. She caught it, cause she's a great waitress, and simply turned back to me to take my order. Wanting this date to end already, I just order a bowl of soup (I hoped I could eat it quickly, pay, and get the heck away from this man). 

At this point he's ordered, although he said that his ex was ""the kind of bitch that can't take a joke."" I have no idea if that was a dig at me, his ex, or some combo of both... 

THEN, he starts going ON, and ON, and ONNNN about his ex. He called her every colourful name in the book. I don't mind swearing, but I do mind the use of the c-word in a crowded restaurant filled with children. I asked him to stop swearing so loudly, and he basically blew me off saying I was ""being ridiculous"". The angry eyes of the other diners didn't strike me as ridiculous, but okay. 

My soup finally arrives (let's be real, it had probably been 10 minutes, but every minute was agony). At this point, he hasn't done any of the following: 

A) introduced himself in person; he just sat down with no introduction
B) asked me anything about myself
C) Stopped his monologue about his ex long enough to breathe 

I use my food arrival as an opportunity to cut him off, and to change the subject. I ask him about our common interest - video games. I hoped maybe he would answer, then I could answer, but instead he stands up, and tells me we're going on a walk. 

I point at my soup, which is hot, but growing colder by the second. I ask if I can at least, finish part of my soup before it gets cold. He denies this request, and holds out his hand for me to grab (what a gentleman *eyeroll*). So, I call our extremely patient waitress over and ask to get it packed up. Keep in mind, his order is still somewhere in the kitchen, so I don't understand why he wants to leave without it. My BS-senses are tingling, so I tell him I have to use the washroom. 

Before he can say anything, I literally SPRINT to the ladies room. I call my best friend, and tell her to call me in 3 minutes with SOMETHING, ANYTHING, to get me out of this date. She's chucking a little, and I can't blame her. I'm a grown, adult woman standing in the toilets of a Mongolian restaurant begging my friend to get me out of a situation I put myself in. 

When I get back, his food has arrived and he has now, apparently, decided to stay (?). My soup is a bit chillier now, but tasty. He speaks super briefly about video games - but then goes right back to talking about his ex, what games they used to play, and, of course, what a bitch she is. 

I gently stop him and say, ""Hey, I'm uncomfortable with this line of conversation. I understand you dislike your ex, but surely you have other interests?"". He takes this as an opportunity to tell me about how his ex stalked him, and apparently stole something from him (?). 

At this point, the clouds part, and an angelic voice in the form of my ringtone sings out across the restaurant. It's my friend, telling me she... Oh no! She what? Broke her ankle falling down the stairs at her house? Oh god! I, of course, being the good friend I am, rush to help.  

I tell him I have to leave, it's an emergency. I stand up, but so does he. He says something about me trying to ""escape the best date he's ever had"". I chuckled, and tried to move around him, so I can get to the exit (and my car). 

He stops me with his arm on mine. I pull away, but I'm pretty small, so I'm not even sure he noticed my attempt. He tells me he NEEEDDSS a ride home, that he lives on the other side of town, and could I please drive him. At first I'm saying no, that I have to go, that it's an emergency. I even offered to give him a 20$ for a cab (anything to get away!). Then he points out we are in a bad part of town (he's right) and if I want his ""dead, lifeless body"" on my conscience. 

Ugh, fine. I agree to drive him home, against all better judgement. The drive is quiet, for once. I've resigned myself that I will not be able to get a word in edgewise, but he seems to realize he's being ditched. I don't really care, he isn't a very nice person. 

As I pull into his driveway, I put the car in park. I turn my head slightly to look at him, asking if he has everything (I do not want this man to have any excuse to contact me again). Keep in mind, my body language is screaming that I don't like him. I'm leaning away from him, despite facing him, and my face has morphed into a nasty scowl. 

This FUCKER had the absolute balls to try to kiss me! Read the room, buddy. I shove him back but he pushes against me anyway, kissing me on the lips. I bit him, hard, and told him to get the hell out of my car. He calls me a ""fucking tease"" but leaves. Thank god. 

I did make it home, and yes, my friend made a MIRACULOUS recovery. 

The story ain't over yet folks. 

About two weeks later, he's been texting me non-stop (I'm talking 3am, 4am, 5am texts). Finally, I simply text back that I'm not interested. Well. 

He first starts insulting me, THEN he apologizes (keep in mind, I'm getting about 30-40 texts all within 5 min during this convo). Then he starts trying to BARGAIN with me to sleep with him. He says things like ""I'll never bother you again, but I really want to f*ck you"". And ""Please, just have sex with me. Please?"" 

I tell him to, frankly, get bent. I now realize that he's a ""NiCE gUy"" to the extreme.  I blocked his number. 

Well, that's my worst date ever! One for my history books, at least. So, pro-tip to any would-be daters out there - maybe don't talk about your ex the entire time?"
If you’re going to make the choice to date right now then prepare.,"Prepare for delays in communication. 

Prepare for a lack of consistency. 

Prepare for emotional unavailability. 

Prepare for waning interest. 

Prepare for general disappointment because there’s just so much going on in so many different peoples lives right now that, fucking honestly and goddamn, it’s just not a good time to date right now."
The bar is at the fooking FLOOR,"I'm a below average/average dude, but I'm always shocked at how basic manners are seen as acts of kindness whenever I go on a date. 

I recently went on a date with a girl, and I told her she looked really good. She instantly lit up and said that she's NEVER had someone tell her that before on a date. I'm like wtf. Man that's a bit sad because I felt like she was a good-looking person and I thought it was a polite thing to say. 

On another occasion, I was watching Big Mouth with a date and there was a scene where this dude tries to push a girl's head towards his crouch, indicating that he wanted oral sex. She told me about how that's happened to her a few times on a date, and again, I'm like wtf; that's rude af. 

I don't know man. My ex girlfriend a couple of years told me that I was the only person who treated her right, but nothing about me is special--nor romantic.

Ultimately, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the bar is at the fooking FLOOR."
"Anyone else find it insulting that lack of dating/sexual experience is seen as a ""red flag"" ?","What exactly makes dating or sexual inexperience a ""red flag""? It says nothing about what kind of person you are and what kind of partner you would make. Calling inexperience a ""red flag"" just sounds like another way to say ""if you don't abide by society's standards of what your dating life should look like then you're unattractive/weird/abnormal."" I just dont get it lol. 

-a 23 year old female virgin

Edit: Just to clarify this post for all the experienced people commenting. My post isn't about experienced people not wanting to date inexperienced people. It's about the stigma that comes with being inexperienced (ie. a ""red flag"")."
This is what I've learned from my previous relationship,"Everyone says that every relationship that you have, either a good or a bad one, teaches you a lesson. However, it is easier said than done. We often think about how much we suffered, or how we wish we would've done things differently. Tonight, I stopped for a second, distanced myself from all the pain that I've been feeling, and made a list about everything that my previous 3 year old relationship has taught me. I hope you like, and feel free to share your thoughts! Here it is:

1. Love does not overcome everything. It takes a lot more than just loving someone, in order to make a relationship work.

2. You can love someone to death and still not wanting that person to be in your life ever again.

3. Respect is actually more important than trust. Let me explain. You can lie to someone and gain their trust again, even though it is hard (and it definitely depends on how much you ruined someone else's trust), but once you lose respect about someone else, it's almost impossible to respect them again. I mean, you can try, but in the long run, it will be a problem again.

4. Don't overlook the red flags. This happens mostly in the beginning of every relationship, you're so drunk in love with your partner that you try to brush off every red flag that you come across. Don't do it. It will only get worse over time.

5. If you're in a relationship, both of you will make time for each other, and neither of you will have to ask for it. Once you do, and you feel bad for asking your partner to do so, something's wrong.

6. Always be aware of the way that person treats their parents (especially their mom). They won't treat you any better than that. (obviously, I'm not referring to toxic family dynamics, that's a whole different thing). 

7. Both of you can change throughout the relationship, and grow together as one. But, don't expect someone to change really rooted patterns. It will only hurt you, and your partner.

8. If you breakup with your SO, and he/she says ""I'll change for you"", don't give him/her another chance. Not only they won't change, but they should want to change for THEMSELVES, regardless of the outcome of your relationship.

9. Communication is the key to everything. If you're willing to talk things out and your partner is always trying to brush it off with a silly apology, your problems will only grow until they become unbearable.

10. Love yourself more than anyone else. If you don't, you'll become submissive and you'll lose your identity throughout the course of your relationship. You'll become more and more dependent on your partner, and it'll be a hundred times harder to say ""enough is enough"".

11. I believe in second chances. But you shouldn't give more than that. Once you do, they think you'll never leave and it'll only get worse.

12. Besides cheating, there are wounds that can never be healed. When you find yourself thinking about getting back with your ex, think about everything that has been said or done, and if you could look at that person differently. 
If not, then don't go back. You may miss that person, you may still love him/her, but sometimes, there's just too much damage."
Dating in 2020 is like being handed a math equation that no one has ever solved and the only people who have solved it don't know how they did.,"Anyone else feel like dating in 2020 is impossible. I have been online dating since 2010 and it just continues to get worse. What's more is that people seem pickier by the minute and their lists get longer. I'm seriously starting to lose hope that I'll ever meet anyone.

Side note, why are men so threatened by intelligent women? (Stream of consciousness statement deleted)

Edit: okay clearly this side note is getting all the attention. I'll have to more carefully word my posts so as not to offend anyone. Despite the impressions given by the side note, I am not an egotistical maniac. I am by far from the best at anything and I don't think I'm better than others.

Knowing you're someone's first priority is such a rush,"My boyfriend just quit his old job as it was very bad for him emotionally, so he took the first good job he could find. It's a good job but the only downfall is that he's going to be away a LOT. He'll basically only be back on weekends.

 He starts on Monday, but he just made it very clear that if I don't like it or if I feel it's affecting our relationship to tell him and he will quit immediately.

He said the last thing be wants to do is fuck up what we have, and just his willingness really hit different. Sorry, just wanted to gush

Edited to add:
I see the points people are making, and I should have been more clear. First I guess I shouldn't have said ""immediately"", because he said he's going to try it out for at least a month, and I wouldn't even try to ask him to quit without trying it out for a good while first.

Also, this was never going to be a career for him anyway. It's doing roofing just for the summer with a friend of his. Just until he figures out what he would like to do more permanently. It was the quickest job he could start to get out of his other one.

One commenter put it pretty well I think, that my boyfriend and I prioritize more time together than some people. It's not for everyone but I'm glad it works for both of us. And obviously not everyone even has that opportunity, like the nurse in the comments who hasn't been able to see her boyfriend since covid started, due to him having an immunocompromised son. Major respect from me, that sounds really tough."
"Hoping things will go well, dating while fat.","I'm about to (in 5ish minutes) go on a date.  I'm a very heavy (250 lbs at average heigh) woman, and I'm sooooo nervous to put myself out there like this.  I have told the guy I'm seeing that I am heavy and he has seen photos of me, but I am definitely sucking it in, because of course.  

I am wearing my hair down, put on makeup, gonna wear jewelry and painted my toenails, basically trying to look my best, and I'm really hopeful things will go well.  I'm 39, never been married and just really hoping to meet a nice guy.  Fingers crossed!

UPDATE:  Thanks for all your kind and loving comments.  I am home from my date now and he and I have exchanged texts indicating interest in a 2nd date so I think it went well.  We walked around our local rose garden, which was romantic and we had a little talk, I kept it brief.  It was nice :D"
Stop ghosting people and have OPEN COMMUNICATION,"Let’s stop ghosting people and try normalizing better and open communication!

1. If you lose interest in someone, tell them.
2. If you’re not looking for a relationship and you know the other person is, tell the person you’re seeing.
3. If you’ve gone on a date with someone and you didn’t feel the connection, tell them.
4. If you’ve gone on several dates with someone and don’t see a future with them, tell the person you’re seeing!
5. If you changed your mind on going on a date, tell them AS SOON AS YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND. 
6. If you’re not good at texting/ DMs, tell the person you’re talking to. They’re going to think you don’t like them. 
7. If you have a different communication style, tell the person you’re talking to. 
8. If you’re seeing several people at the same time and the other person has told you they want to be exclusive, tell them if you don’t want to be exclusive. Don’t string them along. 
9. If you’re looking for hookups, make that clear to the person you’re talking to. 

Some conversations may be difficult to hve but it’s better to be open and honest than to ghost someone or string them along. Please respect everyone you’re talking and interacting with instead of leading them on. It would be much appreciated!"
From experience: Mixed Signals are almost always no intention of actually pursuing a relationship/date. Mixed signals are usually “I like the attention you are giving me” and that’s it.,"I am 35 (male) and I wish I had learnt this years ago. Really “learn it” not just know it. 

In my experience about 99% of the times someone throws you constant curve balls that just means they are playing with you. They are not being mean, their brains deceive them into thinking you know what they are doing. 

Learn this: Even when someone texts you randomly at night, or they go out with you but remain at arms distance, or say nice things about how good they feel around you, BUT won’t become romantic, they are just using your attention.

Become romantic means actively seeking or agreeing to be alone with you at night. Feeling confortable with being alone with you. Seeking or allowing touching and lingering of such touch. Obviously kissing and holding hands. 

Romantic doesn’t mean telling you their secrets. Constant texting. Non flirtatious compliments like “you are sweet” or “you make me happy”. Asking you out on things they want to do but no one would do with them...

Curve balls also include texting you but then leave you hanging when you ask for a date and then changing the subject. Telling you about how awesome you are but then dating someone else. Going out with you, **constantly allowing you to pay** but then telling you they have an early morning and then you seeing in their social media they continued the night somewhere else.

Attraction is almost instant in most cases, if someone wants to feel you and touch you they will soon enough. Don’t waste a lot if time waiting for it to happen. If someone is throwing you curve balls just move on.

Good luck."
One of the most attractive things in a man...,"...is the ability to run his own household. Honestly, I‘ve dated all types of men.

There was the one guy who was very sweet and kind but came from a Greek island so had been raised by the stereotypical Greek mum. One of his uncles had lived with my date‘s grandmother until the day this uncle married his wife. And his wife was only deemed acceptable after her cooking had been tasted. This uncle never had to cook his own meals in his life. My date had been culinarily spoilt by his loving mum as well which led to him somehow thinking that it was sufficient for himself to put onions, Frankfurter sausages and ketchup in a sauce pan to make pasta sauce.

Then there was the guy who was great at cooking but never ever bothered with tidying up. It was so stressful. I am not the tidiest of people but every 10 days to two weeks I‘ll give my flat a proper tidy and clean up. I clean my bathroom weekly and my wee vacuum robot vacuums every other day. But this guy‘s flat and house were just...they looked like he‘d just moved in, several years after he had. 

Then there were the guys who could neither cook nor clean, one’d keep plastic cups full of put-out cigarettes around for ages before throwing them out and always order in or eat out. One‘d have months worth of fizzy pop plastic bottles piling up (in Germany we get cash for them, so returning them to the supermarket is actually great!). 

And finally, I dated one guy who was actually able to look after himself. He meal-prepped every Sunday: veggies usually with chicken breast or other healthy meats, or pasta or more or less anything. He‘d cook all his own food, clean and tidy his place to a decent normal level, wash and iron his work clothes...sadly I‘m not dating him anymore but honestly, his ability to run his own household smoothly was just so attractive. Maybe I’m just judgmental but it just gave me an impression of self-sufficiency and autonomy and I KNEW that dating him would mean I‘d have an easier time sharing the household chores equally. Rather than me doing most of the chores as women in straight relationships are likely to do. Him running his own household in a healthy manner was just a very mature and manly behaviour that made me very happy. Maybe I‘m weird.

Edit: Okay, this has blown up. Some people ask me why did I break up with the last guy, or why did he break up with me. You can read this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswlyy9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Other people have asked me about where I dated these men and where they were from. One guy was Greek, one was Cypriot Greek, one was half-English/Asian (will not disclose nation), one was Australian (the tidy guy at the end) and one was German. I dated the German in Germany and all the other ones in the UK. I actually forgot another guy, half-English/half-French, who also ran his own household perfectly well.

Edit 2: Here‘s a speculation on why that guy stopped loving me, [click](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/gwlctn/one_of_the_most_attractive_things_in_a_man/fswqeya/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
My first date in years was a disaster,"I recently took a break from working 80-90 hrs a week and just focused more on my health and life. I met this girl on Hinge, and while I wasn't super attracted to her, I also haven't gone on a date in many years. Thus, I said ""what the hell"" and went on a date with her. That was a big mistake. 

From the moment we sat down, she starts talking politics. Oh no. She tells me she's a major Trumper supporter, which isn't an absolute deal breaker, but when I asked her why she supported him, she said ""I like what he's doing with the minorities."" Now, mind you, I'm ASIAN, so I'm just cringing super hard and chuckling awkwardly to prevent a full on verbal assault. 

Then she starts talking to me about the penises that she's seen. She tells me that Asian guys have pretty small penises and that she hopes my ""pecker"" isn't too small. Now, I don't think I'm a small guy, but it definitely made me feel very insecure and a bit curious as to what the hell is wrong with her. I quickly changed the topic to pets to avoid another awkward conversation. 

Finally, as we're leaving the restaurant, she tells me about how guys who participate in gangbangs/threesomes are all gay because they like the sight of other men's cocks. This was not a topic that I was well versed in, so I made another effort to change the conversation. She then tells me out of nowhere that she doesn't like gay guys, and that's why she'll never participate in a threesome with two guys. At that point, I just wanted to get away from her, so I nodded and smiled at everything she said.

As we're getting in our separate cars to leave, she starts smoking a cigarette and then kisses me on the mouth. It wasn't great. She notices my grimace and laughs and says ""my daughter doesn't like me kissing her either when I'm smoking"". This was a real shocker considering we are both somewhat young, and her profile had no sign of any kids. I quickly said goodbye to her and drove home to take a stiff drink. Now I see why people say dating can be so exhausting. Weeding through the list of incompatible people is herculean, and the ones who find their soulmates quickly are truly blessed.

Edit: some context on why she acted that way: to be fair, she was going through a lot in life. She just broke up with her boyfriend of many years who refused to pay rent on the house they leased together. They broke up because he wanted to join a swingers club and she did not. Anyways, she had a plethora of money problems, and she had a lot of “first date anxiety” which I suppose could explain all the weird conversation topics."
I don’t understand seeing multiple people at once,(22M) Recently broke it off with a girl because of this. I don’t see the benefit in flirting or dating multiple people at once. When I date I just tend to focus on one person at a time. If the person doesn’t work out I move on until I find the next and so on. To the point where even thinking of flirting with another person seems wrong until I officially stop talking to them. The more that I’m reading about this though it seems to be the norm to be talking to multiple people at once until they become ‘exclusive’ to one. It’s bonkers to me and I honestly don’t get it.
Unpopular opinion: It's possible to catch feelings for absolutely anyone. Either you control your feelings or your feelings will control you.,"I believe that you can fall in love with anyone who is somewhat attractive. I think the more time you spend connecting with a good looking person, more feelings are created. I believe we have the power to control who we're into. I don't think soul mates exist.

EDIT: This post blew up more than I anticipated... Thanks for all your answers.

EDIT 2: When I say attractive I'm not just talking about physical attraction, I'm talking about all the characteristics that make the person attractive. I know you need more than physical attraction to fall in love. That's super superficial lol. All you need is attraction"
An Upside of Wearing a Mask,One upside of wearing a mask is that you can hide the fact that your crying as you’re walking down the sidewalk. Sunglasses and a hat complete the look.
If you ghost after sex you’re the worst kind of person,"So I got ghosted this week and I’m honestly a little in shock. Just wanted to vent. We went out 6 times and had a couple sleepovers. The last couple times I saw him we had sex. He kept saying he wanted to see me again, I was really sweet and fun, blah blah. Now he’s vanished. I’m not going to text him again (already sent 3 unanswered texts in the last week and a half)  because I respect myself enough to know that he’s never going to answer and he’s not worth it. 

Just wanted to vent here. 

Seriously, if you’ve been intimate with someone, you can be honest and just let them down easy. Just say you’re not interested. That’s it. Just so they don’t have to wait by their phone and second guess and worry. 

I’ve been reading a lot of posts here from people who’ve been ghosted and it helped a bit. Just wanted to share my feelings here because I have nowhere else to let them out really. 

At the end of the day, I’m glad I put myself out there. I’ve been single for most of my adult life but I’d like to be braver and try to find someone to share life with. So at least I tried."
I’m surprised at how normal it seems to be to expect sex relatively fast,"The other day I read a comment from a guy saying that if a girl hasn’t had sex with him by date 5, he assumes that she’s either not interested in him or not interested in sex in general and moves on. This seemed like quite a leap to me, but I marked it as an outlier and moved on. 

Today, there was a whole thread about it where many people agreed that it was a huge problem to not have sex/sexual contact by the 5th date. Is this view really that common? 

I’m someone who usually likes there to be a good emotional connection/building of trust first, and to me it seems a little wild that this is supposed to happen by the 5th date. If the dates started with the person as a total stranger,  I feel like you’re still just at the tip of the iceberg with getting to know them by 5 dates. 

I don’t know, I was just shocked by this consensus, and it seems like a wild leap to say that someone’s either asexual or not interested if there’s not sex by 5 dates. I will also say that as a woman, many guys will see you as “easy” for putting out too soon in their eyes, so it seems like a damned if you do, damned if you don’t kind of situation.

Edit: after reading the replies it seems like as a woman, it can be easy to feel like a guy’s just in it for the sex/not in it very seriously if he pushes for it too much/too fast, but as a guy, it can be easy to feel like the girl is not interested/not in it very seriously if the girl’s not having sex after a bit. What a mess"
Shout out to the guy who concocted an entire list of reasons why he couldn't be in a serious relationship...and then was in a serious relationship 2 weeks after we ended,"Shout out to you sir. We see you. You were very convincing. Every reason you gave, from ""I'll be moving soon and can't be tied down"" to ""I have way too much going on in my life/too many balls in the air to devote time to seriously dating"" to ""my previous relationship really did a number on me and I'm more cautious now"" to ""I just want to make sure we're a solid match first"" to whatever else you came up with that I can't even remember...the performance alone was Oscar worthy. You must have really done some soul searching in those two weeks between our ""breakup"" and you going Facebook official with a new girl. Some serious inner work as well as all your supposed previous roadblocks suddenly being non-existent. Well played.

Remember kids, it's never ""I'm not looking for a serious relationship"". It's only ""I'm not looking for a serious relationship with you"". This sub is right."
I won’t change myself for a man anymore,"I had a date the other night that really made me think. 
The date itself was fine, at first. I (a 29F) had someone I’ve been chatting with and gone out with twice before (a 30M) over for dinner. I worked hard all day to make things nice before he got there. I put on my favorite new dress, deep cleaned the house, strung up lights in the three seasons room since that’s where we’d be eating, lit my favorite candles from Anthropologie, etc. it was nice! When he got there he said I looked great and so did the house and the food smelled good. Things were off to a decent start. 
Then as we talked more while the food was cooking I started to realize we are VERY different people. Like to the point where we just might not be compatible. 
The difference? Well he talked a lot about wanting to live in a van on a farm and keeping bees and trying to live “zero waste”. That’s all well and good but I almost felt like he was shaming me for not being so extreme with being environmentally conscious. I am conscious of it...I am vegan for ethical and environmental reasons. However, I have my limits. Like I’m not going to live in a van. I worked really hard to get where I am today. I’ve been able to afford myself and above average life. I don’t live extravagantly but I do enjoy quality things. 

For the majority of the date I tried to be open minded and see things from his perspective. After all, I am always trying to better myself and if he can teach me something, I’m all ears. However, as the night wore on things got more personal. He talked about farming...which I know a lot about since I’m a farmers daughter. I grew up on one of the largest produce farms on the east coast and I know what it takes to farm large scale. He seemed to dismiss that and continued to tell me why non-organic farming is essentially the devils work. I came back with some valid arguments to the contrary but realized he was not amenable to entertaining a thought that didn’t align with his opinion so I just started nodding in agreement with him to end the conversation. Then he asked me my stance on monogamy- I said that‘s my goal. He said he’d be “open to monogamy” if that was something I wanted (aka implying that’s not his normal and he’s used to dating multiple ppl at a time). It made me uncomfortable. I know that is ok with a lot of folks but it’s not for me. I told him that. Then he said that was OK and that this is “something new for both of us.” I asked what he meant and he said he’s not used to dating someone so “status quo.” What the hell, right?! I asked him to elaborate and he said “look around. You own this home. You’re successful and definitely not my usual type. It’s intimidating.” I think he meant to flatter me but it felt like sandpaper. To me all I heard was “you’re basic and your life is not alternative enough for me and I’d be doing you a favor by dating you exclusively.” Maybe that’s not how he meant it but that’s what I heard. 
In that moment I knew I could either try and alter myself to threaten his ego less or I could walk away from it. I chose the latter. Also side note- he wanted to hook up but I said no and he suggested a tantric breathing exercise together instead. I’m sorry but WHAT?! I knew in that moment that choosing the latter was the best option for me. 

Ever since the date I’ve been thinking about WHY I’m still dating (although I did just get out of a long term partnership with someone more compatible so it’s not like I’m undatable). I realized I’m just not willing to coddle a man’s ego who I barely even know anymore. I can’t date the men who are so strong in their convictions that they end up personally attacking me for not conforming to their niche way of living. I can’t then change who I am to make THEM feel more comfortable. I can’t have debates with a man who goes into these conversations thinking I’m not going to speak intelligently about a conflicting opinion or who flat out unwilling to hear a conflicting opinion.  

Maybe my dating pool may shrink as my likeminded peers are settling down but maybe that’s not a bad thing."
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Stop making tinder dates with people who are looking for a relationship if you “aren’t in a good place and not ready to date”.,"This is happened to me 3 or 4 times in the last couple months and I’m starting to get sick of it. If I tell you I’m looking for a relationship, don’t try to make plans and then cancel last minute because you “don’t want to date right now.”

EDIT: since this keeps coming up and I can’t change the title, I’m not specifically only talking about tinder dates. I mean online dating in general. In my area, tinder just so happens to be the most common way to meet new people online. But I also use bumble and a couple other platforms."
Become the person you want to date,"I realised today that you have to become the person you want to date which usually means you have to upgrade yourself.

You can't date a person of a high standard if you aren't of a high standard yourself.

You can't date an intelligent person if you're not intelligent yourself.

You can't date a smart and fashionable person if you're not smart and fashionable yourself.

You can't date a fit person if you're not fit yourself. 

I stepped back and asked myself whether I would date myself and I straight up said no because I am not stylish, super fun, adventurous or really intelligent; all the qualities I want in a partner. And sadly, I am not attracting that calibre of a partner right now.

However, I have committed myself to improving my style by dressing well and mixing with people of the same calibre in their environments.

I have committed to developing my knowledge and skills though learning languages - currently learning Spanish and have a teacher, structure and infrastructure in place to succeed.

I have committed to exploring the world and having stories to tell about the wonderful people I have met and connected with along my journey.

And none of what I have said is easy but it's definitely worth it in the end."
I started dating a guy who has his shit together,"I feel like every guy i meet either don't have a job, or are lazy as hell, messy, doesn't know how to do basic things like dishes or laundry. 

But I just started seeing a guy who lives on his own, has his own car, has a good job, keeps a clean place and knows how to adult. 

He might be a robot. 

I will update.

Update: Hes 5'7. All of you stop crying about height.

Update 2: It has now been 1 month since we started seeing each other. He has introduced me to so many things i have never done before (like ice fishing, riding a motorcycle, archery) He is always so fun and active but he also give me my own life.  If i am out with friends, he doesn't blow up my phone checking in the whole night. He just lets me live my life and is happy I'm having a good time. So far he is quite amazing, full 360 from my last relationships. He's so attentive to my needs and we have a rediculous amount in common but are so different at the same time. This could actually become something amazing."
Smart girls are more attractive than dumb girls.,"In my personal opinion a smart girl who's a 7 is better than a dumb girl who's a 9. Being intelligent makes a person more attractive. As well as having a good personality. Bland girls who are ""hot"" aren't interesting and therefore less attractive. Does anyone else agree with this statement?

Edit: I didn't necessarily mean a 7 vs a 9 or whatever I just meant someone who by normal standards would be considered ""less attractive"". Also i would be willing to stake my life on the idea that most women are easily 7s. And most women if they have a good personality break the fucking scale. There's no way to actually rate people because everyone sees people differently. The 1-10 scale is for me at least just a blanket basis. Most guys and I'm sure women rate people on this scale before they've met them. After you've met someone the scale no longer exists because it's no longer just a blanket opinion. It can be expanded upon. (I probably just dug myself a deeper hole but too late now)"
Can we stop normalizing ghosting as a part of modern dating and recognize that it’s a completely unacceptable thing to do to someone?,"You see so many posts/articles  talking about how it’s common in modern dating, focusing on the victims and talking about how much it hurt... but where are the folks who are ANGRY?? You know, the way we are when someone cheats? We get PISSED!! 

It’s not that different from cheating. It leaves you wondering why you weren’t good enough for that person. You feel used, disrespected, insulted and indignant. And IT’S NOT OKAY. 

JUST GROW THE FUCK UP AND SAY HOW YOU FEEL, PEOPLE. IT’S NOT THAT HARD!!!!

And if you’ve been ghosted.. don’t let them get away with it and don’t feel like it’s your fault in some way... GET PISSED!!

EDIT: 

Taking this from one of my comments to clear this up: It’s upsetting that people are misunderstanding what I was trying to say but this is it. Im not trying to control other people like some commenters are saying because here’s the thing: if this guy were to message me and tell me that this wasn’t working for him anymore for one reason or another, I would understand! And I would say so! And sure not everyone would react to that rejection maturely, but like (one commenter) said you can’t control that. You can only do your best to be honest, mature, and respectful yourself. Not everyone is going to do the same, and if they don’t... good riddance. You did your part and you don’t have to have them in your life anymore. But the reality is that most people are going to understand. Most people have experienced rejection before and can handle it, but honesty and communication makes that a lot easier to process.

The person who ghosted me invited me to his cousin’s wedding and said he wanted a relationship in the future. We slept together multiple times, spent multiple full days together and had a ton of fun, and we talked about how surprised we were by how much we ended up liking each other. Then he disappeared. So no, I’m not talking about some Tinder date you never met that stopped messaging you. 

And yes, cheating is a different level of betrayal. I have been cheated on and I know how traumatizing it can be. I’m sorry if that comparison offended some people but what I meant was that being ghosted is degrading in a similar way.

EDIT 2: Also weird that everyone assumes I’m talking about online dating tbh. I was ghosted by someone I was in a relationship with for 6 months, someone who I knew from junior high in my hometown aka real life. Currently being ghosted by a guy I met in college.

EDIT 3: Also I’m a woman. Not an incel or whatever as people seem to assume. Sooooo there’s that."
A couple things I’ve learned after years of online dating/ dating in general…,"\-Straight up ask guys what they are looking for. Make sure that you guys are on the same page. If he wants something causal and you are looking for a LTR, DO NOT TRY TO MAKE HIM CHANGE HIS MIND. You deserve someone who is looking for the same think as you

\-If a guy is not putting effort in the conversation chances are he is not that interested in you

\-People will come up with lame excuses to hide their bad behavior....""I don't believe in labels."" During the first months of dating take these as a potential red flag

\-During the first months of dating never take his words too seriously. ""I see a future together..."" Wait until the honeymoon phase has faded away to understand his true intentions.

\-When you go on a first date, have zero expectations, even if you matched with the CEO of this Tech company. Some people are very different in person or hide their true personality over a ""nice guy"" facade. Tell yourself that you are just gonna enjoy the evening with some cool company.

\-Ask deep questions that go beyond superficial stuff as hobbies and music

\-Actions speak louder than words

\-Discuss stuff over FaceTime or in-person. Avoid disagreement over text. Some people are amazing writers that make you believe that they are willing to change.

\-The moment you feel that he is not putting effort into the relationship, confront him. If he doesn’t change… END IT. You deserve something better

\-Being someone’s gf is more than a title. Ask yourself, does he actually treats me like a SO?

\-Don’t come up with weird theories of why he is acting weird. ""Maybe he hasn’t called me cause he is stressed."" If someone is truly interested in you, they’ll take the time (This is true 90% of the time)…believe me

\-Never change your boundaries for a SO, if you are not ok with kissing on the first day don’t do it. Players seem to smell when people are willing to break their boundaries for love and they’ll often take advantage of you.

\-Successful career doesn’t indicate emotional maturity 

\-If you are looking for something meaningful don’t sleep with them right away. See if they are willing to get to known you 

\-Watch out for guys who often compare with their ex most of the times this indicates that they haven’t gotten over her

\- Don’t express your insecurities early on 
Is he ten times hotter than you? Is he your first bf? Do you feel that you are not attractive? 
If he asked you out on a date is because he finds you attractive. Players can smell insecurities, you are way more than just a pretty face :)

\- Ask yourself am I in love with the guy or am in love with the idea of being in love? 

\- Have a clear idea what you want but don’t got out of your way to accomplish it. Let’s say that you want a relationship, try to meet people and see if thing workout but don’t try to force it 

\- During the first months of dating take things slow. Don’t go out of your way to make him happy. 

This also applies to girls…..

Edit: I decided to put this bullet point together after reading so many post of people being played

Edit 2: Added the last three points"
"You guys know that Swiping Right 100% of the time gets your Tinder profile shadowbanned, right?","I thought this was common knowledge, but everyday I see guys complain that they swipe right on every girl and get no matches.

Its because that makes the algorithm assume you are a bot, and hides your profile from everyone else.  You can log in and swipe like normal but nothing will happen.  Even just swiping too often lowers your visibility.

Just be more selective.  Theres no way you would actually want to meet up with 100% of the people on the app anyway.  Have some self respect, bros and sisses"
"I don’t know what men need to hear this, but Cockiness is acting like you own the place. Confidence is just acting like you’ve been there before.","I always see a lot of confusion around what the difference between cocky and confident is and this analogy is the best thing I can think of to really demonstrate it. 

If you’re at a club/bar and want to buy rounds for everyone as a flex, do it without announcing it. Act as though it’s something you just do. If you drive a nice car, don’t rev it up in the parking lot, and don’t even mention it until she asks about it, even after she sees it. 

If you bench a lot or dominate a sport, bring up only that you do it, then let her find out on her own from Instagram/whatever how impressive you are. 

You need to be jaded by your own special attributes because you’re always looking forward and on to becoming better, not constantly reflecting on yourself as if you’ve peaked."
"I want to be ok on my own, but it feels impossible when I long for romance and love","This feeling comes in waves. Some days, I’m happy with being single and enjoy the time to myself but on days like today, I feel completely miserable knowing that I am worthy of love but can’t have it. All I have ever wanted ever since I was a little girl was to love someone and be loved in return. I’ve always been a hopeless romantic and was an amazing girlfriend to my ex but he wasnt to me; not even close. I’m just so depressed with how awful most of the guys I’ve been with are. I’m torn between believing dating is hopeless, yet I remain hopeful that I’ll meet the right person and keep this idealized vision of the man I want in my head and tell myself that he exists. All I think about lately is this man of my dreams whom I’ve never met. It just hurts to not have that right now when I know I am more than enough.

Other days, I just want nothing to do with men and constantly lurk on this sub for hours at a time. It’s like I’m trying to convince myself that I don’t want a man, when truthfully, I do. Either the guy I want is super attractive and a jerk, semi-attractive but a player, or average with mental illnesses (my ex-anger issues and violent tendencies). Probably dramatic, but these have been my personal experiences. Maybe part of it too is that I was with a toxic person for so many years and I just want someone who’s actually good for me.

How the hell can you be ok on your own when you’re a hopeless romantic who feels like they deserve a good guy?

**Update: Wow, you guys... I am in straight awe by the outpour of your responses and just want to thank all of you for taking the time to give me your support and sharing your stories. I have read every single post and am blown away. You've given me faith that hope is not lost and it can happen. There IS someone out there for me, and there's someone out there for you too. Like someone else said, the good ones get snatched up in the dating pool while the bad ones stay, and the dating scenes I approach like dating apps and bars do not attract the right men.** 

**Sometimes my mind spirals and I feel very caught up in the fantasy of love that I crave with someone. I had no idea anyone else out there felt this way too and honestly thought I was an outlier in my generation because no one my age talks about this. To the people who think I am needy for desiring a man, I actually do enjoy being single and feel liberated by how much it has allowed me to accomplish-I know I don't need a man but I do want love. I prefer being single over my previous relationship by a landslide. Thank you for ensuring me that this feeling is human and that there is hope out there. I really needed this today. <3**"
[VENT] Men keep using the pandemic as an excuse to skip right to “come over”,"Ok guys buckle up because I am PISSED. I would say that more than half the guys I have talked to on Hinge/Bumble think they can use the pandemic to skip going out and get me to just come over. It’s frustrating because almost everything in my city has opened back up again. 

“I’m fixing myself a drink, care to join? Not safe in public.”

“I would normally take you out but I’m not going out in public right now. Come over?” 

If you “don’t want to go out in public” then why invite a complete stranger into your home? HOW ABOUT NO. We can find something distanced or outdoors to do so I can at least be afforded the opportunity to meet you in person. And if you are actually concerned about being in public then you should be prepared to wait it out AND THEN try to date. 

The killer is that they actually get pissed when I decline or propose doing something outdoors first instead. Are you kidding me? Are most women in the habit of showing up at total strangers houses? 

God!"
“I’m not looking for a relationship”,"Something I need to remind myself is to LISTEN TO SOMEONE WHEN THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP!!
 
What I learned is, if someone says this to you, I need to take it at face value. There is one of two reasons why someone would say that. The first reason is that they are only looking for something physical and they know that if you have repeat “hang outs,” the other party has a higher chance of catching feelings. They want to prevent that conversation in the future about defining the relationship and they don’t want to be the bad guy. They can say “I told you from the start I didn’t want a relationship.”
 
The second reason why someone would say this is because they are not interested in a relationship with you. What this means is, they don’t see you as a match. They would be interested in a relationship but you don’t have the qualities they want. Don’t take it to heart because that just means this wasn’t the right pairing. However, do leave the situation if you are, in fact, looking for a relationship.
 
Even though I know this, it can be hard to remember this!!!"
A girl asked me out! So surprised!,"I was really surprised, because I've heard that girls very very rarely make the first move. She asked me if I'd like to hang out with her after quarantine gets over. 

She also explicitly mentioned that she really likes me :)

Fingers crossed people! Waiting for quarantine to get over ASAP"
"If I don't need a relationship to be happy, why does being single hurt so much?","Every time I think about being single and my frustrations with dating my mind crosses the advice that everyone gives, talking about how I should be happy with myself first and that I shouldn't be looking for a relationship for the sake of having one.

But there's this constant sensation of emptiness and sadness every time these thoughts come up and I just wish I still had someone to call a partner and I constantly wonder if I'm in the wrong or if I truly need some form of companionship. It feels like these two narratives in my head are constantly fighting and it leaves me feeling drained and incredibly depressed."
My cat is sexually frustrated and I can really sympathise.,"I (28F) haven't been very successful with dating recently and apart from being frustrated about not being in a relationship, the lack of sex is driving me nuts. I have a high sex drive, and while I haven't been in a proper relationship for 5 years I somehow managed to have longer dating phases or FWBs, so at least I got some quite regularly. Now my last 9 months thing fizzled out in December, and since then it's been dry. I hardly get to know new interesting people where I am, and I suck at OLD. So I had ONE date this year, resulting in nothing as the guy started seeing someone else (no hard feelings).
A few weeks ago I adopted a cat. I got one from a family who couldn't afford keeping her, she hasn't been chipped or fixed. And now that poor thing went into heat and is crying for sex. She is crawling through the flat holding her butt up hoping some male cat comes along and notices her. She's longing for affection and making such desperate noises. This is exactly how I feel inside. 
Lucky her, she's getting spayed next week and won't care anymore. I will have to continue this lonely life.

Edit: this is just a (slightly amusing I think) vent, I don't need advice on dating. I only have sex with guys I have a connection with and am attracted to.

Edit2: just adding, I am not looking for a FWB, and this is just a post having a laugh about me and my cat both missing out on sex."
The biggest problem with so many relationships today is that people can’t handle arguments or disagreement.,"Say you and your partner have an argument about something. A lot of times, people never get past it and say it’s not working out. 

And then they go swipe swipe swipe on the merry go round of dating apps."
I asked a girl out today,"I asked a girl out today. It was just a random girl I saw on the street. I was bringing some groceries home and I saw her standing next to me at the crosswalk. I kept glancing at her, and when our paths diverged, I noticed she and her friend went over and sat on a bench in the park.

As I was walking home, I couldn't stop thinking of her. She was stunning, and I wanted to ask her out. I felt terrible that I hadn't though, thinking I had missed my chance. I usually resign myself to online dating for fear of bothering random people in person who probably are not interested or available. 

I got home, put down my groceries, and decided I had to man up and do it.  As I started running back to the park, I felt a sinking in my stomach, I became a little light headed and my heart was nearly racing. I was terrified of the rejection I thought may be coming, but I kept going.

As I made my way into the park, I saw her still sitting there, I was lucky they hadn't left yet. I approached, told her that after seeing her I couldn't get her out of my head, and that I couldn't live with myself if I didn't come back to ask her out. She smiled giggled slightly, and looked away.

I stood there for a few more seconds, asked her if that ment no, and she shook her head confirming that she wasn't interested. I then apologized for bothering her and left.

As I walked away, I felt better, a lot better, much better than if I never asked her out in the first place. The rejection wasn't bad at all, only the the fear of it. I felt glad that I took the shot, and even though I missed, I would do it again. 

For years I have only stuck to the dating apps, thinking that was how it was done these days (I never see other people ask random people out in public), yet never having much success. Online you don't have the immediate response to your proposal and people rarely outright reject you. You never know who actually swipes left on you. Thus, you don't get that fear of rejection.

Even though I technically failed again in person, I felt accomplished for really putting myself out there in the real world and trying. From now on I am going to try more in person, get out there and give it my best face to face."
So... I apparently have a girlfriend now and we haven’t even met in person yet.,"So a week ago I posted about meeting a woman whose 6 feet tall and I’m only 5’6”. Well we’ve been talking a lot since this whole coronavirus thing started. Well shortly after I made my post she asked me if I had already picked a pet name for her yet. I of course haven’t yet, but of course she did already. Apparently I’m her “Chicken Nugget” because I’m shorter than her. Ha Ha Ha Ha, I said. 

Well last night we got talking for our regular 4 hour video chat session and we started talking about BF/GF status and apparently I have a GF now. I know we haven’t met in person, but conversation flows super easy and I totally feel like I can show her the person I am, and it turns out she’s just as goofy and weird as I am. She has already broken down my facade and she likes it. All I have to say is that I’m pretty excited because she’s totally my type."
What are your “yellow flags” when it comes to dating?,"Yellow flags as in no imminent danger or anything overtly alarming, but still indicators of something not great.

Mine is grown men sending me sad faces if I haven’t replied or if I am otherwise taking a long time to answer (I’m a 22 year old woman and have had men in their forties do this when I wasn’t interested in talking to them). To me it looks childish and manipulative, and is a turnoff almost instantly. 

How about you?"
"On dating apps, ask the women (or men) out as soon as you can, a few days texting is more than enough","So I read it a lot here, that people don't know how to keep a meaningful conversation, how to get to know someone via texting, how to keep someone's attention, etc.

As a woman, what I liked the most when I was using dating apps if we met up immediately. I don't know either the answers for the above questions, I'm not a good texter. But if someone asked me out for a drink or a coffee, I went for it. If it was a 1 hour of coffee date, but it didn't work out, we didn't match in real life, it was one hour of our life. But if it was a good date, that it could last from 5 pm to 3 am, we were happy and we kept dating. But I can not imagine texting with someone for weeks/months before meeting in real life, only to turn out you don't actually like each other in person. I had a guy texting me everyday for like a month, but he never asked me out. I tried to text him as much as I could, but I'm not good in opening up to someone who I didn't even met. And one day, he ghosted me. Seriously, what was it good for? We put one month of effort in it for nothing. Just ask me out, and see if we like each other in person.

And this advice is not just for men, with half of my dates I suggested going out after a few texts."
"I‘m so tired of the “The more you ignore them, the more interested in you the other person gets”. Because it’s so real.","I just realized that at least in my case, this cliché is absolutely true. With every person I’ve dated, the more I play it cool and don’t show too much excitement about seeing them in general, the greater the chances of them wanting to see me and to lead into a relationship.
And it bugs me the most because sometimes I just wanna be straightforward and really show how happy and excited I am about certain someone, but that generally leads to them losing all interest. Playing it cool sucks but also works. Why is this? Is it ingrained in our culture? What’s going on?"
"If someone likes you then you’ll know, if they don’t you’ll be confused","And with that, I don’t have much else to say. As a female, I’m tired of girlfriends saying “oh maybe he’s busy with life for the last week or maybe he’s going through a ruff time -“ and maybe that is true. If he likes you then you’ll know."
My dating story.,"So I started dating again at the beginning of the year and here is how it went. Guy #1 dated me for 5 months and then told me he’d been seeing someone else the whole time. Guy #2 dated me for a few months, slept with me, then ghosted me. This was the first time I’d started dating since my only long-term relationship a couple of years earlier; a guy whom I was with for 5 years that cheated on me multiple times (I’m aware that I sound very negative and bitter by this point, but please bare with).

So back to the present day. I met this new guy about a month ago, guy #3. We went on a few dates and everything was going seemingly well. I went in with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I really liked him. The only thing was, he was incredibly strange. He texted me after our first date to say how much he enjoyed it and that he’d love to see me again. He puts in equal effort to arrange dates that we’ll both enjoy. He texts me every day to find out about my day. He always replies to my messages. He never avoids the hard questions and he’s very open with me. He takes a lot of interest in finding out more about me, the way I think, the things I love, the things I don’t love. He really makes an effort and appreciates the effort I make. It’s all just very, very strange. Right?

WRONG. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. I have wasted so much time waiting around for assholes that I didn’t know what it should actually be like when you are dating someone. I got so used to being ignored, being left on read, going out of my way to make an effort, only to get none in return, feeling annoying rather than wanted, getting dishonest communication or none at all, being made to feel like I wasn’t good enough and that I had to earn the time of others. I was so used to it that I had myself convinced that this was normal. That by speaking up and saying how it upset me, I was being crazy and expecting too much. All of those monumental red flags had become normal to me and instead were not flags at all.

But this...THIS is what it should be like. When someone is genuine and they really do care about you, they don’t do all those things. You won’t have to wonder. You won’t have to feel like you’re not enough for them, that you have to convince them to be with you. I know this may all be nothing short of a platitude but seriously....I feel like after meeting this guy, I have just woken the fuck up.

Moral of the story? Don’t let the assholes fool you into thinking that asshole-ness is normal. It isn’t. It really fucking isn’t."
Just go for it,"Hi guys. I moved too a new village around 6 months ago, around the same time I split up with my ex girlfriend. I have been on a few tinder dates and the girls really were lovely but there was just one thing... In the local supermarket works an absolute gorgeous girl who I've had my eye on ever since I first seen her. She is 100% waaaaay out of my league. The conversations at the checkout we have is amazing and everything just flows naturally compared too anyone else I had been on dates with. Therefore it didn't make me having enough interest into trying too find a partner out of the other girls. All I wanted was this checkout girl! 

I didn't know anything about her personal life (if she had a boyfriend)ect...  so I was pretty nervous about what I did next. Chancing my arm I wrote my name and number on a piece of paper and then proceeded too enter the supermarket not even knowing if she'd be working or not. I grabbed my food and sure enough there she was. I could feel my face going red and the nervs proper kicked in. I was thinking too myself ""do I go ahead with this or not"" but hell what have I got too loose? She finishes serving her customer. Turns too me with her usual gorgeous smile and we go about our conversations like we do most days. At this point just as I am about too pay another customer comes along starts unloading his shopping. This makes me even more nervous knowing that this dude is gonna see what I am about too do.

I said ""*her name* I really enjoy coming into the shop and seeing you. I feel like you are such a lovely genuinely nice person. You are absolutely gorgeous and I would love it if you would like too have a drink with me sometime?"" I could tell by the smile on her face that I had made her day. She was so delighted and accepted my offer *RELIEF* 
I handed her my piece of paper and started walking out the shop. As I turned round she was still grinning from ear too ear and the guy who was stood behind me gave me the nod of approval. Felt like the fucking boss!!

She texted me lastnight and after a few hours speaking we now have a date arranged for Friday. RESULT! 

Just go for it guys. The worst that can happen is being told no. Happy dating and good luck everybody :)"
"This is gonna be my year! I'm finally going to get out there start dating, going to bars and clubs!","*A global viral outbreak happens*
People are being warned to stay indoors and to not to make contact with other people.

Just my luck..."
I am about to go on a date with a very pretty girl.,"I am freaking out. She is definitely a 10. And I am like a 6 on a good day. She is funny, easy going, and very outspoken. I am more anxious than all hell. 

Wish me luck?

Update: Well for everyone telling me to stay home, good news! She stood me up, so I never left.

Update 2: Thank you for the platinum!!

Update 3: I work at a Walmart, by the way. I have a much lower chance at getting the coronavirus when going on a date for a couple hours with one other person who doesn't have it than going to work, where I am there for several hours 5 or 6 days out of the week. I'm sorry that you feel like this is reckless behavior, but I live in a small town and we weren't planning on going anywhere public. If you want to be upset at me for living my youth the best I can during this time, then you're welcome to do that. Also this isn't really pedestalling, I am just intimated by how I percieve her beauty. I'm sorry if you feel this is cringe-worthy but we can't all have high self-esteems."
"Would people be interested in a blind dating app where you match based on real time voice conversations, rather than just pictures?","Hi all! I've been spending this quarantine working on a dating app that flips the script on traditional dating apps–instead of filtering first on pictures, the app I've made matches based on real time voice conversations that you have with your dates. After you match, you can continue the conversation and once you feel more comfortable with your partner, you can reveal your profiles. Some of my family and friends have described it as the Netflix show ""Love is Blind"" in app form.

The app is actually out and ready, but I don't want to drop the name of the app here without the moderator's approval. If you're interested, DM me and I can send you a link (or if you're a mod, I would really appreciate approval). I feel like a lot of posts that I've read here are related to traditional dating app fatigue and this is definitely a very different app! It really does feel more fun to use than just swiping. Would love to know your thoughts and hope you're having a wonderful weekend!"
How do you not get attached so quickly when dating?,"Sometimes when I am starting to talk to someone and we click, I notice myself getting really excited and begin painting a future together. I think about dates, first kisses, what the sex will be like, meeting each other’s friends, etc. I just go down a rabbit hole of wander. This is always of course unbeknownst to the other party and I always keep my cool as much as I can around them but that doesn’t go to say that I don’t still have these thoughts or talk to my best friend about it.

9 times out of 10 things never pan out with the guy like I anticipated and I always get my hopes up. Even after going through this cycle many times, it seems to always happen, even knowing it very likely may happen again, and I still don’t know how to not get giddy when it seems like a guy is really into me and I start wondering if I finally found the one.

It’s just so disappointing and discouraging to feel so certain that it’s going to work out with someone only for it to go south.

To those of you who have experienced this, how do you prevent this from happening and keep your cool?"
Probably the most romantic close to a date I've ever had.,"Just thought I'd come through with some positivity and get the spirits up in line with the new year. I (27M) went on a date with someone I met on Hinge at the beginning of December and it was probably the best date I've ever had. We had donuts, went bowling, and topped it all off with soul food. At the end I asked to walk her home and she agreed. During the walk we were asking each other arbitrary questions the whole way up until we got to her place where before we parted I asked ""So... last question of the night.."". She then said ""Uh-oh"" and I started to panic a little bit and said ""Oh man, by your answer that tells me I maybe shouldn't ask it!"" and she said ""No, it's because I already know the question!"". I was a little taken a back but simple responded ""Oh? Well... what's the answer then?"" and she then grabbed my coat and kissed me. The air was cold and still, and when we were done her ears were red. It was perhaps the most romantic thing I've experienced in a long time.

tldr: Had a great date that ended in a great kiss. 2020 is lookin' up!

Edit: I'm really surprised by the response of this post; and grateful how positive most of it has been. Thank you all. You're too kind. For people having difficulty with matches on certain apps, I've mentioned it a few times but Hinge is perhaps one of the best (in my opinion) for finding a relationship so I would seriously consider it if you haven't already."
"I thought dating was to get to know *each other*, not just one person asking the other questions.","Trying online dating, and so far the experience has been: 

me: asking them question, 
we have conversation, 
me: ask another question

Please ask me a question! I want to know that you have stuff you're looking for in a person, and not just... match what I need."
Omg I just asked out my crush 😵,"Hey guys, I just asked out my best friend on a date and she said yes. We agreed that after quarantine ends we’re gonna go to the lake and go paddle boarding. Idk who else to tell but I’m honestly so excited!! 😀😀"
Dating as a taller than average woman is tiring,"I went on a date today where I didnt know how tall the guy was. It took me an hour to get to our meeting point. I had to wait for him, so I saw him coming from a distance (he told me what he was wearing so I could spot him).. we said hi to each other, he looked up to me (he wasn't even that short; just shorter than me), immediately took out his phone, called someone, received some messages and said he had to leave - all of this in a matter of about 2 minutes. So I drove back home.

But there's one thing i dont understand: in the bio I specifically wrote my height because I get it. Some dudes dont like tall women. No problem with that. But please, the info is there so they can weed me out before trying to meet me..."
"If there's one positive I've found from this quarantine, it's that a video date for a first date is a great idea","Takes a ton of pressure off, it's perfectly acceptable to make it short, you focus on conversation more than anything, and if the vibe is off or the person doesn't look like their profile, you spent $0 and didn't even have to leave the house. I think I may incorporate this into my regular dating practice tbh."
Do not mistake good costumer service with flirting.,"Hello everyone! 

I have seen multiple post where someone asks if they should ask a certain worker out beacuse they felt a connection, they were being nice, charming, ect. As a female who has worked at a theme park I have had men ask me out daily as I’m sure a lot of other females can relate to. It comes off as incredibly creepy and can often times make us feel uncomfortable. It’s sad how to most people this isn’t obvious and the reason why I felt compelled to make this post. Of course asking someone out doesn’t hurt anyone but please don’t take me being nice to you as flirting especially when I am working and this is my job.

Edit - Thank you for all the amazing people who are sharing their stories :) I am astonished at the amount of sexism in the comments. This should be common knowledge. It is honestly shameful how some people are being and it’s a sign that things need to change. When we smile at you we aren’t flirting, we are at our jobs to earn money. We as customer service workers absolutely have the right to feel safe. The fact the we could risk our jobs by telling a delusional creep to fuck off is absolutely unacceptable. It’s sad that I am not surprised by the response from a majority of the men. Thank you to all the people who understand the point of view of the worker."
The Constant Burden of Performance as a Guy,"Any other men just completed exhausted not only trying to be ""that confidence, charismatic"" guy when talking to women and during dates.

All I want to do is get to know someone and have a good time, if anything comes out of it its a bonus, that's how I view dates.  But I always feel like there is this additional expectation that I am charming/charismatic/ultra confident/witty. And whenever I fail to meet this expectation is when women run

This is coming from times I've met women and heard they were not interested because I was ""a little more shy"" or ""I didn't project my voice enough"" or ""they met someone more charming"". It  doesn't help that I'm bombarded with advice from female friends, from youtube dating coaches and from society about how they just LOVEEEE charming charismatic men. nothing more attractive than a man who has is back arched back, talks in DEEP MANLY VOICE THATS SLOW, throws a witty one liner every now and then.  Any semblance of anxiety - nope - instant ladyboner killer. nervous on a first date? (oh god forbid you are a little nervous when on a first date.) - better NOT SHOW IT otherwise its OVER.

Ok, I Get. we all have to play the part. Women spending all this time on makeup/hair/clothes to look good for dates/to go out.

But as a natural introvert, its completely exhausting."
"""No matter how attractive a person's potential may be","...you have to date their reality.""

I just read that and it hit home. Thought I'd share it.

I just recently dated someone who simply wasn't ready to get involved with *anyone* because of a recent breakup. 

I had (or if I'm honest still have to some degree) a hard time dealing with the fact that timing just wasn't in our favor because we really clicked and I was so sad over the fact that it just wasn't meant to be.

But the thing is... Sometimes things just can't work out.

No matter how good you two would be together, how much you click, how much chemistry you have with each other, how attracted you are to each other, how well you fit together...

Sometimes it's just not meant to be because your realities just don't match up. For reasons unknown.

It's nobody's fault really. It's not that you're not good enough. It's not that you did or say something wrong. Sometimes timings a bitch. Sometimes the other person isn't in the right emotional state. Sometimes their circumstances get in the way. Whatever.

And in that moment your self respect has to be stronger than your feelings.

Don't beg. Don't discuss it. Don't force yourself back into their lives. Don't argue.

They probably made a healthy decision for themselves. Even if you can't wrap your head around it. Most of the time it's probably not an easy decision for them either. But it's probably a healthy one for you too. Whether you know it or not, you probably wouldn't want to be involved with them while whatevers going on, that prevents you from being with them, is going on, anyway.

So let them go.

Maybe you'll find each other again under the right circumstances - but don't count on it. Let them go completely and just live your life. Close this chapter and open a new one."
The one who cares less controls the relationship,Don’t let someone play with your feelings. You are worth alot and your rights/opinions matter in a relationship! You deserve better
"What do you want, a cookie for behavior that you should exude by default?","So, I had a date last night. 

We’ll call him Jacob. I’ve texted and talked on the phone with Jacob over the course of 2 weeks or so. He seemed sweet and pretty fun. We finally found the time to set up a date. His use of the word date came as a surprise to me, because I dunno, I’ve been single a long time and I’m just not used to men actually looking for something other than sex. 

It took me about 3 hours to get ready. Yes, excessive. But, I like to go all out when I’m happy or feel like I’m on track. I felt very confident in my appearance, but I wouldn’t say I was looking for negative attention. Not that that even matters. 

First off, I pull into the restaurant, get out of my car, and BOOM. There he is. It struck me as creepy. I didn’t tell him what I drive. Second, I find myself feeling awful because I’ve interacted with this dude for weeks, we’ve sent multiple Snapchats back and forth and... I am not attracted to his real life self. I can’t put my finger on what was different? 

Anyhow, we go in and get seated and he immediately wants to talk about man thing. Cars mostly. That’s fine and all but I had no idea what he was saying. He didn’t seem like the type of person that bothers to explain things, he just likes to talk. Maybe he was nervous. 

As the date goes on, he says various things that just aren’t attractive. He made jokes about jerking off and sex. Just things that generally tend to be an immediate turn off for me. Then, back to hot wiring cars. I think I got whiplash...

He also says that he is recently divorced. So recently, that he signed papers last week. That to me seemed a little swift to be moving back into things. He proceeds to ask me if we can go sit in my car after dinner just to talk more. I don’t know why all my internal sirens started blaring but I instantly felt uneasy. I kinda swept the question under the rug and deferred to a new subject. 

Dinner is done (and I feel horribly relieved that it’s almost over) so I ask if he’s ready to go because I’m beginning to feel the effects of a migraine. At this point, we go outside and we’re standing by my car. He brings up the same question he had earlier and I tried to push it off, saying my car was really dirty. He was insistent that he didn’t care. 

Now, I start getting a little bit defensive... I told him I really just wanted to take dating slowly. He said he respected that, but was obviously very disappointed. He then says he hasn’t had sex since Thanksgiving. 

Insert meme of crazy haired white lemur raising its hands like ‘what the fuck?’ It’s really not my problem... 
I said my head was hurting and it was time for me to be in bed anyways. 

“Well I guess I’m gonna go beat one out in my truck real quick.” All I could reply was oh my god... 

He asked for a kiss and I straight up said no. He kinda got a little louder in tone asking why not. All I could get out was “that’s not really my thing.” So he asks for a hug. To appease him and go home, I let him have a hug, he did buy me dinner after all. 

Pulling back, he says “see, I didn’t try to touch your butt or be inappropriate.” 

I said “do you want a goddamn gold star?” and I got in my car and left. 

I am never seeing this dude again and as bad as I feel for thinking this, it was a waste of some bomb ass makeup. Needless to say, I am once again back in this same hole I keep trying to crawl out of. I’m so discouraged."
Trying to find a significant other in 2019 is like trying to discover antibiotics during the bubonic plague,"I'm telling you man.

It's like this balancing act. Well, before the balancing act it's trying to find someone you share some kind of interest in, be it physical or emotional attraction. If you're lucky, both.

Then you gotta be in the right PLACE at the right TIME...

K, then you like each other. You hang out. Then you suppress emotions so you don't scare the other off, so you overthink. ""They haven't responded yet, fuck are they ghosting me?"" ""They're probably just sleeping"" ""If you don't stop thinking about them you're gonna jinx it"" ""Did I jinx it"" ""Oh wait, everything's chill"" ""I just hung out with them it's fine"" ""I like them but I can't tell them because it'll freak 'em out"" ""The sex was AMAZING"" 

Or maybe you don't like them. Then it's... shit, maybe I just don't like them because they're not my ""type"" so, I should consider them. Broaden my horizons. I like their flaws, I can do this. Then you end up leading them on. You never liked them. Wasted time. Maybe you soft ghost 'em, maybe you ghost 'em, maybe you just tell them and break their heart. \*(Edit based off replies- I shoulda included it anyway:) Maybe you're honest and they're fine with it- best option. I've got the other side of that though, I'm honest and they retaliate and keep trying thinking they can sway me. Or on the other side of the coin, they're honest with me and then change their mind, then it's a whole head fuck.\*

It's insanity. I just want to skip that whole annoying ""getting to know each other through texting because it's 2019"" and the whole ""balancing act"" and the whole wasting each other's time by not being up front... to that comfortable stage. I mean sure, I love the honeymoon stage too when you're fuckin' every day on the kitchen counter, the floor, the couch, sittin' on the same side of the booth when you eat Thai food and making everyone around you absolutely nauseous... But the comfortable stage... I wanna leave you little notes for when you wake up saying have a good day without it being weird, I wanna surprise you when you come home, completely naked, and not have it weird I snuck into your house. I wanna be able to cook together and when we digest a little bit we can still bang. I wanna not text all day and just talk to you when we're off work. I wanna give you a gift when I think of you, I wanna be able to vent to you and you to me without feeling like I'm dropping too much on you. I just wanna love you, man.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Refer to title, and we should ban texting after you first meet for at least a month. Talk to each other in person or on the phone so shit don't get misconstrued and you ain't waitin' for a fucking response or not responding, whatever."
"Dating conversation tip: practice ""deep listening"" — here's how","This is a tip for people who struggle with conversation from time to time.

Try to practice ""deep listening"" — this means allowing people to say what’s on their mind and listening to it with real curiosity and attention, without waiting for your turn to talk. Then ask questions that reflect back what the person is saying.

It may seem obvious to some, but others have the tendency to start thinking about their response while the other person is still talking. If you focus on listening rather than crafting your own response, conversation will come more naturally.

Do you have any tips for better listening and conversation flow?"
The “who cares the most?” game is so annoying,"Who’s texting the most content? Who’s taking the longest to respond? Who’s double texting? Who’s replying again when they don’t respond? Who likes who the most? Who’s the most valuable? Who’s desperate? Who wants this the most? Who cares the most?

Oh you don’t care? Bye."
I miss innocence/youthfulness in dating/romance,"I don’t know if this is even the right place for this post, but I felt the need to get this off my chest. Im a 27 year old male, have only been in about 1.5 real relationships and a couple of young heartbreaks/unrequited love situations.

I found myself reading the initial messages between myself and the first girl i “loved” when i was 18 years old. Classic case of became best friends, had way too many feelings, we couldn’t date for a variety of reasons (religions, family, etc). Eventually I couldn’t handle being just friends and it blew up.

But reading the messages just left me with a huge void for a couple of reasons. 1. The idealistic view I had of love and relationships at that age that has seemingly been destroyed by breakups and failures and heartbreak and aging. I understand that’s a part of growing up and it is normal to view romance and relationships different at 27 versus 18, but it leaves me with a bad feeling nonetheless. 2. I miss how innocent it was. How pure it was. There was no pretense or alternative interpreted meaning behind our conversations. There was no pressure.

Since that time, among other things, I have app dated a lot. Like >60 first dates a lot. And this has seemingly beaten down the aspects that made me so hopeful and joyful about love and relationships to begin with. It has become so formulaic, even when it is moderately successful. The dates are grossly similar, the conversations blur together. Always preparing to be ghosted at any given moment. Always prepared to throw copious amounts of money on a date with someone I may very well never see at again. And at its best, it just becomes this pattern of going on a few dates, before feeling pressured that its time for intimacy/physical intimacy or to decide if this relationship is going anywhere. 

I guess this is more of a way to write my feelings out then seeking any specific advice or guidance. I do wonder if any of you out there feel the same way and if so how you deal with it. How do you find ways to keep youthfulness and innocence in your dating life?"
Girls ends it with me after I bring up concerns over her never offering to pay,"Did I dodge a bullet here?

I went on 3 dates with a girl who never once offered to pay for anything. I kind of gave her a pass on the first 2 since she drove 25 minutes ( I paid her to park since there is no street parking) to come see me and we always had a great time. I absolutely would not have let her pay but I still think she should have at least made an offer, but I was not too worried about it. On the third date, we went somewhere closer to her that she picked. We agreed on just drinks but shortly before the date, she told me she was hungry and she ended up ordering food while I ate dinner beforehand but got something small so she didn't feel weird.

We had a great time again but does not offer to contribute and then a few minutes later makes a comment about how I don't pay for her ubers to and from dates, while other guys she had gone out with did. She claims it was a joke but the timing was pretty poor so I was annoyed and the date ended pretty awkwardly shortly after.

The next day I let her know that I was pretty insulted by her comment because it's important to me that a girl offers to at least do something as little as pay for a round of drinks over the course of 3 dates, so to make a comment like that really hit a nerve. I told her I would not have even let her pay at this point, but the offer is a nice gesture that goes a long way with me and is very reassuring to me that I’m not being used as a meal ticket.

She then basically says ""I'm sorry you feel that way about me offering to buy a round of drinks but I don't really have much else to say"" and also makes a comment about this situation being immature and tells me that she'd like to end things. 

I'm pretty bummed because we connected really well and I was extremely attracted to her. But at the same time, I feel like I also dodged a bullet."
"Ever miss someone that was once interested in you, wish they still were and/or wondering if they ever will be again?","Flair: half venting and half discussion 

I’m especially talking someone who initiated/showed interest in you first, you liked them back, and they either lost interest or got with someone else (and lost interest after getting with that someone else).  Especially in cases of either almost dating or dating briefly.   And with the former especially, without properly dating at all, it’s painful because you go from clicking to almost being strangers.  There was a potential for a connection that didn’t come to fruition-even when you try staying friends you guys are now at ground zero since you only barely got to know each other.  You’re stuck with all these feelings to the point that it seems too good to be true that this person was interested in you a while back, despite them having to pursue you/even if they were quite keen on you back then.  Hearing stories of people who met the person they used to like and having those feelings resurface make you wonder if the one in your case will ever be interested again, but the fact that they changed their mind about dating you makes it doubtful."
I asked a guy out. I did it guys.,"I asked a guy out for drinks. We met up. He paid even tho I asked him out, totally prepared to pay for everything. And now we are officially dating. I took a chance. I went ham. I said fuck my insecurities. 

I landed a unicorn. He has respected all of my boundaries. He asks questions. He does not judge me for my past. Its incredible. 

Just go for it. Ask that guy out. Ask that girl out. The worst thing is they say no and you move on. Do it. You should be happy. But you will never know until you try.

Edit: I am a girl. An over weight girl at that.

Edit 2: I appreciate every single one of you. And it's so uplifting and moving to see that I could inspire even a few people. You are all worth more than you believe you are. Even just pretending that you feel that way can inspire change inside of you. That's what I did and it worked. Good luck my loves!"
I hate dating because it's one aspect of my life I have no control over,"At least from a guys perspective, men in society are told early in their life that accomplishments make them desirable.

When you're young, it's easy to understand life trajectory that makes you desirable through accomplishments:

For me it was:

1. Do well in High School, so that you can...
2. Go to College, do well in college so that you can...
3. Get a job (or get a Masters--my path), so that you can
4. Get a better job in the city
5. ??????????????   \[This step is where I am right now\]

Now that I actually have an office job that I enjoy, now what? 

I know I want to meet someone, but it's not a straightforward path. There isn't like a list of steps for me to complete to guarantee that I will find someone. As someone that's driven by accomplishments that's the hardest thing about dating. You truly have no control over making someone like you--as we all know, being nice doesn't guarantee attraction."
Please Be Honest On Your Profiles,"Like please, pretty please be freaking honest on your profiles.

Not single and looking for a third or in a open long distance relationship? Please put that on your bio

Single but not looking for a relationship? Put that on your bio

Got a kid? Pleaseeee put that on your bio as well. 

I’m tired of matching with women on dating apps and have them not being truthful about their intentions or leaving small things out on their bios. 

I literally stopped talking to a woman after finding out after weeks of talking and on going on three dates that she’s in a open long distance relationship!! Like what the hell?!

So please, for the love of God be honest on your damn profile.

Thanks 🤦🏽‍♀️"
"I hate when I’m honest about what I’m looking for from the very beginning, the guy seems totally okay with it and then he goes against my boundaries.","If someone tells you that they’re looking to take things slow and they’re not interested in hooking up right away, BELIEVE THEM and don’t try to change their minds. Don’t even think you can change their minds. It’s such a turn off and it’s obnoxious. 

I had a first date with someone recently, I made it very clear that I was looking to take things slow. I asked him what he was looking for and he said he was looking for a relationship for the long term. Which was great cause that’s what I’m also looking for. He seemed to be totally fine and okay with me wanting to take things slow. He also is aware that I’m still a Virgin and I explained why (basically I had not so great relationships in the past and didn’t feel comfortable sleeping with them, and one had medical issues that got in the way). He seemed to respect that and still wanted to keep seeing me. Well, date one we go back to his place for a movie and he tries mauling me. Very very touchy feely, and I had to tell him to stop. He apologized, said he hoped he wasn’t coming on too strong, blah blah. Well I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and we went out again the next day. Rinse and repeat. Same shit, but even more so. Told him to chill, he apologized and then when he dropped me off at home I got a lengthy text about him coming off too strong again and that he just can’t help it because he found me to be really attractive and blamed it on his “animal instincts” but said if it happens again I can “put him in his place” and he’ll stop again. And I’m thinking, why do I have to constantly tell him to stop when I’ve already told him multiple times to stop, and when I already made it clear before we met up that I’m not looking to rush things?! Well, 2 days later and it’s date 3. Saaammmeee shit. However outside of that our dates were amazing! But now he’s not responding to me anymore and when he dropped me off last time I saw him I can just tell that there was something wrong. I got a feeling. And now, just no responses. 

So I’m assuming all the nice and sweet stuff he said to me throughout the entire time we were talking was just bullshit and he just wanted to low key try to get me to change my mind about the physical stuff cause he was a horny horn dog. And when he realized after 3 dates that it wasn’t happening, he gave up??? IT WAS 3 DATES! Holy moly. Cause everything else was fine. So I’m baffled if that wasn’t the reason for his ghosting. 

So really. If someone says they wanna take things slow, believe them. If casual sex is all you want then go for someone who actually wants casual sex. and not someone who’s also a damn Virgin if you can’t wait more 6 days lol. 

Keep in mind this guy acted like he was genuinely interested in me, met my mom, I met his parents, constantly texting me, wanted to hangout all the time, made plans for the near future once things open up again, told me I made him really happy, was always excited to see me or hear from me... and for what??? It was a lie to try and get laid? Come on."
10 Lessons Learned from Dating Over a Year (Male Perspective),"Hello all, decided to give the male perspective for dating and how to shift through toxicity as a heterosexual guy. (Niceguys, this may help you lol)

&#x200B;

**1.) Don't send millions of messages.** Please don't do this. Aside from looking desperate, when you send too many messages at one time, you actually race through the conversation. It makes it hard to stay on topic and ruins the flow of a conversation. It also makes it less likely she'll actually read everything you wrote.

**2.) Don't be afraid to send more than one message.** This is not a contradiction to **rule 1**. Basically, don't feel like there are strict dating rules you have to follow. If there is a topic you are really interested in and passionate about, don't be afraid to seem excited to talk about certain topics. God forbid you might actually show some personality instead of just looking like a ""cool guy"".

**3.) Don't waste your time with girls that give short replies or act like they don't wanna talk.** If a girl doesn't seem interested in the conversation, just stop. It takes two people to talk.

**4.) Don't let her act like she's cooler than you.** This one is worded a bit funny but all I mean is that don't let her behave like you're always the one that needs to impress her. Most girls actually have ZERO game. That's because it's usually guys that hit on them. This lets them sit back and act like they are above it all sometimes.

**5.) Don't be afraid of silences**. <-- This is something confident people easily pull off. If you're always talking on a date, trust me, the other person notices it. People who are afraid of moments of silence come across as insecure and often times they are. Slow your pace when you talk, give her time to answer questions and when she does answer, don't immediately jump in as soon as she's done. Give her time to elaborate and make her feel like the ownership of the conversation is also on her. This is a major power dynamic when first meeting someone. Similar to **rule 4**, don't feel like you always need to impress her. Let her impress you. (If you're super into the topic then don't be afraid to talk more but as a general rule, slow your pace down and put her in a position where she feels like she needs to speak.)

**6.) How does she behave? How does she treat you and others around her?** One of the best indicators of a person's character is how they treat people they don't care about or that can't do anything for them. If she's inconsiderate when you first meet, then she's inconsiderate. That's not going to get better. (Do not mistake ppl being uninterested with inconsideration. Inconsideration is when you two are dating or if you two know each other. Uninterested is when she ain't interested in dating you or when you're just a guy in her DMs. Both cases, you should walk away.)

**7.) Know what you're looking for.** Are you looking for a relationship or sex? We all have our own dating rules, so if you're looking for a relationship, pay attention to how she presents herself to the world and her boundaries. No offense ladies, but if a girl gets sexual with me immediately, that's a strike against her as far as a relationship goes. I've had girls send me nudes within 20 minutes of talking.  If she gets sexual with you right off the bat, you need to decide whether that information would cause problems later on if you decided to date her. This is where **rule** **6** comes into play. If she's really a great person then lots of guys will still consider her gf material.

**8.) Don't put her on a pedestal.** Similar to **rule 4**. It's called a partner, not a boss. If you're always sucking up to her or telling her how amazing she is and how beautiful she is, she won't like you. Flip the tables, what if you had a guy friend always telling you how cool you are and how unworthy he is to be your friend? You'd probably be like yeahhhhh he's a nice guy but he's a suck up. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our friends. It's the same with relationships. We want people who view themselves as our equals to be our partners. No one likes a suck up.

**9.) Don't pretend to be something you're not.** It's hard to be yourself with someone you've just met. But it's much easier to avoid pretending to be something you're not. If you like video games or if you hate clubbing (like me), don't be scared that you'll look nerdy. I've had girls who had pictures of them clubbing tell me that they actually didn't really like it that much and they only did it cause there was nothing else to do sometimes. Don't try and look cool by lying about your interests.

**10.) Be a decent human being.** There is a big difference between being nice and being kind. Try and be both if you can but if you are nice to someone don't only be nice hoping to get something out of it. Regardless of what happens, relationships, friendships, strangers, etc, the effort of being a good person even when it's hard is a reward in and of itself. If you let yourself get nasty too many times then eventually you'll just be a nasty person. Actions become habits and habits become part of who you are.

&#x200B;

**Bonus Rule:** I've seen on niceguy videos where they will narrate themselves during texts. Yeah...don't do that.

I have a tendency to elaborate so probably made this longer than necessary but because it's Reddit, I figured the less misunderstandings the better."
I think it’s such horseshit when people say “be happy you’re single because relationships are hard”.,"Yeah no shit relationships are gonna be hard. NOTHING in life that is good is easy to obtain and keep. Might as well say “be happy that you’re unemployed because having a job is hard” or “be happy you’re uneducated because school is hard” or “be happy you have no friends because keeping friendships is hard”

I see candid pics of couples together who are truly happy and I think it’s bullshit that they would think *I* should be happy that I’m single and that them being together is hard. And if they think I would happier as single then they’re hypocrites for being in a relationship themselves.

Edit: wow thanks for the gold! I didn’t expect this post to blow up like this."
Being someone’s rebound sucks. Don’t start dating if you’re not over your ex.,"All I can say is this situation absolutely sucks. I (23yo) met this guy (24m). I wasn’t really looking to date but he was very persistent and I was bored one evening and so I agreed to go to dinner. He was amazing! We got on so well he really surprised me. We would text all day every day and we started seeing each other every other day roughtly. 
We’re in bed together and I’m almost asleep and he whispers that he loves me! (Im very sure he thought i was asleep and couldn’t hear me!) I was so gassed I thought maybe I’d finally found someone I want to be in a relationship with. 
Fast forward a month and we’re in bed together. Completely out of the blue he says he doesn’t want anything serious because he “is over his ex but not over the relationship”. She left him for someone else and the way he talked about her he go so defensive he’s clearly still in love with her!! 
I’m completely heart broken - I never had a chance with this guy. And what really pisses me off is I never even initiated anything!!! I wouldn’t have fell for him if he hadn’t come on so strong with me!!! 
Side note: anyone else think that when he whispered I love you to me he was pretending I was his ex cos I can’t stop thinking about it! 

Anyways I have become a crazy person because of this situation. Needed to rant. That actually feels loads better!!"
My dating journey as an ugly guy: from rough beginnings to decent ends,"As an ugly person, it has been painful but also rewarding to accept my place.

It was challenging to accept the truth and consequences of my appearance.  Society places enormous emphasis on appearances.  People everywhere will judge you and treat you negatively based on appearance, no matter how intelligent/educated/nice they believe themselves to be.  So it can be very depressing to open your eyes and see how many people discriminate against you (usually just in subtle ways, thankfully).

The reality of my ugliness dawned on me very slowly.  I noticed how my attractive friends were treated better than me in public-- random people would commonly make friendly eye contact with them or even smile at them, which has never happened for me.  I would be excluded from certain conversations or events.  I saw myself ageing much more harshly than other guys my age.  I noticed that I was usually the least attractive person in group photos.  Needless to say, I struggled to find girls to date, or even talk to.  Eventually, it was no longer possible to delude myself.

I also really struggled with the idea that, even though I'm ugly, maybe I can still find an attractive mate.  I got over that through numerous painful dating experiences and by observing how couples usually have similar levels of attractiveness.  I have learned that, if you want to ""date up"", there is a very low ceiling on ""up"", and that ceiling can only be broken if you allow yourself to be exploited in some way (e.g. maybe they want your money or status, or maybe they are just a psycho trying to hurt you).

Once I got past these painful truths, a deeper truth also dawned on me: that there are girls who, just like me, are straight and also tired of getting mistreated based on appearances.  Knowing that, I found it much easier to find high-potential mates and treat them kindly.  I knew I could treat them the way I wanted to be treated, and that they would appreciate it.  By focusing on that mantra, I was able to not only avoid painful interactions, but also make new friends, enjoy the company of women on casual dates, and eventually, I found a romantic relationship.

There are so many good possibilities out there, even if your appearance isn't good.  For anyone who is struggling out there, I hope my story is helpful!"
I love getting ghosted,"Yes you heard that right. Ghost me I will not care! I will not double text you! I will not be sad about it! Why? Because why the HELL would I want to continue trying to pursue someone who obviously isn't interested in me? When someone ghosts me I say YAY now I know that me and this person aren't meant to be, so now I'm one step closer to finding someone who is. I'm never going to let someone make me question if I'm pretty enough, interesting enough, or smart enough for them. If they decide they don't want to pursue me anymore they can be my guest. I'm a 19 year old girl and I'm proud of myself for realizing this now, and not letting every rejection turn my world upside down. :)"
How do people actually find their spouse/life partner?,"I look around at all of my friends and sisters and other family members who are married or in a LTR and sometimes get existential about how these couples actually found each other. 

After my (24F) few unsuccessful experiences in dating so far, it blows my mind how people actually find someone who wants to go on a first date together. 

And it goes so well that both people want to go on a second date. And a third date. And a fourth date. And they are both so equally into each other, that they become an official couple. And then they get to further know each other and build mutual trust and affection. And eventually they decide that they are so compatible that they want to spend their lives together. 

From my experience in dating, I sometimes get existential about how its even possible that anyone finds love and finds their person in a sea of people who are not into you, ghost, are emotionally unavailable, have mixed signals or string you along, then leave.

I definitely don't have any harsh feelings towards anyone who does find their life partner, if anything, it's very encouraging that it's possible. It's more just baffling to me that for some people, all of this dating stuff actually works out."
Went on my first date in a year and he fell asleep before our date. I told him to forget it.,"Put myself back out there, after a whole year since my last relationship ended. I finally landed a guy I thought may be worth my time and then get stood up. I was excited, I shaved everything, I did my hair and makeup and found a cute outfit. All for a loser like my ex. My ex had me wait 2 hours for him our first dat, said he'd be there in 20 and 20 turned into 2 hours!! I shouldve left. I didn't and relationship failed in the end. From the beginning he didn't give a damn. So thats why I didn't give this guy a 2nd chance. First impressions mean everything for sure. I don't need another version of my ex. He sounded so unapologetic on the phone when I called to see where he was. Didnt say sorry until i told him to forget it. It hurts, im embarrassed, and i cried, but I'm glad he showed his true colors on day one. I'm waving the litte white flag on dating. I deleted the apps. What was i thinking!? Trash is everywhere. I know you have to go through a few bad ones to get to the good. But I dont have any motivation to continue to get my heart played with. I enjoy not shaving and not wasting my time. So I'm done..until next time.

EDIT: for those that want the details this is how everything went. He asked me if he could come over yesterday,  I said let's meet in public first, he arranged date for that night at a sushi place, we agreed to talk soon, I text im on my way, get no response,  so keep driving hoping he just wasn't responding because he was driving too, i get there, text him ive arrived, wait another 10 mins, so I call him. Then he answers and says he fell asleep and he ""knew this would happen"" when he fell asleep at 4:30 (date was at 6:30) I go okay maybe we can reschedule or maybe we should forget it, but thats when he started to say what time is it? ""Oh its 6:46, what time did we say we were gonna meet?"" (After HE planned it for 6:30) I then said I'm already here and he goes ""no youre not! You did not drive there"" and im like yes i did, I drove all this way! He goes ""Oh man you can hang up on me now i know you're probably mad"" so I tell him to forget it. That's when he says I'm sorry I was a sleepy boy and I say okay bye. And hang up. He then snapchats me saying sorry again for being a sleepy boy. Kinda wierd but I accepted the apology and told him good luck with the next one. The end haha."
Thank You to the guys who do this while dating. [gratitude list],"I've been pretty negative as of late, but I wanted to write a post on all the great things that guys are doing while dating.

1.) I really love it when you set up a date and then tell me you have somewhere to be in a couple hours. This way, I'm free to have fun without feeling like if I smile too much, I'm inadvertently inviting you back to my place or obligated to have sex. (I know I don't have to, but this just makes it so much more comfortable)

&#x200B;

2.) Thank you for complimenting me on something other than my looks. It sounds really vain, but if you're a little bit pretty, that's all guys tell you. It sometimes feels like the rest of me doesn't matter. But when guys tell me I'm funny or a great conversationalist, I feel like they really like Me (and not a temporary thing that makes me lucky). 

&#x200B;

3.) Thank you for asking questions. I so appreciate someone who is interested in me and not just what I can do for them. I always notice even if I don't say much.

&#x200B;

4.) Thank you for not giving me all the power. I love it when guys are confident enough to argue a little bit. I don't want to feel as if you think I could break over the slightest 'no'. I like a little bit of teasing. It makes me feel more equal.

&#x200B;

5.) Thank you for meeting me at a place that's accessible to both of us. I love being able to rely on myself and this is just one of those nice little things that men sometimes do to make me feel more comfortable.

Dating can be really tough and it's easy to get down by the whole process. I truly am appreciative of the efforts. Even if I don't say them out loud, I think about them and I remember them. (and I write them down here)"
I’ve been asking guys out on dates.,"And it’s glorious!! I highly recommend. There was this one guy I knew was interested in me in college/asked me out at one point but I denied him because I wasn’t interested and had a long term boyfriend. I recently saw him at a party. We spent hours catching up and I messaged him the day after and asked if he wanted to grab a drink. When we went on the date he was telling me how he had already planned on asking me out but I beat him to it!! He said he was shocked because a girl had never asked him out before! 

Anyways.. ladies. Don’t hold back. The biggest catastrophe is being turned down. Shoot ya shot.. it could really be worth it!!

I have my second date with him tomorrow. I tried dating a few different people but there’s been zero connection. I’m anxious and excited about this all! 😬"
I officially have a girlfriend! (and so can you),"I(27m) am and always have been a super awkward guy.  I've always had horrible depression and have had trouble making friends.  You can't really imagine how effed up i was.  Crying all the time, super fatalistic, suicidal ideation... i had it all...  Plus I'm fat and ugly.  About 18 months ago I wanted to turn that part of my life around.  So I asked for help.  I'm a PhD student at a large university so I went into the mental health office to get triaged.  They found me a nurse practitioner at the university to handle medications for depression and anxiety.  They also refered me to a therapist in the next town over, and to the university's autism center, since I wanted to get screened for that.

Slow but steady progress over the next year, and then we land at july of 2019.  Social issues are part of my problem, and although I had gotten better I wanted to push more.  I joined a knitting group to get some practice with casual conversation, and find a group with which to work on my hobby.  After that, I wanted to find more social contact, but I also realized that someday I might want to start a family.  If I don't start now, I might never be ready...  So I got on OLD.

Over the next 4 months i was able to get about 4 first dates.  The first one was nice, but I was a little awkward.  The second one I really liked, but she wasn't into me; we're still friends though and occasionally text about crafting projects.  The third one went fine, but she decided to cut off contact.

Now for number 4.  As a man, the optimum strategy on OLD is to swipe right on everyone without looking, and filter later.  The yield is so small.  But we all know that occasionally, someone catches your eye.  You look at her pictures, read her bio, then realize that it would never happen, then you go back to swiping right.  In online dating, hope should be general, not specific.  To my surprise, someone who I had paused on ended up liking me back.  She(25f) seemed really enthusiastic and the text convo in the app was easy.  She complied when I suggest we move to phone text and then we scheduled a first date.  She was even more amazing in person.  She is as smart as anyone I've ever met (with a masters degree in a scientific field), super well versed in music history, had a sense of humour similar to mine, and she was very pretty.  We had lunch, walked around town, then found a nice place to sit and chat.  We lost track of time and ended up racking up over 6 hours.  Since then we texted pretty much every day, and had in person dates every other week (we live across town and are both fairly busy). Yesterday we had date 4, and we planned this to be a big one.  We decided to get dressed up and go to the symphony and get a nice dinner beforehand.  After dinner we start walking to the operahouse, but before we get to far, I pull out the jokes.

""I have something for you.  Give me your hand.""  She puts her hand on mine and I put a lime on hers. She looks confused.  I say, “That was just an excuse to hold your hand.”  She laughs.  I then say “That was my pick up lime.”  She then offers me her hand as we walk to the operahouse.

After the show we go back to my car, and i offer to drive her to her car, parked a few blocks away.  That is when we had the talk.  We just talk for like an hour about various things...  Starting with establishing that we want to be official.  After a nice conversation, we drive over to her car.  I get out to give her a hug goodnight... but somehow we just can't say goodbye.  We end up standing there in the freezing cold for another hour just because saying goodbye is so hard.  I eventually have to just say that if we have anything else to say, hopefully we'll have many more nights to say it.  We then have a very intense hug.  There were times over the past month where I knew she was almost perfect for me on paper, but I wasn't sure how much I viscerally emotionally wanted this.  Durring that hug I knew the spark was there.

I don't know how long things will last.  I don't know what happens now.  I will hope for the best and try what i can to make the best happen.  Here is what I do know.  I'm fat, I'm ugly, I was a lost cause.  [If i can find someone, anyone can.](https://i.imgur.com/W3JS9Gq.jpg) Keep hope alive.

&#x200B;

edit: I just wanted to say thanks for the overwhelming response, including silver.  I've come to this sub for help many times, but sometimes i feel like people lose hope on here.  My wish is that my post will provide some hope for those who are afraid they might be too far gone.  I know that now keeping this relationship together will take work, but at least I now have the chance.  Always keep the hope a lime in your heart."
"""You're perfect. You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""","""You're perfect. You treat me so well, and I am always dying laughing, always looking forward to seeing you, but there is no spark.""

This is a post I just need to make to vent and get some advice here. Sorry for the ramble, I'll try to keep it short. I met this girl through work, she reached out to me because we had a work related phone convo and she felt I was special. We instantly hit it off, talked over text and the phone like crazy all day. We eventually met in person for the first time and had an amazing time. We didn't have sex but I went down on her and honestly gave her one of the most intense O's i've ever seen someone have, not to toot my own horn. But I felt pretty good. We cuddled the rest of the night before I had to go home. We live over an hour apart. All along the while, she makes me laugh and feel great. I honestly thought everything was perfect. I try to be reserved at first but I was getting these ""she may be the one"" feelings even after a week. Maybe the fact she let me eat her out on the first date was a red flag that she was just looking for something more casual.

But this whole time she kept complimenting me, saying how great I was, how she is glad nobody has taken me off the market.. all the things you want to hear from someone who seems like they want a real relationship.

She asked me out on a 2nd date, and well during quarantine there isn't a whole lot to do, so we ended up waiting in line for several hours for some food at a packed drive thru that is always packed and takes hours. She didn't even like the food, but knew I'd never had it before so we went.  We got out of the car and danced together, we sang together, held hands, kissed.. I mean what did I miss here?

Why would someone do all that if they didn't feel anything? -- She starts telling me how she has trust issues and is afraid of being hurt, how she never has had a good relationship and doesn't know how to take care of it, etc... And normally she would just ghost or tell people to fuck off, but she really cares about me. She said she really wanted me to know that she was going through this because she felt I was special.

So I let her have some space while she does that, but she just pulls away.

Wtf mate? I just don't get it. Asked her what was up and we talked on the phone. I asked if there was something I could do to help her through this trust issue and she said it would help if I could tell her how I felt. So I put myself out there and was just honest. Told her I was crazy about her, how I want to keep getting to know her and go out more, how much I enjoy talking with her.  She ends up saying that Everything about me is amazing. That I treat her like a queen, that she is always dying laughing around me, that she always looks forward to hearing from me or seeing me.. But just ""something"" isn't there. Like there is no spark...  But she really feels I am special and cares about me.

So I had to tell her that I just can't really continue like that then and think we shouldnt talk much anymore. She keeps saying she is sorry and we hang up..

I am confused. I know I should just love myself and not care, but everything seemed perfect. I am normally pretty good at spotting my mistakes, or seeing signs they aren't interested.. But she gave so many she was. From all the affection she was giving, to playing love songs in the car while we waited, to touching me, kissing me, grabbing my hand to hold. Was I too nice? I wasn't unconfident, clingy or anything of the like.. Just said sweet things.

I seriously hate dating. I don't know what it is about me that pushes people away, but I am reserved at first and can take a minute to get to know. That doesn't ever seem to create any ""spark"" at all for people and I just am lost. If you suffered through this. Help. I'd be glad to elaborate or answer any questions.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

I just have to say that I truly appreciate all of you. I can't tell you how much healing I feel I've done today simply by having you all respond to me. I will try to respond to everyone, the amount of messages has been overwhelming. I just really need to say that the love has really made my day so much better. I feel much stronger than I did earlier. You all gave me varied insight into what I should be doing. "
"Mortified. But, he handled it like a sport.","So, I’ve been looking forward to a date that happened a few hours ago and I’m typing this wide awake because I’m embarrassed and mortified. I really like this guy and wanted tonight to go over smoothly. But the catch... after we had slept together, as I was getting dressed, there was a towel on the bed that wasn’t there and saw a smudge of red on my pants I was about to put on. I put two and two together and realized I had my period and had ruined his sheets. He was sweet enough to try to conceal the spot under the towel. I had quietly remarked “I think I ruined your sheets” and he said “oh, are there other spots on the bed?” casually and continued to say “don’t worry about it, it’ll wash right out”. I offered to buy him a set of new sheets and he again told me not to worry and jokingly “it adds color to the room”... I mean, I’m still pretty mortified it happened and will probably buy him sheets anyway but he handled it so well. Thankful there are guys out there that know what to do in these situations.

EDIT: Detail

UPDATE: 3rd date on Sunday! Invited to treat him out to my favourite Korean Chicken place in town. Plus, just enough time to let this period make its way out the door lol"
"Quote of the day: ""I'm not an option, I'm an opportunity.""","""... and opportunity only knocks once.""

This is my new motto for dating."
No such thing as too busy to date,"If a person truly wants to go out with you, they'll make the time for you. They wouldn't give you a bunch of crap about being busy, or having other things going on."
This sub is nonstop complaining with little advice on actual dating.,"I thought r/dating would be a place where people talk about how to find people, how to date, date ideas, what to do or what not to do, etc. it seems that most of everything on this sub is just complaining about apps, not being attractive and giving up, or wishing things would go back to the “good old days” without phones. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I would hope there could be change. Are there other subs more similar to what I’m looking for? Thanks."
First date on netflix party lmfao,"alright so i met this beautiful girl on bumble like 3 days ago. we talked all yesterday, then decided to have our first date on netflix party. she’s never seen breaking bad so i told her i’d watch it with her. we’ve been watching it since 11:30 pm, and it’s now 4:30 am. 

she surprisingly had fun and said wants to do this again. she also found it comedic that our first date was on netflix party and so do i, but that’s fine.

we’re in lockdown in cali so we can’t just go and see each other so this will do for now.

edit: i now officially woke up, i responded to a comment earlier and was planning on doing the rest after i completely woken up, but there’s too many now and i’m too lazy to go through them. thanks for the support though lmfao!"
I (26M) met a Hinge date during this lock down and now we're living together for the entire lockdown and it's amazing fun!,"I matched with her last week Saturday and started chatting and switched to Video call in not more than half an hour. We clicked so well that we ended up talking for 8 hours throughout the night and slept at 7am.

We wanted to catch up but the cab services were down (travel history was checked from both ends). Spent the whole day talking on video call when at 1.30 in the night, I just happened to check the cab services and one showed nearby. I sent a request, it got accepted and I was on my way. I was so scared and honestly felt my guts shivering for the fear of being stopped by cops.

Reached her place, she wasn't a serial killer(thank god!) and ended up spending the night and the next night at her place. We then moved to my place on Tuesday and have been here since.

It's so much fun having her around, not to mention the fact that we both like cooking so all the free time goes in cooking something delicious (she's a better cook, hands down!).

I guess I'm one of the few ones who's seriously enjoying this quarantine and hoping that it doesn't end too soon!

If you have a quarantine Valentine, I'm hoping you're having as much fun as I am!

UPDATE: Got a request for an update so here it is. We had our first fight. In the middle of while things were getting hot. For what you ask - because as I pulled her hair (which she likes) she suddenly realised a few of those locks are falling out. Cue mental breakdown and blue balls.

Other than that, we cooked white sauce pasta today, smoked up and got high!"
When someone doesn’t put in effort to keep a convo going by using “lols” or “😂😂😂” or “lmao”. Then just stop wasting my time.,It truly annoys me to see someone constantly being lazy with trying to keep a convo going by using “lol” or “😂😂😂” as a answer to what you said even though it wasn’t even funny but they just don’t care about keeping the convo going and you’re just another person in they’re contact list. It’s truly the most annoying thing in the world like actually talk to me and keep the convo going if you don’t want to talk so be it but stop wasting my time.
"Well, I did it. I have a girlfriend.","I’ve been seeing her for little over 2 weeks, and we’re official as of yesterday.  I have no idea what I did to deserve her. I feel incredibly lucky to be her boyfriend. I must have done something right. 

Thank you to all of you in this subreddit. I couldnt have done it without your advice. I hope you find your one as well."
"[Rant] Why ""being happy being single"" isn't always a good thing.","Sorry in advance for this wall of text, quarantine has just lead me to doing a lot of self-reflection and introspection on things. 

I've spent a lot of time recently reading this subreddit and a few others. The same advice seems to come up quite a bit when people talk about having difficulties getting dates, forming relationships, etc: Work on yourself. Improve yourself. Be happy with yourself single or you won't be happy in a relationship. Be the person you'd want to date. 

Firstly, I'd just like to say that in general this IS very good advice. We should always be looking to improve ourselves as people. Not necessarily just for the sake of dating/meeting a partner, but just to make our lives better as a whole. 

But there's something else I'd like to address here. 

There seems to be a prevailing attitude in quite a few dating advice forums that essentially boils down to ""be okay with being single"". At face value this seems like a good approach; if you're not happy being on your own, why drag another person down with you? But I'd like to make a potential counter-argument to this, or at least partly.

There seems to be two possible perspectives here:

1) Be happy with yourself as a person, while you just so happen to be single.

2) Be happy being single, as a status or condition of your life.

The first one is, in my opinion, very solid advice. And in general I'd say that in most areas of my life I am very happy with how things are going. I've got a stable job, solid group of friends, in good shape, do things that make me happy and improve myself as a person, you get the idea. 

However, the second one can be...dangerous, to put it one way.

I'm a 27 year old guy, and have never had a girlfriend in my life. Never had sex, never kissed anyone, blah blah you've heard this story before. When I was younger it wasn't that big of a deal, really. There was so much other stuff happening in life that dating and relationships were pretty much on the back burner. But going into college, and after graduating, I started realizing something might be wrong. All my friends and peers were in dedicated long-term relationships, or were at least having success when it came to casual dating. I was the odd man out. So I decided to make some changes and did my research. That lead to a commitment to self-improvement, which I'm still pursuing to this day. At first things seemed to be looking up; my confidence improved, I felt much better about myself as a person, and generally had a better outlook on life.

But the one area that remained the same was my romantic/dating life, or lack thereof. I felt good about myself as a person who just so happened to be single. However, I still wasn't happy with BEING single. 

My friends tried to help, and a lot of them took the approach of telling me how great being single is. Not having to worry about arguments/relationship troubles/etc. But to me that always felt like a bit of a cop-out answer. Imagine telling someone who was dying of thirst ""Oh, water? Yeah it's okay I guess, but it's not *that* great."" 

That lack of dating success started bleeding into other areas of my life. What confidence I'd built up pretty much vanished after I was rejected a number of times, and still hasn't come back. It also feels like I'm the verge of having depressive episodes almost every day. I tried to think of other areas that needed to be improved, that could possibly be leading to this back-track in the progress I'd made. But it always came back to my perpetual state of being alone. 

It feels like a constant feedback loop. I can't seem to make any progress when it comes to dating, which means that there must be something wrong with me. There's something wrong with me, which means I won't have any success trying to date/form relationships. This also contributes to a concern that at this point it's too late for me, that nobody will want to go out with a 27 year old who's never had a girlfriend in his life. From an outside perspective, it's easy to see how someone might think there's some serious underlying issues there that would explain this lack of experience.

What I'm trying to say (in an admittedly very verbose way) is this: The advice of ""be happy being single"" isn't always great, at least in the long term. While I like myself as a person who's single, the idea of being alone for the rest of my life is terrifying and feeds back into some of the negative self-talk that has sprouted from a lack of romantic experiences. I don't want to be single; I want to be able to form healthy relationships like everyone else, to have that intimacy and trust with another person but have never been able to experience so far. It feels like I've been missing out on one of the most rewarding things life has to offer, and everyone says ""oh, just be okay with it!""."
Stop👏joining👏dating👏sites👏if👏you👏don't👏intend👏to👏date!,"The last 3 people I've talked to all intended to meet up for a date. We would talk for about a month or so to get to know each other and then plan a day to meet up. A couple days before or the day of they decide to change plans or leave me by myself and give me some BS excuse or ghost on me all together.

This one person I've been talking to for almost 3 months keeps coming up with excuses and now out of nowhere she just ghosted me for about a week and apologized to me saying she didn't mean to ghost if that's how I felt and now she's doing it again. 

If you don't like someone, just tell them and don't leave them wondering what the hell happened"
I just want to find a decent man...,"Someone who actually gives a shit. They care about you as much as you care about them. They aren’t afraid of being public with you, they don’t look at every other girl and make comments about their bodies. They don’t take complete advantage of you. They don’t call you whipped if you do something nice like make breakfast. It’s not all about sex, you have nights where you just talk for hours and hours. Were I don’t feel used. I’m not made to feel like a dumb ass when I have feelings. Someone who supports me, who talks me through bad times. I want to be treated how I treat them. I hate one sided relationships. Someone who just loves me and will say it, not once a month when I’m not in the mood to have sex and they use that as their tactic so you let your guard down. I know they exist, I just don’t know how to find someone like that. It feels like something just in books or for other people. Gorgeous people, who have great jobs, a big house and nice cars. Not all around average... 

I settle for the assholes because that’s the kind of men I grew up around. My uncles, dad who left when I was a week old, everyone. That’s what I think I deserve. Hell, if a guy acted the way I hope for one day- I’d be scared I’d run for the hills because I’d think they had ulterior motives. I fucking hate it. Is there anyone that’s had a really awful dating history and found their soulmate out there? To give me a little hope?


Edit: okay, I (24F) didn’t expect this to blow up like this at all, holy shit. Umm, I’ll give more background? So a skimmed comments because there’s... a lot... lol. And a lot are saying therapy, I did go to therapy but it was for my childhood trauma and the experience wasn’t my favorite so I left. Now, I saw one person talk about abandonment issues, I do have those but I don’t really have a fear of being left behind. I’ve never had someone that I’ve noticed make an impact after leaving, well maybe my dad but I’d rather be with my mom (as much of a “mom” as she is) than an alcoholic drug addict around me as an example to look up to. I just don’t know what a good relationship looks like is my problem. I’ve only been in two relationships, one I was left at a bar in the worst part of downtown because the “really nice guy” flipped out all of the sudden claiming I was getting him drunk (he bought a bottle of vodka, I drank a cup of rum and coke- I’m not a big drinker and he was, that’s not my fault). Now the one I’m one foot in one foot out is the one that’s really messed me up for good. I tried leaving when I noticed he was changing, after becoming this person he molded himself into so I would fall for him because he was “what I was looking for”, but this guy. This is not someone that you can run from. He buys new phone numbers, gets new social media accounts, puts numbers under different numbers- I mean you can only imagine what someone going to school for cybersecurity can do. Anyways, after two attempts to get away from him he took it as a chance to trap me. Now, with my mental health issues (major chronic depression, anxiety and panic disorder, etc etc the fun list goes on) cause me to be safer to not be on birth control. So, I don’t take it- and that’s a very very well known fact I make clear if they show interest. Well, after being together for two and a half months he got tired of me trying to leave and “getting mad at him.” Now I’m stuck with him in some way for 18 years and 5 months. Now it’s not only manipulation to get me back, now it’s him threatening lawyers, to take my baby, etc etc etc because that I can’t run from. He’s an awful human being and I just don’t know how I can put myself in the dating world once I get both feet out after him... so yeah, I didn’t put my history on here because when I do have my posts about him men say awful things to me and are on his side so I wanted this one to be vague. I have my moments I just break and yesterday wasn’t a good day for me..."
Seriously put SOMETHING in your description on dating apps!,"Just your face is not enough. Does that face have a brain? Why not put a single sentence in your profile? Does it really work for you to leave it blank? I can’t help but assume you’re the most self-obsessed person ever.

How am I supposed to broach a conversation from nothing?

It’s an automatic swipe left from me if I see a blank profile no matter how “hot” you think you are."
I hate hate hate hate hate seeing couples on dating apps,There should be (if there's not one already) a dating app for couples looking for a 3rd or individuals looking to join couples. Im an individual looking for a monogamous relationship/casual dating and im sick of seeing nothing but couples. Its hard enough for me to find one person who wants to spend time with me
Anybody other dudes not interested in casual sex?,"I'm not a needy guy, I'm not in a rush to get into a relationship. But I have no interest in having flings with women, you're either a friend or a potential girlfriend. If its not genuine then I'd rather have blue balls. I've prevented many sexual encounters because I just dont find it deep enough. 



Seems like I'm in the minority for guys"
So I met this girl . . .,"Three weeks ago I matched with this girl on Tinder. We both played PC games so we started talking about that. As we chatted we found out we had some mutual friends. We had started chatting in the evening so she had to go to bed. But she messaged me again in the morning. We’ve been talking every day since.

We text in the morning and throughout the day and play video games, watch Haunting of Hill House on Netflix, and chat in the evenings. We spend hours video chatting every day often late into the evenings. I’ve never met someone who is such a perfect match.

We have the same beliefs and values, we both value communication and discussion, and we both find each other really considerate and caring. But we also have so much in common! We have similar food tastes, enjoy each other’s taste in music, both enjoy PC gaming, and cuddles and both of our favorite stores are the dollar store. The most interesting thing is we both share the exact same birthday just 3 years apart (24M) (21F).

We’ve been really open with each other and we’ve been feeling the exact same way about each other. We are each others type and find the other very attractive. Both of us have been feeling like everything has been going really well and we make the other one happy.

We haven’t seen each other in person yet but we plan on seeing each other on Friday for the first time. We’re both really excited! I think I found the girl of my dreams.

You win some you lose some,"I finally cut things off with a girl I’ve been talking to. For the time it was great, she was funny, smart and we had similar interests. But there were noticeable red flags that popped up along the way. Those including; constantly talking about their ex, saying they were hard to handle and crazy, admitting they were clingy, inconsistent communication etc. Cutting this off was hard, emotionally I really liked her and saw myself hanging out with her after quarantine. But when I took a step back and evaluated the situation, I knew that the relationship wouldn’t work out. This is the first time I’ve done this, I feel like it’s an important step forward to future dating success."

"Is it just me or are 80% of dating profiles these days some variation of ""love food, traveling and netflix""?","Since when are things like eating food hobbies?

Just got kissed for the first time in eight years (30M),"Wow.

So earlier this week I met up with someone my age from an online dating website. We walked around town, had dinner and a few drinks together. It seemed to be going well, and she’s really amazing and beautiful, but being the skinny, insecure nerd that I am (never been in a relationship, never had sex) I had no idea if she liked me romantically or not.

In a random burst of confidence which happens very rarely to me, as we were laughing and talking together near the end of the evening, I out of the blue asked if I could kiss her. She said yes. Before I could process this, she moved up close to me and we made out for a good few minutes.

She was the first person to kiss me since the beginning of 2011, when I was 22. I’m now 30. No one I had met in the last eight years had made the move on me, and everyone I had asked (which might sound lame to some but I’ve always been cautious) had all gently said no. I started online dating a year and a half ago when I had enough of being alone, but I hadn’t had much success until now. I didn’t tell her how long it had been, I just said after she was the first in a long time. To which she smiled, understood, and kissed me even more.

I feel pretty incredible about it still. We both lead busy lives but I hope we find time soon to see each other again. And, whatever happens, I *really* hope it’s not another eight years until the next time.

What’s the next step for me, and how can I keep this new-found confidence/self-worth going?"
"Pro tip: If you're horny and want to text your ex, masturbate first, and then reassess how you feel!","I just broke up with someone I was seeing for a whirlwind 2.5 weeks. She messaged me that she misses me, and I really wanted to tell her to come over. Instead, I masturbated and then thought long and hard about what I wanted. And I don't want her.

I mean, she's great, but not right for me, and if I had told her to come over I know I would have gotten sucked by into being with her. (This was a difficult decision, because I really liked her despite the multiple things that lead me to realize we aren't compatible long term, and I chose to end it before it ended due to the incompatibilities.)"
So that’s depressing about your dog dying hey? 🙂,"I went on a date with my secret jr.high crush last week, we matched on tinder and then finally got to get together when some restaurants opened up again! 

then I proceeded to: 

-aggressively bring up the recent death of his dog 

-unintentionally call his Mother stupid
 
-awkwardly only eat 3 plain chips from a whole plate of guacamole & chips, out of sheer nervousness 

-rounded it off by confessing that i’ve joined the military and could get kicked over to basic training when life returns to normal 

- also a plethora of random other things that quickly brought on awkward moments 

LOL then I called him after he dropped me off at my car & told him I was really sorry and not actually that weird and awkward, but that I was just really
nervous because I’d had an old crush on him- he laughed and assured me it was all good. 

aaaaaaaaand we have not talked since LOL"
Why you should have low expectations,"M26 am sitting in a coffee shop where I was supposed to meet F20. I stayed out wayyy too late and with the time change I only got 4 hours of sleep and am pretty hungover to be honest. Yet I still made it on time and cleaned up well. She didn't show...

She had some stuff come up and woke up late etc. She did apologize, but is making no effort to reschedule or make up for it. 

My point is that I kinda quit caring lol. I've been at the dating game for so long that I'm pretty carefree about it. Now I'm just chilling out sipping coffee while on reddit curing my hangover lol.

Tl;dr Got stood up so I'm treating myself to a nice date. This is why you have low expectations!

Edit: I did try to confirm the date 1 hour before, I had planned on going to the coffee shop regardless."
Absence makes the heart grow fonder,"... it shouldn’t leave you guessing and worried.

What I’m saying is that I see so many posts from people who are so damn unsure and worried about the person they’re dating. They make themselves crazy because they’re trying to decipher what the other person is thinking or feeling and worried whether or not they’re into them.

But dating shouldn’t be like that. You should be sure about what you and the other person want.

And to be honest I used to think that being unsure and self conscious was just part of the game and I’d be so self conscious about every text I’d send, every word I’d say, every action I’d take.

But the truth is that if you find someone who gets you and wants to be with you, you won’t have to bend and break to know where you stand with them. I know this isn’t some sort of groundbreaking epiphany I’m sharing but I want to share it nonetheless.

Dating should be fun. You shouldn’t have to overthink every step you take. And simply put you should be able to be yourself and not question every little thing you do or say.

Because in the end... if the person you’re dating leaves you guessing and worrying when you’re not actively with them... you should move on from them. 

A person who wants to be with and cares about you will let you know and let you feel it. They’ll build you up and give you the attention you deserve. They’ll answer your texts in a timely manner, they’ll take you out to dates, they’ll make time for you even when they’re busy, they’ll build you up when you’re down...

They won’t leave you on read for hours, they won’t flake on you, they won’t be unsure about you, they won’t make you question their intentions. 

Basically I feel as if we should all listen to ourselves and our own feelings more. How that person makes you feel when you’re not around them will tell you so much more about how good they are for you than when you’re with them. 

It’s not even what *they’re are doing but so much more what you yourself are feeling*. 

If a person manages to put a smile on your face even though you haven’t seen them for a few days... that’s where it’s at. If they manage to make you feel down and question your own self worth in that time... do yourself a favor and move on. 

They’re absence shouldn’t bring you anything but a bit of quality time for yourself."
Anyone else lonely at this lockdown time? COVID-19,"Been single for a few months. I wanted this year to be my year of dating and meeting new people. I was off to a decent start but then COVID happened. The relationships I built prior seem to he dying a bit. There is only so much you can text a person without seeing them.


All this makes me miss my ex even more."
Does anyone else feel jinxed when it comes to relationships?,"People I’m not interested in, get friggin obsessed and text / call / FaceTime me a million times in a row, 

Meanwhile The second I become interested in someone they completely stop answering or disappear

Anyone else feel like this?

Edit: wow I did not expect this to blow up so much! Thanks for all your responses, Reddit! I’m glad we can all share this ridiculousness in common"
Just remember: it isn’t fair to compare your connection with someone you met recently to someone you know very well,"When I think about meeting new people and they seem boring, I realize I am comparing all the best parts of my former relationship. How can someone I just met, who I barely know or am just getting to know, compare to someone I built a former deep and meaningful relationship with? 

It’s not realistic to expect that right off the bat. It’s easy to hold your ex to a high standard and feel as though no one else will hold up to them, but it’s unrealistic to compare a connection that formed over time and a connection just beginning to develop. I felt like they knew me better than anyone else. That came from spending a LOT of time together. I can’t expect to feel seen and known from people who Ive barely given the chance to get to know me. Comparing, and looking for that instant connection, is not always representative of what your relationship could be. 

I have to constantly keep reminding myself of this. You’ll meet someone else who blows that person out of the water. Very rarely is a real connection formed so instantly. Give people a chance—chemistry can be formed. Don’t compare the best parts of your past to how things are going now. It’s not fair to the other person to have to try and live up to an impossible standard right off the bat. I know this is something I have to work on. Hopefully it’s something that helps you too."
Let's stop with the victim mentality in dating,"I have been going on way more dates as a 25 Y/O woman and I've gained way more lessons and experiences in the last year than I did in all the 7 years before when I started dating guys. Something I've realized is that there seems to be a normalized victim mentality when it comes to dating and I think we need to collectively challenge  this. On this sub I see lots of posts about ""I hate being dragged along"" ""If you don't like me romantically LET ME KNOW so I can move on"" etc and all these posts basically enforce the idea that the power always has to lie in your romantic interest and not in you. Well I realized something recently: Our sole responsibility as individuals is to take care of ourselves and be happy period. It's not to figure out why our partner is withdrawing from us especially if they won't communicate like adults, whether they're interested, whether they're not. In dating situations I've found myself asking more about How they make me feel and whether I like it instead of whether I'm good enough for them and it's been life changing. When I was younger I would pine and wonder about a guy's interest now I only go for guys who are full on after me If I have to guess I'm out. I approach my life in general with an abundance mentality and I've noticed I'm getting more positive male attention this way. I always make it clear what I want and how I want to be treated. If I notice things are changing I ask about it once. After that I dip tf out and move on to the next or stay single, they can explain when they want but I'm out at that point. Don't accept long response times, late night only convos, disrespect, lack of clarity, feeling led on. This is the only soul and body you'll ever have. Why are you allowing anyone to do you the disservice of guessing and pining because they are not brave enough to let you go and are choosing to ghost? Take your power back, let yourself go.

EDIT: This post is not encouraging ""selfishness"" or ""callousness"". It's about integrity and self respect. If you know what's makes you happy then that's is what you should go after. I'm not saying ""Walk away from anything as soon as a little problem arises"". I'm saying notice it, communicate with your partner and both of you meet each other in a good middle. If they cannot work with you then with self respect, walk away. 

TL/DR: If a situation is not enriching you, bounce without pining for closure from the outside."
Never having been in a relationship during my teens and 20s will haunt me for the rest of my life I think if I’m honest. Just need to get to where it doesn’t hurt do much.,"I’m in my 30s now and it’s flying by faster than my 20s (which felt like they were over in a few months or something). I keep trying to reframe things and tell myself that it’s fine that I never was in a relationship during this time. But it’s a lie. I’ll always care that this didn’t happen to me. I’ll always feel like I missed out on something special. A period of time that most people find to be their best years of life. I just missed out on them. So it basically ruined my life in a way. And for the rest of my life I’m doomed to live with the fact that I’m running behind everyone in this central part of life. So it kind of is a big deal. I try to dismiss it because when I finally had sex I didn’t like it. Well, I missed out on it. It’s already gone. Being a coward when I was younger fucked me over completely."
Is there anyone who still hopes to grow old with someone?,"Recently, I’ve been seeing more and more posts about the pressures of staying in a monogamic relationship and how we all should just love and accept that love may end someday. But I have trouble reconciling with this thought because I truly want to grow old with someone and just one person alone. I don’t want multiple loves. I want at least one real thing. And if I find that one real thing, I want to do the best I can to cultivate, nourish, and keep that relationship alive. 

Am I the only who feels this way? Just wanted to see if there are still people who are looking for the same thing as I am.


EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect this to blow up, but it’s so great to see that I’m not alone in this. It’s encouraging to see that there are still a lot of us who want this out there. Hoping for the best for all of us!"
"Plenty of Fish is the biggest, shittiest waste of money I have ever spent on a dating app.","Which is saying something, since it's the ONLY one I've spent money on. First off, the site/app/clusterfuck is filled to the brim with ""robot"" scam accounts that tdy to get your card and phone number to take your money, but they are disguised as a woman who likes you. Unfortunately, tbe only way to find this out is to pay for a POF subscription to even SEE who it was that liked you. Then they have something called LIVE! ...Don't even get me started on LIVE!.. it is filled with massive amounts of stoners, smokers, alchoholics, drug addicts, you name it. The most ""normal"" it ever gets is running across a guy wearing a baseball cap and a hoodie (Like any good stereotype) or a girl chilling in her room at night just to talk and not get attention. But, for the most part, it is a shitstorm of a popularity contest with a tornado of random animations flying across the screen and covering up your keyboard to keep you from typing whilst you watch two people on cam ""date"" to earn a virtual and meaningless ""diamond"" currency that does jack shit but show off your e-peen/e-gina. I tried emailing customer support for my money back and they told me all sales are final. 

Fuck Plenty of Fish and fuck online dating services. They're as bad as I judged them to be before I ever even decided to give one a chance. Never again am I spending money on this bullshit. I probably missed some details but I'm so angry right now I don't give a fuck."
So a guy buys you a drink....,"So I am a female, sitting at a bar all alone, enjoying my afternoon. The guy from across the bar buys me a drink. The bartender brought it over. I look back to say thanks. The guy is actively looking the other way. He never comes over to talk to me. I finally see him go to the bathroom. So I walk over and ask his friend. ""So is he ever going to come say hello.” He tells me he will mention it to him. So he comes out, and I can hear him in the background say, ""Why do I have to go talk to her.” Long story short he finally does. So Reddit, what is the receptors cue when one buys a drink?"
Shrek storytime,"Shrek at bedtime

So my girlfriend struggles with sleeping, especially now that Covid-19 is about and we are actually in isolation.
So last night she asked me to tell her a bedtime story to help her sleep.
I was feeling super tired and considered just saying no, but I decided that if it was for her I could do my best.
So what better story than Shrek? 
My storytelling skills are by no means legendary, but it made me really happy when, after talking in my Shrek accent, she burst out laughing, told me she was falling asleep now but couldn’t help but laugh at my impression, and hugged me until she fell asleep.
Super wholesome and I didn’t know who else to share it with."
"If he or she doesn't call or text you back, then do not pursue because you'll only make yourself look like you're chasing after them. He or she has already shown their lack of interest, so show him or her your pride! You are TOO GOOD to kiss someone's ass just to be with them or for sex.","People have access to many other people these days, and many of them tend to be rather fickle, arrogant, overly selective and full of games. There is no such thing as ""playing hard to get"" anymore. People simply don't give a shit, and the more genuine and real you are; the nicer you try to be and the more interest you display, you run the actual risk of encountering people who believe it's OK to take you for granted; leave your ass hanging... and some of them even have the nerve to call you weeks or months later as if nothing ever happened as if you're going to be standing by with the same crush or desperation and waiting on their ass. This is not to say or imply that you should become ONE of these people. NO! Don't do that... because if you let this happen, then all you will do is decrease or diminish the quality of your OWN character. All I'm saying is you must REFUSE to chase after people who mislead, play games, never call/text or return calls and texts or disrespect you no matter HOW good they look or WHAT they can do in bed! These kind of people will use their looks, sexual abilities and the size of whatever is in their underwear or bra to use, take advantage or hurt others... and none of these things are worth you pride and self-respect. Ya feel me? If a person is ugly on the inside... then they are ugly as hell on the inside. What's even more crazy is the fact that the games have gotten so bad that even the not-so-good-looking people think they can treat people this way. LMAO

So let's run through this one more time... if he or she doesn't call or text you back, then do not pursue because you'll only make yourself look like you're chasing after them. He or she has already shown their lack of interest, so show him or her your pride! You are TOO GOOD to kiss someone's ass just to be with them or for sex."
"A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn’t Interested","When a girl says that she's too busy to hang out with you, have you ever wondered whether she's uninterested in you or actually busy that week with psets and exams? Based on extensive research, interviews with my fellow female friends, and personal experience (I'm a girl), I have determined a 100% foolproof way to tell. Ready to hear the secret? Here it is: she is interested but actually busy IF AND ONLY IF she tells you that she's busy *but suggests an alternate day to hang out with you*. Otherwise, if she just leaves her response as a simple ""Sorry, I'm busy"" without a follow-up, she's not interested!

Even worse is when she gives you the second response but you then ask her, ""So when are you free?"" This puts her in an extremely uncomfortable situation because it doesn't give her the option to decline unless she says something like ""Oh sorry, I'm never free,"" which she obviously would want to avoid because it's impolite. So then she panics and says, “uhh, I’m not sure,” to avoid explicitly telling you that she doesn’t want to hang out with you, ever. And you are bewildered by her response and think that women are confusing.

To summarize, here is A Handy Guide on How to Ask a Girl Out, Yet Save Face for Both of You If She Isn’t Interested:

Ask the girl the following: “Hey, I was wondering if you’d be free this ______ at ___ pm to get dinner with me?” Be extremely specific! Don’t say, “Are you free in the next decade?” or worse yet, “When are you free?”. It’s much better to say, “Are you free this Saturday at 6:30pm?”.

Option A: She says some variation of “yes”. Wow, that was easy!

Option B: She says, “Sorry, I have five psets and two exams that week, but how about _____? Does that work for you?” Congratulations, she was actually busy but is interested in you! You also gave her the option to decide on a date that works for her, you gentleman you!

Option C: She says, “I’m a bit busy then. Sorry, I don’t think I’ll be able to make it.” Oof, sorry my dude, she wasn’t into you. Do not, under any circumstances, suggest another day. This is because if she was truly interested, SHE’D suggest another date. Wish her the best with her work and go your separate ways.

For everyone out there who’s afraid of rejection (ie, everyone), this is the perfect method, because by suggesting a very specific date and time, there’s a huge chance that she will actually be busy. This means that her response of, “Sorry, I’m busy” will be genuine, but now it gives HER the power to decide on a further course of action. Essentially, you’ve turned the tables and now *she’s* the one asking *you* out! Thus, if she suggests another time, congratulations, a girl just asked you out on a date! If she doesn’t, that’s equivalent to her never having asked you out in the first place, so everything has stayed the same and you have lost nothing.

I hope this helped, and good luck!"
Insight: When someone says they don’t want a relationship or a relationship “right now” it really means a relationship with you,"EDIT 2 and DISCLAIMER: Yes, this doesn’t apply 100% of the times. Just like with every other general advice take it with a grain of salt and assess how it works in your situation.

*****
ORIGINAL POST:

Take it from someone doing it right now. If you are dating and meeting new people you may get with someone whom you click with either sexually or have fun BUT not  necessarily want a relationship with.  

Not wanting a relationship “right now” only really means “not with you”. 

Yes there are occasions where this isn’t true and the person doesn’t want to be in a relationship period, but most of the times it means they are waiting for someone else (sometimes someone they haven’t met but an archetype different than you). 

The best you can do is not waste your time and move on or accept it will go nowhere and enjoy it.

As for me I am pretty open towards the beginning what type of relationship I see myself having with the other person so there are no confusions.

EDIT: To the dozen people saying “not always”: It’s right there in the third paragraph. I already said is not always the case but in general terms this applies."
Girl I’ve been messaging on tinder just asked to change our date tonight to attending a BLM rally,"Just sharing a cool experience. I’ve been planning to go climbing with this girl for about a week. She seems pretty cool and I was moderately excited (about as excited as I generally get for a tinder date with a girl I haven’t met yet). Then she asked if we could go to the rally instead, and now I’m actually stoked! 

I’ve been on a lot of dates with girls who didn’t seem passionate about anything. This is an exciting change!

Edit: I’m definitely going. I’d planned to swing by before climbing tonight anyway, but this is a unique and exciting opportunity.

Edit edit: appreciate all the safety advice, but we live in a small mountain town far from bigger cities so I’m not worried about the event getting out of hand. In any case, the rally is actually taking place in a park two blocks from my house.

Final edit: it was good! The rally was peaceful and the only unsavory characters were a handful of white supremacists with guns (and individually more or less chins than average) who tried to intimidate marchers from a street corner. We’re going climbing next week."
"""You choose who you want to be with"" - Dating advice from my therapist","I started going to therapy recently and the subject of dating is a usual topic. I just wanted to share what she said because it made me think. Here's what happened.

So I asked her ""How do you meet people nowadays?"" she chuckled a bit and said ""I get that question a lot. Some people are great. They're intelligent, educated, good personality but they just have a hard time meeting people due to the nature of society nowadays (work first over personal life).""

I told her about my exes and 'my perfect boyfriend', I asked her if it was too much to ask for someone like that. She said ""Well, I'm not saying it's impossible but it'll be difficult."" then I said ""Okay, well I think I need to put myself out there more. Put myself in a position to meet this person.""

This is the part that hit me. She responded ""That's no guarantee either. You could go on a dating app and date 10 guys but none of them will be the one. You could go to classes and hobby groups but the chances of meeting someone is like 50/50. Even if you do meet someone you like, there's no guarantee they'll like you back. You can't control them.""

And then her advice was to just focus on things you can control, which is working on yourself.  When I started talking about ""the one"" or ""the one I'll be compatible with"" she was kinda shaking her head and she said ""We just choose who we end up with... so do you want the funny guy who isn't handsome? The handsome guy but is boring? Etc...""

I think what she was trying to say is that no one is going to be perfect and if we hold out for that person it'll be difficult and beyond our control. We're all just imperfect humans and we just choose which other imperfect human to be with.

So from this I'm somewhat changing my mindset about dating.

Anyway, would love to hear your thoughts on my therapists advice!"
Guys. Are you being breadcrumbed?!,"If she's flirting with you, getting close to you, purposefully putting herself in your orbit.  Then ask her out on a date.  The only acceptable answers are yes or no.  Anything else (I'll let you know, maybe next week, don't you have work tomorrow?) then treat it as a ""No thanks.  Not interested."". Keep it professional and move on.

If she comes back and repeats the flirting, getting close, putting herself in your orbit, ask her out again.  If she says everything but yes, then my friend, you are just around for attention (i.e - being bread-crumbed).  From here just draw the line in the sand and keep it at hi and bye.  That's it. Take back your power.  99% sure she'll come around ""Oh what's wrong?"" ""You're acting so weird."".  Do not.  I repeat. Don't fall for it!  She knows exactly what's going on and  she's looking for a defensive retort to show she can still get attention from you.  Just tell her straight up, ""We're cool.  I'll catch you around.""  That's it.  These are the type of women that want 0 to do with you romantically, but if you get a girlfriend, here come all the ""Hey.  How have you been?""  ""We should catch up,"" calls/texts.  These type of women are nothing more than attention whores. Sure she'll keep you around to complain about other men, but you're not getting anywhere sexual with this girl.  Just keep it moving. **Edit :** You are deemed ***persona non grata*** ***in braca*** by this girl.

There's a reason why she is single.  And you have just witnessed firsthand.   Congratulations.  You have just saved yourself months/days/weeks of frustration."
This guy I was seeing told me he doesn't do relationships or intimacy but that we should keep seeing each other,"So I said ""PEACE.""

I've honestly heard this so many times in the past three/four years. These dudes want all the benefits of a relationship without any commitment or putting work in. 

I'm tired of compromising my own needs and desires because someone else likes the attention/sex/company. 

It's the first time I haven't just reluctantly entered a situation I didn't wanna be in where I knowingly end up getting hurt just because I want to try to make things work. I'm actually so proud of myself for having the self-respect to dip from that before I got even more invested. It was a really really hard decision to make.

Here's hoping I'll stick with it."
Proud of myself.,"I miss having someone to call just to tell them about the $5 bill I just found in my pocket. Someone to kill that spider in the bathroom. Someone to cuddle and share the silence with. Someone who races over when I don’t feel well to take care of me. But I don’t miss him. I miss having someone. 

I’m proud of myself on days like today where I really want to reach out to him and tell him I miss him. But I’m not letting my mind play tricks on me. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. The past is the past and he should stay there.

Stay strong to anyone out there feeling the same ❤️"
Feeling good I stood up for myself,"So I matched with this girl on tinder and she seems attractive and nice. She goes to my university and we both want to go into the medical field. We talk for a week and it turns out were actually from the same background and lots of other similar interests. We make plans to grab drinks when things are safe again. She then asks me how tall I am and I tell her I'm 5' 8''. She hits me with the ""....ya loooool that's a dealbreaker for me"" because shes a little shorter than that in heels. I roll my eyes and tell myself I just wasted a week when I could've been studying. I've dated before and I realized that trying to date someone when you aren't their type is just gonna be a mess anyway so I wish her the best of luck with school and work. She replies to me anyways saying that we should keep talking bc height isn't THAT big of a dealbreaker. But I tell her I'm good anyway and that we should just go our own way.

I've dated in the past and I've come to realize that I'm not going to be a  perfect match for everyone, and that being single is ok. I also don't want to date someone wondering if I'm ""good enough for her"" the entire time.  I've done that before and it makes me toxic and insecure.

Ya, just wanted to get this off my chest. It feels bittersweet. I realize that I'm smart, fit, hardworking, good looking, albeit average height guy. Someone out there is right for me. But until then, back to studying!"
People are WAY too obsessed with getting texts back immediately,"I feel like almost every question on here is some form of ""They don't text everyday, are they not interested?"" ""I haven't gotten a message in 2 days, am I being ghosted?"" or ""They haven't texted me back yet, what does it mean?""  


I feel like this sub in general is supportive and gives good insight, but am I the only person who doesn't need to text everyday with someone I just met/started seeing? I often see posts of people freaking out over 2 or 3 days of not talking. Most of the time I don't think this is a big deal. I feel like people forget that others have lives outside of their dating lives.


EDIT: 

The general consensus seems to be that it really depends on the context. And yeah, I agree. But I feel like I’ve seen a lot of posts on this sub where OP is concerned/paranoid simply because of breaks greater than a day in between texting when otherwise the person seemed interested and everything else was fine.

I also want to emphasize that my post isn’t directed at people in serious relationships. (A few comments talked about how they would text their SO everyday and I definitely understand that.)"
"Man, I really miss being in love.","Cuffing season’s just around the corner and it’s probably going to be another Christmas as single. 

I’m tired. Tired of talking, tired of wasting energy, tired of fake ass people, tired of getting excited for an extremely short period of time, tired of meaningless hookups that make me feel even more lonely afterwards, tired of being seen as just an object, just very tired of being alone and not having someone who’s genuinely interested.

Edit: this post didn’t explode or anything but it did get a lot more attention than I thought it would because it was just a spur of the moment rant thing. Just wanted to thank everyone for their kind words, stories and making me (27F) feel less alone about this. Really warms my heart :)"
Dating is easy,"Dating shouldn't be hard. Its a built in buddy system. Hold hands with your buddy so you don't get separated. Check in on your buddy. Be a good buddy. 

Yeah, arguments and problems happen. They shouldn't be the majority of the relationship. Trust me. No matter how much you love a person, no matter what you would do for a person, if it's not working its not working. 

If your buddy doesn't check on you? It's not healthy. 
If your buddy doesn't care about you? Nope!
If your buddy hurts you? Get outta there buckaroono!
If your buddy is confused if they still want to be buddies? They should know if they want to work it out, and if they are ""unsure"" LEAVE!!

Nothing hurts more than getting out of a relationship and realizing how bad you were treated because they were a bad buddy. 

Tell your trusted friends everything. See their response. All the red flags just look like flags when you're wearing rose colored glasses. You can't trust yourself sometimes."
"A dating app based on get to know you questions, where photos get progressively less blurry with each question you answer","I noticed pretty much all dating apps are swipeing based after looking at a photo or two.

Would there be any interest in an app based on a specific set of get to know you questions, where photos get progressively less blurry with each question you answer. Ofcourse, if both parties agree to show their photo before they get through the questions they can do so."
Stop asking for nudes!!!,"I don't know if this is just the name of the game, but does anyone else always have the problem of people constantly asking you for nudes on the dating apps? So this is across Tinder and Bumble. It would start off as a normal conversation, getting to know each other, and then out of the blue, they would ask for a nude. 

I guess I don't understand why they would think that would be appropriate to ask or maybe they've done it in the past and people have said yes? Personally, I am just shocked someone would ask that and it just makes me think they were only talking to me to get to that point. They were only talking to me in hopes I would send them a nude. Part of me wants to ask them why they think it's okay to ask that, but I typically will just unmatch and not engage. 

I guess with dating apps, it is the luck of the draw but it is still unsettling, to me, whenever I get asked to send someone a nude."
How do I avoid over investing in people too quickly,"I tend to put a lot of investment in a relationship. Like it becomes the focus of my life. I also don't take rejection very well if someone breaks up with me. Also... I tend to get very clingy and needy.

Is it a lot to want to see a gf everyday?

Idk why I get so crazy in relationships man. I have a really hard time taking care of myself, becoming too dependent on the other person for comfort, love, emotional, physical and sexual fulfillment.

Idk man."

Option: I’ll let you know if I have time. Priority: I’ll make time.,"I’ve been casually dating for a few months now and taking a slow approach to it. I know people are busy between jobs, parenting, hobbies and everyday life. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t put ANY
 effort into dating if it’s a priority to you. Sometimes it’s the little things that count! 

For example, connected with one guy via OLD and a month had gone by and still no date. He was always “busy” at work, with his kid, but would be snap chatting him by the pool or out and about lol. Final straw was when we had a date set up (finally) I ask for a time around 10 a.m and his response was “I’ll let you know, I’m school shopping for my kid”. I get a text at 8:30 pm asking if I’m ready. No thanks. 

Fast forward to the guy I’m seeing now. Also very busy, works 12 hour shifts and coparents but we have had two dates within three weeks, we talk on the phone a few times a week, text sporadically through the day. When he has his kid I don’t blow his phone up, and vice versa (I coparent as well). The big difference is we prioritize that time. He sometimes falls asleep on the phone and I think it’s adorable. Last night, before telling me goodnight he apologized for the nights he falls asleep without telling me. *insert big cheesy smile*. Third date is a late dinner which I don’t usually do but I’m compromising due to him getting off work late. (Priority)

The moral of the story is, if someone is a priority to you, make time for them. No one likes to feel like they are simply an option. The End."
Sometimes the most intimate moments are simply not captured.,"Hey guys, I know we live in a world that pays a lot of attention to social media. And I myself have fallen into the horrible spiral of comparing my relationship to some of the ones I see on social media. Seeing boyfriends post their girlfriends and publicly gush about them always made me feel warm and fuzzy inside, but I’ve come to realize and fully accept that 1. not everything on social media is real 2. some of those couples mostly just post for the hype, and have problems we never see as “outsiders” 3. Some men/women express their love in different ways

Of course, these are things we’ve all heard before. Everyone will tell you “social media doesn’t matter” but sometimes we can’t help our feelings. When I was stuck with this fixation about wanting to be posted on social media, I stopped realizing the true intimacy that was in my relationship that could never compare. 

For example, my boyfriend was going to take a shower. He starts the shower but then comes back to the room and says “How about you wash my hair for me?” I don’t know if you guys have ever washed your partner - but it is probably the most intimate and purest thing, definitely top 5 on my list. I happily agreed, and as he sits down so I can lather his head because he’s so tall, I just think how happy and close with him I feel at that moment. And the thought that came to my mind was “You see, this is something you’ll never be able to see on social media.” 

Then, before I left the shower (I had already showered and he just needed basically a scalp treatment because his dandruff was bothering him) I brought him one of my wash cloths and told him to use it on his pits lol. When he gets back in the room, the first thing he does is run up to me and tells me to smell his armpits! Once again, I laugh and think to myself “Man, we have gotten way too comfortable with each other and I love it.” Another moment that would never be posted on social media. 

Another example, anytime he brings me a glass of water, he always grabs a cup that has kittens on it. Because I am obsessed with cats. I started noticing that he ALWAYS grabbed that cup, and he would go out of his way to wash it if it was dirty. There’s nothing really interesting about posting a photo of a cup - so that’s another sweet thing that doesn’t get posted. 

The point of sharing my story is that I’ve been there. I have some self esteem issues, coupled with anxiety. Sometimes it gets to me. And for a while, I lived with some sort of resentment towards my relationship because it didn’t look like the ones I saw online. But I am so glad I was able to realize the few points I mentioned at the beginning of my post. The minute I stopped comparing and accepting that my partner just simply isn’t one of those people who posts on socials, I started realizing and loving my relationship more genuinely. I know I am setting myself up for snarky comments, but I know a lot of people deal with this insecurity. I am here to tell you that your feelings are valid, but once you readjustment your mindset, you may start to see things more clearly."
Why do guys do think I'm crazy enough to say yes to this?,"I've noticed a trend in online dating. Guys will ask if you live alone or not. Then they will suggest bringing a bottle of wine or liquor over so we can chill and watch a movie aka Netflix and chill. My whole thing is WHY WOULD I BE INCLINED TO INVITE A STRANGER TO MY HOME? And why would they think I would go to their home and do the same??? Stranger danger. Smh I'm not trusting someone I never met before in a space alone. Especially not my home.

Also, I am not into anyone who can't be more exciting than wanting to chill inside the house. At least start off on a more exciting foot.

Lastly, if the person is trying to hook up I prefer for them to be forward and not waste their time with this tactic with me."
"If you can't tell if she's interested, read this."," Women.

&nbsp;

They can be extremely frustrating to deal with when it comes to figuring out if they’re into you or not.

&nbsp;

It’s a terrible feeling to read signals wrong and make a move, only to find out she didn’t intent to come off as interested, or that she was just being nice to you. It can really hinder your ability and confidence to feel comfortable with approaching the next woman. And in some cases, it can leave a really bad taste in guy’s mouths about women in general.

&nbsp;

These things suck, and I’ve seen a healthy amount of posts asking for ways to read into women’s interest. Does she like you if she’s playing with her hair? If she’s having a conversation with you? If she likes your shirt? Where the fuck do you draw the line from friendly to interested? 

&nbsp;

Fortunately, there are subtle things women do that indicate strongly that she’s interested in you, and that you’re golden for an approach. 

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

Generally, (because there are always expectations to the rule) women won’t come right out and tell you that they like you. It’s unfortunate, but it’s also reality in our current social climate. Women are taught to let the men pursue, let the men approach you first. Let the men ask to take you out. They’re taught that to openly pursue a man makes you look like a slut, a whore, an easy girl. And women try to avoid these types of labels.

&nbsp;

Because women are usually raised or conditioned in this manner, they don’t like taking the lead in regard to approaching. Luckily, they still like us, and they still want to help us understand when they like us. When a woman is interested in you, she’s much more likely to give hints and throw subtleties your way, hoping that you’ll pick up on what’s going on and make a move.

&nbsp;

A lot of guys will hear this and simply choose to not waste their time, which is understandable. Why put effort into a girl that can’t express how she feels?

&nbsp;

The thing about that mindset though, is that women that come right out and say “John, I really like you, and I’d like it if you took me out sometime,” are fucking rare. Very fucking rare. And if you decide to sit around and wait for that type of woman, you’ll be waiting for a *very* long time.

&nbsp;

When you don’t have the luxury of bold women approaching you, you’ve got to read the signs. And I’d like to share some valuable knowledge that **really** helped me out with knowing when a woman was genuinely interested in me, or was just being friendly or nice.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**If a woman is interested/comfortable with you, she’ll put herself in your orbit.**

&nbsp;

Now, what does this mean? 

&nbsp;

When a woman likes you, she'll go out of her way to be around you. She'll look for opportunities to touch you, speak to you, or just look at you if you're at a distance. This translates to the texting/calling game too. Have you ever had a girl you've known for a while just text you out the blue with ""Hey"", ""Hi"" or ""What's up?"". Secret gentlemen, she's putting herself in your orbit. She's more than likely hoping you'll take her *invitation* and turn it into a date. The simplest way to go about doing so is this. If a woman you're getting to know or dating texts/calls you, but isn't talking about anything in particular, schedule a date. She's thinking about you, and wants to see you. She probably won't come right out and say so, (I know, frustrating) but you've got to read between the lines.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**General Contact (Verbal/Texting)**

&nbsp;

Going back to putting herself in your orbit, what does this mean? Let’s say you've got someone who you work with. She seems to always greet you when you or she arrives. More interestingly, she always seems to find you, wherever you are, and say farewell when she or you leave. If a woman is constantly greeting you and wishing you well when one or both of you leave work, she's more than likely interested. Especially if she doesn't give everyone at the workplace the same kindness. She's putting herself in your orbit to make it easier for you to make a move.

&nbsp;

Women also carry out this same behavior over texts. If you receive a random text from a woman you’re dating, something along the lines of: 

&nbsp;

-	I just saw this random thing and it reminded me of you!
-	I just thought about that time we went to x!
-	Hey, what are you doing?
-	Are you doing anything today?
-	I just thought about you.
-	How are you? 

&nbsp;

She’s thinking about you. You crossed her mind, and instead of coming right out and saying, “I want to see you, ask me out,” or just asking *you* out on a date (again, frustrating, I know), she’ll put herself in your orbit, she’ll make her presence known, and hope that you understand her actions enough to realize she wants you, in some way, and should schedule a time to get together.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Physical Contact**

&nbsp;

Another way women put themselves in your orbit is through physical touch. Men, if a woman is constantly bumping/brushing up against you, she's interested. I don't care **what** anybody says. People are more than aware of their personal space. They will not consistently bump/brush up against someone that they do not find appealing, physically or in general.

&nbsp;

Likewise, if she's always touching parts of your body, again, she's interested. She's initiating the touch barrier and letting you know she's cool with physical touch. Obviously, don't lose your mind with this statement, that doesn't mean you're good to start squeezing her ass, but if a woman is touching you, it's her way to saying, ""I'm okay with you being physical with me"". 
&nbsp;

Again, it's more frustrating than her just saying ""I'm totally down if you touched me dude"", but again, woman aren't generally that forward.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

**Eye Contact**

&nbsp;

Finally, eye contact. Fellas, if you’ve caught a girl staring at you for the fifteenth time, she’s interested in you. I know you may think she’s starting at something behind you, or looking at somebody that happens to be close by you, but let’s be honest here. If you’re consistently finding her gaze at you, even when you **move** locations, she’s staring at something she likes, which is you.

&nbsp;

Now, I understand eye contact can be iffy at times. So, if you’re still on the fence on whether a girl is looking at you because she’s interested, or because she’s just so disgusted with you, the next time you catch you looking, maintain eye contact for a second, and **grin**. You don’t have to full on smile if you don’t want to.

&nbsp;

If she smiles back at you, even if she averts eye contact while doing it (it’s okay, she’s nervous), she’s interested, and she wants you to approach her. If she doesn’t smile back, and looks away, sorry champ, she isn’t into it.

&nbsp;

____

&nbsp;

These aren’t *all* the signs women show to express their interest in you, but they’re the basic things to look out for in you’re wanting to know if you’ve got a shot or not. Perhaps one day we’ll live in world where everyone can just be blunt and honest, without fear of rejection. But until that day, I hope this information can help you.

&nbsp;

Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! 

&nbsp;

I hear you guys loud and clear, you'd like a male version. I'll get working on it as soon as I can."
How does anyone find dating fun? It’s easily one of the worst things to go through in life,"Seriously it’s such a shit show. You go through hundreds of people and don’t find anything worthwhile 

For guys it’s even worse because your self esteem gets utterly crushed. You go on apps and swipe on 500+ women and get NO matches"
Unpopular opinion: Everyone has MORE THAN ONE soulmate,"Some people believe there’s a soulmate out there for everyone... The idea is that it’s a person who shares an off-the-charts type of connection with you right away. From the start, the two of you get on well with each other and feel a comfort level with each other that’s almost like you’ve known each other for years already.

But, other people believe that’s nothing more than a fairytale!

Yet, a third category of people is what this post is all about:

Do you believe there’s such a thing as a soulmate, but NOT just one of them out there for each of us?

I’ve run across a soulmate at least three different times in my life. How about you?"
"I meet a girl who is a complete geek on all things geeky 5 months ago, and it's going so well. It makes it all much more easier for dating.","I'm a 23 year old Black male, and she's 24 year old Colombian woman.

It's going so well, and the energy hasn't died down at all since we started to date. I always had a hard time getting a girlfriend, and got rejected a whole bunch of times. Even when I did had one, they all ended even when I tried my best to save it.

But this girl is different. I was just going through GameStop, and I was geeking out over a pokeball popcorn machine. She was actually just about to leave till she saw how excited I was. I didn't cause a disturbance, I was just really excited that it's in store finally. She approached me first, and talk about Pokemon. She even brought her 3ds, and we traded Pokemon. It was awesome that happened because soon after she wanted to hangout with me at a pizza place.

We did went to the pizza place(Stevie B's pizza), and had a awesome time getting to know each other a little bit more. It wasn't until we left she texted me she would like to go on a date. I was flabbergasted about it, but I was nonetheless excited. On the day we went on the date, everything changed. I was shy, so I tried to start small talk. I wasn't good, but I did my best. But it wasn't till she asked me my favorite superhero that we enjoyed each other company. I said Superman, and she said which one. I said Kingdom come, and she said red son Superman. After that, we talked about many geeky stuff so long we realized a hour passed because we were having a good time enjoying each other company.

Fast forward to now; We cook foods from cartoons, anime, and video games. We talk about geeky stuff up to 8 hour's sometimes. We even went on a date to a planetarium, zoo, and astronaut museum. For the first, I'm not awkward to a girl who enjoys my company. Rather she adores my company because she's able to be super geeky around me. We're open to each, we play fighting games together, we watch cartoon/anime movies together. It's so awesome and relieving to meet a lady that's as geeky as this.

My tip to all the shy geeky guy's. If you find a super geeky lady where she can geek out with you, and enjoy your company, you can definitely make a relationship work if you be yourself. This is so awesome, and I'm so happy."
"After 16 first dates in the last ~50 days, this is what I’ve learned...","16 women are not into me. Oh well, just gotta keep on moving 👍"
Dating apps would be vey different if people were honest,"Imagine a world where people were honest in the dating apps, after reading so many post and using my own experience I've realized that these apps lack this important aspect

\-Be honest on what are the reasons why you are on this app. If someone is looking for a one-nigh stand he should find someone who is also looking for that instead of playing with other's emotions

\-Be honest and tell me that you are just looking for attention

\-Tell me that you are not feeling it instead of just ghosting me

\-Instead of slowly pulling away just tell me that you are not that into me

\-State that you are also dating other people early on"
Just out of curiosity I created a fake women profile on tinder to see what would happen and here were the results. Do you women agree?,"First off I would say the majority of the guys, about 80% of them were absolutely terrible dudes. What I mean by terrible is most of these guys seem like they never seen a barbershop or shower in years! So just having pictures of yourself cleaned up and groomed will at the very least put you ahead of a lot of guys!! Another thing that stood out was that I seen a lot of bio’s that were basically begging women to match with them, basically crying out for a match. You have a better shot of not having a bio at all. I was really disgusted at my fellow brothers, your average male profile is down right pitiful. Most of these guys really need to get it together, it’s so obvious why most guys get zero matches, let alone an actual date. Women would you agree with what I saw? I can see why women get entertainment from it, most of the profiles had me laughing in tears."
Is it bad to take a shit before a date?,"I have some social anxiety and am not used to dating. In informal social settings, I tend to shake, but this is not a problem anytime else (like for work social settings or meeting new friends). Is it bad that I take a shot before dates? I asked a bouncer at a pre-date location to take a shot and he criticized me constructively. But my logic is, people who have anxiety take meds often, I just need one shot to loosen up for dates. Is that bad? 

I know how pathetic this sounds.... Trust me, I wish I was a rockstar and if it wasn’t for my anxiety, I would be super outgoing. :( but I’m too embarrassed of my shaking and I avoid dates because of it."
Beware Of Love Bombing,"I have been reading about ladies using the level of texting to tell whether a guy is into them or not but sometimes this isn't always true. Some guys in the very beginning will text you from morning to evening, say all the right words, compliment you day and night, send you all the beautiful songs etc and then when you are in so deep they will either ghost you or withdrawal which inturn will drive your crazy wondering what you did wrong, you will start apologising for things you didn't do and guess what, you will blame yourself for being too clingy and for messing up something so perfect! 

But you weren't in the wrong at all, some people use it as technique to get what they want by being the perfect prince charming, they will even plan the future with you and make you feel like they are the one! When it takes even longer or seems like they won't get it, they will ghost or withdrawal completely. It is never about you, its about them winning the game. 

So as you get so excited about him texting you every minute and thinking he can't get enough of you, ask yourself important questions? Listen to your intuition, if something is too good to be true, it often isn't true. 

Someone can text you all day because they are bored not because they can't get enough! Someone will text you twice a week because they are generally busy but they do really like you and want to know you! Also a word of advice stalking someone to see if they are online is unhealthy and will lead you to madness. Learn to know the person you are dealing with and don't let texting be the measure of how much that person loves you! There are so many ways to know someone loves you besides texting and the ultimate is being straight up and asking them.

This applies to both ladies and gentlemen. I hope it speaks to someone out there."
36 Questions Designed To Help You Fall In Love With Anyone,"The New York Times lists 36 questions you can ask someone if you want to fall in love. (Or make your love even stronger).

There are good men out there,"I accidentally drank too much on a second date last night. The night was long and the drinks were constant. I swore I was feeling fine, a little buzzed, and then all of a sudden it hit me like a sack of bricks.

I was in no place to be taking the train home alone. My date, one of the kindest guys I’ve ever gone out with, asked if I would be ok to take the train home. He was concerned for my safety and, based on prior interactions, I could tell this concern was genuine. 

He offered to let me stay at his place. I was reluctant, but it beat the alternative of going on the train and the possibility of falling asleep and missing my stop. He promised he would do whatever was needed to make sure I was safe and comfortable.

I decided to go and I said, “I’ll go with you bc I feel like you’re a good guy.” And he said, “I hope I can SHOW YOU that I am.” 

That night, he did everything possible to make sure I was ok. Kept bringing me water, gave me something to eat, got me medicine, sat with me and talked to me. He even got out his guitars and we played music and sang together. He didn’t pull anything weird or try to instigate anything remotely sexual. He stayed up the whole night with me. The next morning, he got me a bagel and went out to get me Advil. 

I share this because, GIRLS - I want to reiterate that there are decent guys out there. And I know, I KNOW, it seems like the world is scary and so many cannot be trusted; but, rest assured, genuinely good people exist. And more men should follow this example. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. "
I Went On Such An Awkward Date....,"I need to get this off my chest somewhere. Lol.
I’m on a cell, ignore the mistakes pls! So sorry in advance.

I met a guy on Tinder I thought seemed really cool! We chatted from daylight to dark it seemed, and had a lot in common. He was a single father, out of a divorce for a year. He told me why the previous marriages ended. 

Restrictions have lifted quite a bit in my state, so we agreed to meet. I’m actually in a county with barely a handful of cases.
Anyways, I offered to meet halfway. According to the app he was 78 miles away. He said no, he’d happily drive to {insert county} Bc he had kids in another state, and he was so use to driving! It didn’t bother him, no big deal!

So we meet, he wasn’t quite what I expected. I was okay with that though. I suggested we go eat, I wasn’t sure what else to do.
So we ordered, and convo seems to be going great and just flowing. Food comes, we eat. Towards the end the waitress lays our check on the table. Several minutes pass. He didn’t touch nor look at the check. She walked by maybe 5-6 times.
Finally I say “well guess I’ll have to get this” and handed her my card. She walks away and he said “oh do you expect cash or something for that?” He had a $10 in his hand. I do want to add, my meal was $9.99, my drink, I had about $13 on a $58 ticket. So yes he ordered an expensive steak dinner. So of course I wasn’t too thrilled. I said “oh well I guess you don’t have to if you don’t want to?” I’m too polite I know!! He shoves his money back in his pocket Bc he “didn’t want to”

After this we drive. I didn’t know what else to do. I was trying to be nice Bc he did drive quite a distance.
I need to add - He kept mentioned a hotel when he first got in. Even mentioned it on messages. How big it was etc.
I didn’t think too much about it. So I finally go back to his car and park. I said “well! I think I should be getting home to my kiddos.” But he kept mentioning the hotel. Was the pool open? It looked so nice. He had absolutely nothing at all to do the next day. He had to drive that far, it was him that drove that far and now he had to drive all the way back, maybe he should get a room.
He pulls out his phone and logs into a bank app, I assume. He starts saying “I don’t know where my money goes” then starts naming things down the list. He says gas like 4 times. He’s like “I mean I’m the one that had to drive” I said “yes I offered to meet you closer, you said numerous times you would rather come here.” He said “well my account is at 17, I don’t like it going below $15 but I really need a room Bc I had to drive and pay for gas” I’m not sure if he meant $1500 and $1700 or $15 and $17. Lol. I didn’t ask.
This was so awkward to me. I began to think about this. Did he want me to pay for a room for him?? What was he expecting.?? I was so confused.
I said 3 more times, well I had better get back home and pick up my kids, I have to work early tomorrow.
“Well I have absolutely nothing at all to do tomorrow and I had to drive here.”
We had sat here for about 3 hours with him saying he “loved my thick thighs” and kept touching my hair. He said he loved short hair Bc he could “pull on it” and grabbed the back of my head. Then he’d start again “you think that pool is open at the hotel?” Of course I didn’t know. Then “gosh I’d really love to have a room tonight” he said this maybe 4-5 times.

On the way home I began thinking. He had asked such odd questions, I don’t know why I didn’t notice before.
Like he asked what my parents did. Asked at a random time, not during a convo about their jobs or anything like that.
He also asked how much money I made, and if I currently had money. He also Complained about his ex wife never working and having to be the sole provider. He just got so fed up and couldn’t take it. That seemed like too much detail for me, esp to someone you don’t really know.

It was such an awkward and awful experience for me!! It makes dating so depressing!
I just needed to vent!"
"Girls go through the same struggles as us, right?","I don't mean this in a rude way, I'm just drunk af and want to speak my mind.

Sometimes I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that girls get ghosted, rejected and the same as us, due to the disproportoniate amounts of attention gotten on dating apps.

As I struggle to find a partner and feel hopeless, I struggle to feel that ladies feel the same way.

Can some ladies of this sub set me straight?"

## Tip 1: Build a solid foundation with values

Let's say you meet a guy and he seems great. But then you realize he's dishonest. That's a clear sign the guy is wasting your time. Dishonesty isn't a good place to start.

What do you need for an amazing relationship? *A solid foundation.* But how do you build it exactly? You need to know your values and make sure they match those of your romantic partner.

To understand your values, ask yourself questions like these:

· What kind of a family do I want?

· How important is communication to me?

· How much integrity and self-discipline do I expect from a partner?

· How much negativity can I tolerate?

Now, you need a guy with similar values.

## Tip 2: Don't idealize him

Let me use Robin Williams as an example.

He married his first wife, Valerie, at 26. Soon, Valerie realized he couldn't be faithful to her.

But she idealized him:

*He's the great Robin Williams and I can live with his infidelity, I guess.*

But that was her head making the choice. Whereas in her heart, she knew she was betraying herself. And they got a divorce eventually.

That said, you might meet a great guy. He's confident, successful, and funny. But there's still something you don't like about him. Don't idealize him for those good qualities to avoid time-consuming dating.

*Listen not just to your head but also to your heart.*

## Tip 3: Don't change him

Suppose, a guy you're dating says he can't commit to a relationship right now. But he's great otherwise.

And you think, “I can change him. I'll make him commit.”

They say that people don't change. I believe they do but only as long as they want it. Just because you want him to change doesn't mean that he will.

That said, I respect you for the willingness to help him change. Feeling your support is very important for a man. It helps him build a business or career and also grow personally. But why waste your energy on someone who doesn't care?

*Save it for the right person!*

## Tip 4: Don't go along because you want to be nice

Let me illustrate with an example of a girl who had a suppressive father.

He would get angry often. And she learned to be nice to him in those moments. Otherwise, he wouldn't have loved her—a scary thought for a little girl.

Now in her early thirties, she met a guy who was strong, confident, and aggressive. This guy would get angry with her just as her father did. And without much thinking, she was nice to him in those moments as well. That was her default behavior learned in childhood.

But after a while, her resentment got so huge that she couldn't take it anymore. And she broke up with him. But with dating being so time-consuming, she lost so much time.

*So, don't be nice when it feels wrong.*

Ask yourself:

· Am I being unreasonably nice to my partner?

· Can I stop going along with what I don't like?

· How do I be more assertive about what I need?

· How can I set my boundaries and keep them up?

## Tip 5: Let him know and let him go

If you don't like something about a guy you're dating, you've got to let him know. And if he doesn't want to change, let him go.

Let's say he doesn't want to commit to a relationship. Sit down with him and talk about it.

Use this formula from *How to Have a Good Day* by Caroline Webb:

· Warmth

· Explanation

· Offering an alternative

· Ending with warmth

Here's what you can say:

### Warmth

Thank you for being a great boyfriend.

I love how gentle and loving you are.

I want our relationship to work.

### Explanation

I need you to commit to the relationship.

If you can do it, I'll be the happiest girl ever.

### Offering an alternative

If you feel you can't, I'll respect that.

It'll break my heart but it'll be the right thing to do.

### Ending with warmth

Thank you for coming into my life.

I adore you.

### How you'll feel

As a result, you'll feel better. And you'll also feel inner peace.

You did what's right and now you can trust the universe to figure out what's best for you.

If he's right for you, he'll come back.

## Now, I want to turn it over to you

Which of these tips will you use to stop wasting time?

· Is it building a solid foundation with values?

· Or not hoping that he'll change?

**TL;DR;** : Dating is time-consuming unless you follow a good strategy. Take advantage of these helpful tips for women to avoid regretting the time lost."
"Best date ever, but disgusting ending","Me (24M, Belgian) had Tinder date a couple of days ago. We met, and instantly felt a great connection. We walked around town and sat at a pub for 8 hours straight and it literally was like the best date ever. We hit it off great, had a lot of fun (some great dark humor) and great conversation and we both felt both a physical attraction as well as a more serious connection on a more personal/emotional level. Time flew by, and it was the best date I ever had. We planned a new date a week later to the Belgian natural history museum, and were just walking home to her place at around 3 or 4 a.m., where we would watch some porn (for some reason, we wanted to discus the graphic details in some explicit Anime/Hentai movies). Anyway, as we're walking to her place, we ended up talking about the one time she had intercourse with another girl. She said it was a great experience, but a one time thing. She said she certainly was not lesbian because lesbians/gays have a disease, according to her. I was shocked. For some time I kept questioning her about this, and turns out she strongly beliefs non-heterosexuals have a genetic disease, are worth less than others and in an ideal world they should be dead. Then, she went on by trying to justify her homophobia (or convince me of it) by saying ""of course I think this, I also am racist because I am smart"". Isn't that a great line of reasoning (btw, she actually is smart as she is a PhD student just like me). Turns out, she felt people from other races were worth less and should have less/no human rights in order to make them become extinct in the future. She was not kidding.

Anyway, I felt sick in my stomach upon realizing she was homophobic and racist. I sat down for 2 minutes on the street as I was quite shocked, then said something to her and just walked away. Now, I feel like an idiot for really liking this girl, having like the best date ever only to realize she is so sick in the head. I mean, I really cannot stand homophobia or racism. It is the first time I had such an awesome date, also as I don't have that much dates as I am not the most social person. Now, I don't think I will date for a while as I feel the universe is playing tricks on me."
I [25F] went on the most perfect first date and I’m afraid to tell anyone because I don’t want to jinx it.,"I replied to a guy who id been following for a while’s instagram story of a meal he was having saying the restaurant he was at was my favorite. We talked for a week or two and he asked me if he could take me out on a date and show me his favorite.

For some reason the day of the date I was excited instead of the usual nervousness. I met him at his job and we took the subway to the restaurant. He ordered his favorite meals (nearly half the menu) and we shared a bottle of wine.

He joked about not liking small talk and I suggested we pretend like it’s our third date instead of our first. We then talked about some pretty serious things like family dynamics, my father abandoning me as a child, our past relationships, and everything in between. 

He then told me he wasn’t looking to mess around, he was looking for something serious that could potentially lead to marriage. Normally I’d be put off by a statement like that but I wasn’t. 

The last two guys I dated were so hesitant they didn’t even want to call our dates “dates”. One of them ghosted me. The other told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship after months of me trying to define what we were. And here this guy was, telling me exactly what he wanted in a matter of fact way.

We left the restaurant but neither of us wanted to go home so he suggested we go for a walk. He asked me if it was okay if he put his arm around me and I said yes. We walked to a street corner and were waiting to cross the street when he pulled me in closer and kissed me. 

I’ve never felt a kiss like that, I literally didn’t care that we were kissing in the middle of the street and there were people walking by and watching. He then got me a cab home and told me he was going away for vacation for two weeks on Thursday but that he really wanted to see me one more time before he left. So we agreed to see each other again tomorrow. 

I just have butterflies all day today and I’m so excited to see him again. I have such a good feeling about this guy, I wish I could explain it without sounding crazy.

EDIT: I knew when I wrote this post, there would be a lot of cynical, Debbie downer comments. I myself am a cynical Debbie downer sometimes. “He’s just trying to get in your pants”, “he’s lying”... etc.

While these may be true, I’m sticking with my happy feelings instead. He has done nothing to show me that he’s lying or that he’s being sketchy. He has wine and dined me without asking for a single thing in return. He got me a cab home and didn’t ask to come over. All green flags in my book. 

So I’m choosing to be happy and excited and bubbly for now. 

And if he turns out to be a horrible, dishonest person, then I’ll cross that bridge when I get there."
Bf and I fell in love while on shrooms during COVID-19 pandemic!,"Ok so I just wanted to share my story because before this happened, I was searching for threads like this all over reddit and Google and couldn't find that many! And I hope this short (long) story inspires some hope for those lost hopeless romantics who feel like they'll never find ""the one""!

Alright so I (22 f) started talking to this guy (21 M) I had as a friend on Facebook but never really talked to. We had people in common, went to different schools, but didn't really know each other personally (aside from Facebook stuff).


Anyway, I had just gotten out of a long term relationship that i had already gotten over months prior. (On and off and not a good time).


So I was reading this book at work one day, and out of the blue I thought to myself ""hey this main character description sounds a lot like this guy I have as a friend on Facebook."" I ended up messaging him at around 6am to tell him. I have no idea why, I just wanted him to know, and I wanted him to read the book. Anyway a few messages later, he said he was interested in reading the book! I was so excited. I love when people take interest in things I'm interested in, because I love discussing them. Anyway I didn't think much of it, I was mostly excited that he wanted to read the book. So I said he could borrow my copy, and i would drop it off after work. WELL the copy I had at the time wasn't even mine, it was borrowed (from a patient of mine). 

So right after work, I drove to the nearest barnes & noble (20 miles from my house) and got the book. This store is located inside a shopping mall, so while I was there, I picked up a bunch of makeup and clothing because I was so excited. It wasn't until after I got into my car that I asked myself ""why am I so excited? Why did I buy all this stuff?"" So he told me where he lived, I drove to his house to drop off the book. I was so nervous. He finally came out, i gave him the book through the car window, he got it and rushed off back into his house and said ""thanks! Sorry I gotta go. I have something on the stove.""
I was like wow okay I guess thats is. I mean what did I expect? 


But NO. We ended up talking more and more and hanging out almost every single night. It was ALWAYS an adventure with this guy. He didn't even have to try. Somehow the night just always ended up being so much fun. We hung out at this lake by our town mostly and just talked. Or we'd go to some views around the city. This went on for about 3 weeks. 

During that whole time, our relationship was completely platonic. We did not confess feelings for each other, we did not compliment each other, we did not flirt AT ALL, we did not kiss, hug, hold hands, go to each others houses, we didn't make crude jokes about sex or dating. It was like we were becoming close friends. Not once did he flirt with me or try to make a move. NOT. ONCE.


So when we first started hanging out, I was guarded and told myself I would not develop a crush for this guy and I would not flirt with him or allow myself to catch feelings. I even restricted myself from admitting he was cute. I limited myself to only talking about past relationships vaguely and not talking about my interests in guys or relationships. I will admit i did this mostly because I thought this guy was WAY out my league, even before I met him. He's one of those guys that gets a bunch of likes on Facebook and gives off those talks-to-a-million-girls vibes. At least thats what i thought back then (yes i know I'm ashamed for thinking this way). I didn't want him to think I was just another girl that was going to be all over him. 


So over time I actually started to catch myself day dreaming about him. I would immediately stop myself. I was really trying not to like this guy. But I couldn't help it. He has an amazing personality, he's so much fun without even trying to be. He always seemed so genuine and never tried too hard at anything. He didn't try to impress me he was just himself. And I always thought he was soooo handsome. But too handsome for me. I mean i think I'm okay looking, but at the time I just thought this guy would never see me that way. Especially with how interesting he is. I considered myself pretty boring. The home-body type.


So one day he told me about his shroom experience. That was probably the first time he told me something so personal. He told me he used to be really quiet, shy, insecure, angry. I was really surprised because this did not seem like him at all. He wasn't shy when first meeting me. He's so patient and nice. He always had something to talk about. He just seemed like the perfect social butterfly.


I had never experienced shrooms before, but I was interested. So a few weeks later, I decided I wanted to try something new.


My life was in a great place. I was newly single, my career was taking off. I loved my job, was making really good money, things at home were great, my friends were all around me. This guy was making things really interesting. Life was just awesome.


So I decided I wanted to try shrooms. I did so. Much. Research. I researched for days. Any chance I got, I spent planning and researching. I ended up coming up with this idea. I'd find us a really nice comfortable place where we could trip safely. I really wanted this to be an unforgettable experience for him (at the time I wouldn't admit why). So i first asked him if he wanted to do shrooms. He said yes. I asked about his schedule for work. So I ended up getting an air bnb really cheap (very beginning of pandemic, pre-stay-at-home enforcement).


 I planned the whole thing. What we would eat. Activities while we tripped. I got different type of bud just in case he had a preference. I made sure the air bnb was in a woodsy location because I knew he was really into that type of environment. I had to locate a plug for the shrooms too which is not easy in a small town, but i was determined!!
I was soooo ready!


Its important to note that at this time, I was so not sure if he liked me or even found me attractive. He was so aloof. Never complimented me on my looks. Never made a move. Never really showed an interest in me other than just as friends.(Although we never discussed this or had the ""I'm only looking for friends conversation"") I just assumed he only wanted to be friends because of his lack of hinting.


So I decided to just drill it into my brain that this was completely for the shroom experience and would not be romantic at all (me desperately trying not to get my hopes up or formulate unrealistic expectations).
So the day came, he was ready, and we headed up the mountain completely innocent and clueless.


The drive was unbelievably beautiful. Everything was so clear and green with amazing views of the mountains and sparkly lakes. He showed me his favorite music. He had even made me a playlist on spotify. It was becoming harder and harder to not get my hopes up. Every time I looked over at him I just kept thinking holy cow this handsome and unbelievably interesting guy is really taking the time out of his day and willingly spending his weekend with me 😰 


I'll admit I was a bit skeptical at first, how was this guy so perfect? Why has he been hanging out with me so much? Why hasn't he tried anything? I kept waiting for there to be a catch 👀 (to this day, four months later, there has been no catch, he's still perfect!)


So we got to the cabin. Of course it's beautiful. The view is incredible. BUT there's only one bedroom. Only one bed. I nervously explained to him that this was the best cabin with the best view and the best reviewed and that i didn't intend for us to sleep in the same bed, it was just the best choice. He said it was alright not a problem. I offered to sleep on the couch but of course, he said no that he would. So we explored for a bit. Prepared ourselves for the trip and got comfortable. Watched some movies while we waited for it to get dark. (Still nothing romantic at this point).


Then the time came for the shrooms! He ate them whole and i made mine in tea. Holy cowwwwww it WAS THE BEST FEELING AND EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I was tearing up for no reason. We were watching tippy music videos and just laughing and vibing. We kept expressing how beautiful everything was. And after a little while i started to really admire him. His smile just looked so beautiful and his eyes were extra shiny and i loved it. 

I ended up getting really nervous being around him but I couldn't tell him why because I didn't want to ruin things. I just covered myself with a blanket and sat on the couch as far from him as possible. He could tell something was wrong and was trying to comfort me. I could tell he was concerned so I tried my best to just act normal again. We were laughing again and I have no idea how we ended up in each other's arms but next thing you know he's smiling and laughing and then KISSED ME. I felt like I was a little kid again and It was like fireworks went off in my chest, I was like at the peak of my trip. After we stopped kissing, he said ""hold on, I'll  be right back."" I thought he was going to tbe bathroom. But when he came back, he was holding a small box in his hand, he gave it to me and I was completely shocked. He said ""i got this for you."" I open it and its this beautiful heart shaped necklace, the color of my birthstone, with matching earrings. I nearly died. This has never happened to me in my.life. I had never felt so wooed. 


After that, we just cuddled on the couch together. We were both super quiet. He kept asking if I was alright. Hell yeah I was better than alright. I just couldn't stop thinking about how amazing I felt and how much I loved what happened and how everything fell into place so perfectly. I couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I felt and I swear I felt like I was in a movie. The cabin was warm and cozy, it was super cold outside and foggy, and i was lying in this amazing guys' arms after he kissed me and gave me this amazing gift. I was quiet from the disbelief I was experiencing, but I'm pretty sure he thought I was quiet because I felt weird about what happened. I got up after a while and said I was going to bed. I was still kind of tripping at this point but for some reason I wanted to go to bed. 


After I got into bed, he came in a few moments later (as I hoped he would) and asked if we could share the bed. My heart almost exploded. He came in and we just started to spill the beans. He confessed that he really liked me, but never made a move because he didn't want me to feel like he was only hanging out with me to get with me and because he didn't want me to feel like things were moving too fast. He didnt want me to feel pressured. I confessed my feelings as well and we both couldn't stop talking about how we felt like we were in a movie and how we were just perfect for each other. This went on the whole night until almost morning time. He kept telling me he thought I was beautiful and interesting and perfect in every way. He kept holding me tight and seemed so happy. I'd never seen anyone so happy. 


We ended up having sex. AMAZING SHROOM SEX. We were coming down already but it was still out of this world.


We ate in the morning and then cuddled some more. We couldn't get enough of each other. On the drive home we held hands and couldn't stop talking about our feelings for each other and about the experience. 


We've been together 5 months now and I can honestly say I understand cheesy romance movies now. Hes still very lovey-dovey, we understand each other so well, we love doing things together. Despite our previous failed relationships we have NO trust issues. Not at all. Literally the only problem we have is that we both get cranky when we're hungry.

My family immediately accepted him. His family is the same with me. We've pretty much been dating throughout the whole pandemic and I honestly think it has made us really close. We're best friends and I honestly don't think theres any toxicity in our relationship. We communicate sooooooo well. We're both there for each other and it's amazing. We both have gone through so many things in the short time we've been together, but somehow, every issue seems so small because we get through these things together. Its just amazing how quickly someone can change your life so unexpectedly! We've both changed so much already in many different ways (for the better) in such a short amount of time!
It feels so unreal. I honestly never thought I could fall for someone. I really thought people just pretended to be happy or something. But nope healthy love is real!!! Anyway i just wanted to share this because I really love our story!! I hope everyone out there feeling like they'll never find ""the one"" read this and get a little hope out of it! It was 100% unexpected for him and I so i hope its the same for you :D!"
Do very attractive people get treated differently? Almost frowned upon? Serious question o,"A friend of mine who is perfect looking, with amazing facial features were talking about it today about dating and she mentioned she gets judged very easily because of her looks. For example, she is interested in someone who most would say isn't each others type. She said the people she dates have had the other persons friends reach out to her and ask what her motive was,
Gold digging, cat fishing etc ( basically saying what are you doing with that person). And I'm genuinely curious to if anyone else experiences this. We also talked about how most girls frown upon her for no reason, can people just simply dislike a person because they are to good looking?"
Can we please stop pretending that men are the only ones capable of being terrible?,"Two years ago I dated a woman who was a cousin of one of my friends. We met at a birthday party and I asked her out. We hit it off. She had just gotten out of a relationship, but was fine with dating me. We got along great. Had the same interests, texted or saw each other everyday, etc.. I took her out to dinners and beach trips, all paid for by me cause she was broke and had no job. I did everything for this person and I wasnt expecting anything in return besides a little respect and gratitude. I even found her a job and helped her with a car payment at one point. Shortly after helping her find a job she came to me with ""I dont want to be intimate with you anymore, because I feel like I'm not over my ex still"". My response was that I was fine with it. She suggested proceeding as friends and I agreed. Then a week later I find her tinder profile advertising to do the very same activities she was doing with me the last few months. She also had been making mild comments about dating other guys when we would hang out. I called her out on her shit and the chaos that ensued ended my friendship with her and my mutual friend. She basically tried to claim that I only wanted to be friends so that I could date her again at some point. She also(conveniently) never paid me back some money I had lent her and started ghosting me. The irony is that on social media, people praise her for being strong and independent and I'm treated like the asshole. I wish that she had just told me why she really wanted to stop dating me and start seeing other guys. Ladies please, if you're gonna stop dating a guy, please be honest about why. How are we ever supposed to improve if you cant be honest about what went wrong or didnt click?

Tl;dr woman used me as a rebound and I'm considered the asshole.

Edit: Gonna clarify a few things since people dont read/misinterpret things. I dated this person for 3 months. She joked about dating other guys a week AFTER we stopped dating, which was a flag for me considering that the reason she wanted to stop seeing me was supposedly that she wasnt over her ex. Also, this person was doing a myriad of other things in an attempt to string me along. Such as complaining about why I dont text her every day anymore the week after we stopped dating."
Just a friendly reminder for those of us struggling out there,"Don’t forget that YOU’RE THE CATCH!!! You’re an awesome person and you deserve a super awesome mate who values you for you. I know it sucks being rejected but it’s probably not even about you. There’s unlimited valid reasons that it doesn’t work out. Nothing is wrong with you. Maybe take a break to reflect on how awesome you are before the next round. Play the game. Fist bump.

Edit: if some of you are bringing all this negative energy into dating then it seriously might be time to consider taking a break. I hope you’re able to find some qualities you like about yourself, and I promise looks aren’t everything to everyone. Be kind to yourselves."
"Being a decent person shouldn't be seen as a positive, it should just be something you do.","I saw a post about it and other people agree, basic decency when it comes to dating seems to be at an all time low.  Some people act like they're nice and polite and ""a good listener"" like it's some kind of huge plus, when in reality it's something you should always be doing without thinking about it. 

Like look at it this way - I don't act like wearing a shirt when I leave my house makes me some kind of good person, I just do it.  Decency should be the same way - things like making sure the other person is comfortable with the place you're going, not pushing things on people they don't want to do, manners, not leading people on, letting people know you aren't interested instead of ghosting them - you should do these things because they are the right thing to do, not because you expect something in return from them.

And let me be clear, you can be decent and still keep your boundaries.  Like for example, if a guy doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he can decline that if a girl suggests it and it doesn't make him an asshole, but it does if he does it anyway and expects something in return for it. Does this make sense? I promise you if you do these things, the right people will notice and it will take you far."
"European style of dating: They don't ""date"". They hang out and see what happens.","I'm probably being too broad when I say ""european"". When I first heard there was not a strong tradition ""dating"" over there (specifically France) I wondered what that meant. I was told by a friend that it simply meant you hung out with people with no preconditions or assumptions. Then if the mood and timing was right, you acted on it.

I have dated over the past year. For the most part I've avoided putting any real effort into dating for about 4 months now. This ""euro style"" came to mind because I think I have accidently found myself doing that. Let me draw some comparisons.

&#x200B;

**Example 1**

I did go on a ""date"" with someone about a month ago. We met through a dating site. 

* This means we were both trying to process each other.
* Understand if we could be partners.
* We probably had our mind on the potential of romance, overlooking the potential for friendship.
* We probably both wondered IF sex was a possibility.

Under that setup there's a lot of pressure and it didn't work out. It was a date and so I only analyzed it from that perspective and I imagine she did to some extent as well.

&#x200B;

**Example 2**

**Here's an example of another recent situation.** I asked out a coworker with very honest intentions: I wanted to socialize and make friends.

* I thought she was cute but I was not necessarily super attracted to her but I didn't care because I wasn't trying to ""date"" her.
* I didn't entirely care whether she liked me too much. I just wanted a friend at work and meet a new person.
* Eventually when her and I hung out at a bar, I did not necessarily consider it a date. She didn't either. I didn't really have strong interest in her at the time. 
* However as the months passed... we've both realized we really enjoy each other's company more than we expected. There's a lot of flirtation and tension there. It's fun.

What made Example 2 so interesting is that I was never focused on asking myself if she sees me as a romantic partner. It allowed us to just take our time and get to know each other.

\------

**Does anyone else prefer this non-dating approach? It seems more sensible to me. It seems more patient.**"
The girl I’m dating made me a playlist,"So I’ve been on two dates with a girl who’s pretty quiet, because she’s quiet I sometimes second guess myself that she actually likes me. 

After the second date we were on our way back to hers when she passed out in the Uber and was sick on the sidewalk. I helped her roommates get her into bed and slept on the couch because I’m not an asshole. The next day we chilled together until like 4pm when she had work, I made her pancakes as a hangover cure and we just cuddled in bed all day, it was great. 

Anyway fast forward to now, we’re both away for the week and I’m second guessing myself again when she texts me saying she made me a playlist called “To ‘my name’” (we both love music). I thought this was one of the coolest things someone has ever done for me two dates in and it made me grin for 5 minutes straight, it made me feel so likeable. I made one for her too to reciprocate, but god damn I can’t stop listening to it."
A Dating Handbook for Guys: How I've Had Many Successful Dates,"**Disclaimer**: This isn't a rulebook. This worked for me and there is no one right way to date. Do whatever works for you. I don't mean for this to sound braggy either, I've been ghosted and had bad dates as well! I just found some things that helped and wanted to share.

Also, I'm measuring ""success"" as finding someone who reciprocates your feelings and shows mutual interest. Not necessarily ""we had sex on the first date.""

Let's begin.

**The app:**

* It's 2019, we're all on the apps, Hinge and Bumble I've had the best luck on, in that order. Make sure your photos are decent quality and show your face up close and whole body. 
NO shirtless mirror pics, no selfies if possible. Make sure your main (1st photo) is clearly only you so girls don't have to guess which one you are in a group photo.

* It's important to approach dating, as a guy, from the perspective that you are qualifying them. Too many guys are trying to impress, compliment, and put women on a pedestal. Once you match with a girl, see if she's even what you are into. Any connection there? Great, after 10 min or an hour (whenever you get a feeling she's what you're into) I would usually drop, ""I'm not on here much, [my phone number] text me if you want."" 9/10 times I'd get a text within 10 minutes. 

**Texting**:

* At this point you're seeing if you want to get a 1st date together. Usually I'd ask for an IG profile if they didn't have good pics to make sure they really look how they appeared in the dating app. 

* I like asking, ""What are a few things you like about yourself that don't have to do with your appearance?"" This requires a bit of depth and weeds out the superficial girls. Also, you get to know them on a slightly deeper level early on.

* I've run text conversations for an hour or a few days if I'm unsure about a date. At some point I'd say, ""Do you want to get drinks some time?"" Again, 99% of the time they say yes. Think about it, they matched with you, kept talking in the dating app, took your number down, texted you first, kept texting you for however long, so there's a high chance they agree to a date!

**The first date:** 

* Text her the morning of, ""I'm excited to meet you later, I'll see you at [time agreed upon]!"" This allows her to confirm she's going. If she doesn't respond she's not interested and is a shitty human being for ghosting you the day of. Let it go and move on.

* It's always drinks. I know it sounds boring but if the date is a disaster, doesn't look like her photos, is weird, you finish your drink and leave. You're not stuck eating, waiting for a check, waiting for a movie or game to end. 

* Know a little about the bar you're going to beforehand and pick a quiet area so you can actually hear eachother. 

* Get there 5 minutes early and order.

* Stand up when she arrives and give her a FULL HUG, no side hug, no fucking hand shake, no kissing, just give a solid hug (like 2 seconds) and say how nice it is to see them.

* Ask them questions! Remember you're seeing if this is someone you want to continue dating. Moments of silence are OK, maintain healthy normal eye contact but be direct. 

* After about 1.5 hours I typically say that I'm ready to call it a night if they are. It's good to end the 1st date on a high note. Ironically if you guys are having a good time and you call the date to a close this does seem to make them consider that you were not having a great time. Personally I just don't like sitting and talking for a long ass time. 

* ALWAYS PAY FOR THE DRINKS. They should offer but just fucking pay. Chances are you picked the bar, you knew the drink prices, and you shouldn't be taking people out if you can't afford a few drinks. If they offer to leave the tip I always let them. Paying can actually help out later, I'll bring it up again.

* Walk them to their car give them a hug and say, ""I had a really great time."" 

About 70% of the time the girl would text me when she got home thanking me for the drinks or commenting on the date being nice. 

Forgot to mention, get the door for them especially if you're driving. 

**MORE DISCLAIMERS: I wrote the above in a way that makes it sound like I'm literally saying exactly what to do, I'm not, I'm just saying that's what I've done. Every date is different and complex, I've made out at the end of a 1st date because I texted/talked to a girl for a week before, and then I've had dates where I texted the girl for 2 days before going out together so there wasn't as much chemistry yet. Do what works for you!**"
Shout out to the friends,"Hey all,

Just wanted to give a shout out to all our friends who support us as we try our hand at dating.

I had arranged for a second date with a girl tonight, all sorted out, both looking forward to it then she starts ghosting me.

Talking to a friend this afternoon saying that ""Man I think I'm getting stood up tonight.""

His immediate response, was ""No your not, I will meet you at 8pm, and we will have the best bro date""

Just wanted to give him a shout out, the guy didn't skip a beat to support me and turn what would have been a pretty horrible night into a great one.

Edit:

So an update for you guys. We met at the indoor mini golf place we have drinks, we play, we actually meet some really nice couples playing golf in front of us and behind us.

We go to a pub after to keep the good vibes going. He let me talk out my disappointment, we discuss strategy so it doesn't happen again. Also had fantastic laughs thinking about ""what if she actually turned up!""

But great night the search continues"
UPDATE: A Tinder Story,"First of all, I want to say thank you to everyone who liked, commented, supported, and/or messaged me. The past days has been a massive mix of excitement and nerves. But just forty minutes ago, I ordered an appetizer for us. Then I got up and got down on one knee. We were smacked dab in the middle of a busy restaurant. Everyone started looking, her hands covered her mouth. I asked her to marry me. 


AND SHE SAID YES!!!!!!!!

I feel so fucking blessed! (Sorry for the profanity). The entire restaurant clapped for us. The waitress said she will give us a free dessert if we want. My ~~girlfriend~~ fiancé is crying tears of joy and calling her family and is so excited she is asking wedding questions and venue stuff. She has had a venue planned ever since she was a little girl and wants a big wedding. I preordered it last week and she is getting the wedding of her dreams. 

I can’t wait to be a husband and a father. I’m just hungover in happiness. But I also want my shrimp bolognese to be done already."
The hardest part about dating as a man is that women are attracted to you for being confident. But your confidence is constantly tested.,"There was an interesting exchange I saw earlier this week on facebook. In a group I am in. One of the leaders. A really confident guy that is always happy go lucky, made a post about how girls always want him as a bf. Someone responded about how hard it is really to achieve that, and everyone piled on and made fun of him, calling him cringy and creepy. this sort of exchange happens in all the circles i am in. It would probably happen to me too if I didn't hide my feelings.

The fact of the matter is that we men can't show our feelings. We can't show weakness. We can't show vulnerability. That is cringy, creepy and draws women away. Everyone piles up and boots us in the face if we do.

I don't know how to explain it. Its like the confident guys get propped up and the unconfident guys get torn down. And that is why so few men get women.

And I think. Thats just how human beings are wired to be. It makes sense. We evolved such that strong men are rewarded. There is no escape from it.

I'm sorry. I'm not angry. I don't hate anyone (except myself really). Its just like. I understand more and more why I don't deserve love and I'm trying to process it a lot better.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Damn this thread got big.

OK so everything I have heard hear I actually have heard before. There is a lot of:

\- Just believe in yourself it will happen eventually

\- Don't fall for toxic masculinity. Women love vulnerable men

\- Just take a break.

\- Get therapy

\- Workout

\- Fuck you. Your too negative.

\- You wouldn't want the attention anyway. If you actually try you'll get a quality relationship

\- You are better than you think you are

\- Get hobbies and make friends. It will make you happier

&#x200B;

Don't know what to say guys. I have been sadposting on reddit for years. I appreciate your responess though .

&#x200B;

I do find that there are general patterns of what people say. And I wonder if it reflects more on you guys and your situations vs me. Dunno really. I am not saying anyone is wrong. Its just . I guess it feels I am alone in this one way or another.

Also those of you that have sent you encouraging dms thank you very much. I know others experience this as well. Honestly. when I see someone else facing loneliness i want to encourage them more than me. I am weird. It is easy for me to love others and not myself. I am fated to guide people to a treasure i can not possess myself.

&#x200B;

Guys ;\_; sniff. Ty for posting. I don't deserve this. So I am going to be warmer a bit. I'm actually startging to cry now."
Can you remember a time that you felt so in love and now its just this nostalgic feel when you think of it?,"I’d just like to hear some stories and other experiences. Here’s one that comes to mind: 

We’d skip school and stay in my room, and it was closer to the summertime so it was hot out. The windows would be open and a really cool, fresh smelling breeze would fill the room while we’d nap. I cant smell a fresh breeze without thinking of that!!

There was one time we danced in the rain at a parking lot. I just felt so different during those times, and it’s indescribable. I feel like I can remember every little detail"
I'm (M26) going to start taking myself on dates.,"After the letdowns and false hopes and waste of time I get from online dating, I decided I am going to take myself on dates from now on. I deleted all my dating apps and bought single tickets to a local TEDx talk and a concert that I'm really interested in. 

&#x200B;

For all the times we try to take someone on a fun date or adventure and they end up either not being into it or things just fizzle out, when is the last time you took yourself out? I know that other people who go to these things have the same interests. Without a date you're pretty much free to talk to whoever you want and just share the experience. 

&#x200B;

I'm just excited to be making myself a priority instead of constantly trying to think about some girl I matched with or wishing things had gone better with a date. It's easy to ignore the good things in life so for anyone else struggling, try looking up some local events and just go. Go with no expectations and just focus on enjoying yourself.

Be strong y'all."
Am I the only one?,"Do any other females feel like they’re the one asking all the questions when texting a new guy? I feel like I just get answers, and I’ll have ask a follow up question to keep the convo going. So frustrating.."
"""Quarantine and chill"" is trash","To the men asking women to ""quarantine and chill"" on dating apps or putting it in their profile: that needs to stop. It's a stupid, unsafe idea and is an automatic turn-off."
so I ended it,"I’m a 25M. The last couple of months I’ve been seeing a woman that I really liked. We talked and talked for days, went to a concert and had dinner together a couple of times. She spent a couple of nights at my place but we never had sex because her interest in me was, at least what she said, only as friends. I have been through a bad relationship in the past and we’ve been friends for 5 years before we started dating and that was a toxic relationship. Before we started she slept at my place too, cuddled and teased but never really did anything more. Now this dynamic that I have been “offered” now was quite similar to the one 5 years ago.

I liked her, she was witty, smart, had dark humor, ambitions, was beautiful and charming. 

I have been somebody who is sleeping around most of my past 10 years. I rarely connect to people on a deeper level. And that is why I was hopeful that this would go on and could turn into something beautiful.

But I am proud of myself that I stopped it. I realised I am fulfilling her needs for closeness and I think love should not be like that.

I think love should be limitless. Love without negotiations about “what we should be”.

I think it should free you and not make you nervous, I think it should feel like a safe harbour and not make you want to play a certain role to be likable.

I’m proud of myself for setting boundaries and even though I liked this girl so much I would respect myself and my needs and call it off because she could not meet them.

I feel like I’m going crazy because I had this opportunity infront of me but decided not to got for it and hopefully it will be worth it one day.

Respect yourself people. Respect your needs, your emotions, your wishes. Don’t throw yourself out there for somebody who just wants to hang out with you because of their needs.

There are so many of us in this world. We’ll find each other eventually.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone replying and upvoting, I had no idea it would be this popular. So awesome to see there’s other people that lived the same situation and I’m proud of everyone of you who showed self respect. Thanks for all the replies and the gold."
Turning 24(M). Most of my friends have been in multi-year relationships and are getting married. Is it normal to already feel too old to date?,"When I step outside and try to be objective, 24 still feels young. But at the same time, I'm starting to feel a little bit of that 'anyone who wants to be in a relationship already has one' syndrome and I feel like starting to date now is setting me up for single parents or desperate people looking to settle, and I'm not desperate enough to jump into either."
Being a former college athlete is not a personality trait,Has anyone else stumbled upon 30+ year olds on dating apps with pictures from their college sports days? It’s great that you played competitively but can we move past this now or...?
I DONT WANT TO BE ALONE ANYMORE,"Just putting this out there. Hoping the universe will take the hint and please deliver. It's been a long 25 years of being single and not ever experiencing what it feels like when a guy is interested in you... thanks for your time and attention

Edit: wow glad to know so many people relate to this. I am putting these vibes into the universe for you as well and hoping something good comes your way!

@ the rest of you making assumptions about me being unhappy: I appreciate the concern but please chill. I'm doing great. I have my dream career, my family and friends are the best anyone could ask for, and I am smart and hilarious (as u can tell from this post lol) and cute AF. I have a full life and I'm happy but I still want a relationship, ok?!? This post was just me expressing this in a very obvious way because for some reason it's not clear to the universe (or men... hello I am cute AF what is taking them so long) that I would LIKE TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN PLEASE."
Is it weird to feel turned off when girl talks about partying?,"I'm not sure why, but whenever I talk with a girl and she talked about partying, I start losing interest. I don't party often, but still gone clubbing and made out with random girls and stuff. But for some reason whenever a girl talks about how last year she went on spring break and partied nonstop or how she loves to drink,  it's just an instant turn off for me? Even though I'm not against these things? Like it's fine if a girl mentioned partying (everyone gonna party especially if you love in a big city ) but when they go in detail talking about drunk they were and stuff, then it turns me off. Anyone else like this?"
"If they wanted to, they would","I just wanted to put it out there for everyone and myself who are currently being “ghosted”. There’s a difference between someone being busy and getting ghosted. If the person wanted to text you, they would. If they wanted to call you, they would. People make time for who they want to make time for.. we all have the same 24 hours in a day. I know the phone works both ways and you can reach out to them. But if you find yourself being the one always reaching out take it as a sign and move on. Don’t chase someone that doesn’t want to be chased. There should always be a balance."
I didn’t know adult life would be so lonely!,"Like damn I just work, go to the gym and eat. My friends are far away and I barely meet new people. I used to be so excited for the weekends, now I don’t even care. I just can’t even picture a scenario where I’d find someone to date. 

I think I’m just kind of looking for some validation that I’m not the only one feeling this way. I’ve been using dating apps for the first time and it’s just depressing. Seeing all these people put on display and I’m one of them, seems so unnatural. I was swiping through people the other day and just felt bad.

I feel like I’m a pretty desirable person. I workout a ton, have my shit together and am comfortable talking to people. But I’m really struggling just finding people to meet! 

I went back to my college town recently and it reminded me how much has changed. Back there I hung out with a ton of people every day again and even got some numbers. But that fizzled out because I live so far away. 

It also makes me sad that there are literally 0 women I work with. Not even in the sense that I’d try to date a coworker. But I’m not even talking to women casually, like ever!

Sorry for the rant but it’s Friday night and I’m just sitting in my apartment alone wondering what I have to do to change this.

Edit: I thought I would share the pathetic reason that inspired me to post this.

Today when I was making dinner I found out I bought the wrong type of pasta. This kind said it has a serving of vegetables added to each cup of noodles. I was like oh shit that’s great. Then I broke down a bit because I have no one to share with this super stupid thing that happened to me. It was like that little spark of surprising happiness reminded me how alone I am right now. Holy shit what is up with that."
You Are a Trophy too Fellas,"For any guy that needs to hear this whether they are having troubles in dating or life in general. Just know that you are a trophy that is to be won as well.

Often many men will put beautiful they see/meet on a pedestal and act completely different from who they actually are, which only pushes them away. You wouldn’t change the game plan that got you to the championship, would you? Be yourself and know that you yourself are enough to shoulder your own happiness. Girlfriends aren’t meant to be your happiness, they are there to enhance it. You need to wake up everyday, look in the mirror and have the mentality of “you know what? I’m a F****** catch and anybody would be lucky to have me”. 

Adopt the mindset that your life is a long car ride, many people will hop in and hop out of your car but guess what? No matter what you are always the driver, never let anybody take you out of the drivers seat to your glory. If people want to get in? Make sure they are worth it. If they want to get out? All the power to you, this train will keep on rolling. 

Both parties in dating are trophies that both need to win each other. Or I suppose if you’re an Incredibles fan, if everybody is a trophy, nobody is, which also should take the edge off.

Good day to you all!"
Focus on becoming the right person - it makes sense why I’m still single,"I’m turning 26 this summer and I’ve never had a relationship. It may sound stupid, but I think it’s true what I hear, “stop trying to find the right person, and focus on becoming the right person”.  

I like to believe I’m a good person and I’ve made a lot of improvements over these past two years, but I still have a lot of work to do. 

I’m not exactly good looking, but I believe it’s my personality that others find unattractive.   
I have insecurities, self-worth issues and lack of confidence. I see people with worse issues than me who still manage to have a relationship and that would make me mad, but I have to stop comparing myself to others. And I can only imagine how any relationship I managed to find would turn out. 

If I’m not happy with myself how can I expect others to be happy with me? I can’t have the mindset that someone else will come along and make me happy, that’s a lot to put on one person. 

I hope to get to the point were I like/love myself, lead a healthy lifestyle and were I’m content going through life single. If someone comes along great, if not, no problem I’ll still be happy. 

Sorry if it’s a cheesy post, just felt like expressing my thoughts."
I actually told someone I wasn't feeling it instead of ghosting!,"Met this girl off of bumble and we talked for a while. She's in law school and works a part time job so she doesn't have a lot of time. She also wanted a serious relationship and right away I knew I couldn't do that because I like having a lot of time with whoever I'd be in a long term relationship with. 

I still talked to her just to get to know her and the more we chatted the more I realized she wasn't right for me but she wanted to plan a date. Normally in these situations I would just ghost because it's easier than having to let someone down but I decided to let her know I didn't see it working out. She hasn't replied back but I feel so much better actually saying how I felt rather than ghosting and leaving her to wonder where it went wrong."
"Choose yourself, not them","PSA to anyone who needs to hear this:

On the topic of waiting... 
On the topic of ""taking a break""...
On the topic of ""if it's meant to be, we'll happen again""...

Don't. 

Don't wait. Don't tell people you guys are taking a break. Don't hope that maybe after they're done fooling around they'll come back to you. 

Because if they fucked up, know that they messed it up, and STILL aren't coming around, then why do they deserve you? 

An anonymous note to my ex: I knew you weren't the one when you told me you missed me, told me I was the best thing you lost out on, and STILL didn't do anything to get me back. If you really thought those things you wouldn't be dating someone else right now. 

To whoever needs to hear this, choose YOURSELF before you choose the person you love. Don't disrespect yourself by letting someone know they can walk back into your life whenever they want. You deserve all the best in the world, not someone who doesn't appreciate you for who you are.

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the support on this post! ❤ I'm glad so many people were able to find comfort through my words and so many more shared their stories and talked with each other in the comments :) feels a bit more like Facebook than Reddit now but oh well haha"
I'm 28 and never dated. Where's the tutorial level?!?,"As the title states, I'm 28 going on 29 and dating was never really a part of my life as I tended to fall for girls who never reciprocated those feelings when I was much much younger. I stopped trying altogether when I left for college and I've gotten so used to being alone that I couldn't imagine myself wanting to be with someone else because being single felt so freeing. I thought I was happy on my own with my solitude.

This quarantine has proved that theory wrong in every way possible.

I know now that I WANT to be with someone, but I have exactly zero idea of how to actually make that happen.  This is further not helped by the fact that I'm a bigger guy with little confidence in most things, let alone dating. So any advice on what I can at least be doing to get started so I don't walk into instant failure would be more helpful than words can express."
Are we a load of single people giving each other advice on how to date...,"I love this sub and the advice, discussions and opinions on here. 
But I’m wondering if most the people on thus sub are single? 
I can’t help but think if you’re good at dating and successful you’re probably not going to be too interested in this sub. So are we just a load of single people who aren’t very good at dating giving each other advice?"
The stupid non-response game,"I [20M] am just fed up with the stupid game that people play when someone doesn't respond immediately. It's happened a few times where I'm talking with someone pretty regularly, snap back and for a few times in the morning and then I'll go on a run for an hour or two where I won't check my phone. 

Then, all of a sudden, it's just no responses to any questions, won't open msgs except for a day or two. 

Like people are busy, I get it if you're out busy doing stuff, but going back and forth to see who can avoid the other person for longer is stupidly destructive towards building any relationship ever."
Halloween is coming up...,"And I'm thinking I should dress up as ""legitimate emotional intimacy"" because that really seems to scare the shit outta people."
Most important character trait in a partner: The capacity for self reflection,"Honestly, out of all the things that terrify me, a partner who lacks the capacity and/or willingness to self reflect has to be at the tippy top. And people don't discuss it enough!

 If you don't know why you do shitty things... you're just going to keep doing them... But that’s only one part of the equation. 

if you're not brave enough to move away from you're current identity, to move into the unknown, to take steps towards self repair, you're going to remain in a ""woe is me"" complex forever. Being upset with your actions is not enough. Self pity is not enough... (Adlerian psychological theory covers this extensively) 

Say you cheated in a previous relationship, my biggest question would be, what did you take away from that? What did you learn about yourself. If you cheated due to low self esteem and a need for outside validation.... and you don't consciously know that... you're 100% going to be doing that shit again because you're flying with blinders on...

 You need to realize that your reactions to what's in front of you are often reactions to dredged up feelings from the past that are being resized to appear congruent to the present.

If you can't accept that you're wrong in certain situations. If you can't confront parts of yourself that are uncomfortable...parts that may be at odds with the idealistic image of yourself, if you're not open to the possibility of having your ego demolished and rebuilt, you're a hopeless cause. Stay single till you figure your shit out."
Taboo to give out number,"I was at Best buy and saw this guy with a hamburger backpack. I asked him if it was from Steven Universe, he responded ""Yeah!! Glad you made the connection"". I introduced myself and we started chatting. We had a lot of the same cartoon and anime interest. I was a lil shy so we ended conversation and he went back to work. My friend pushed the ideal of me giving my number to him. So, before he walked out the door I told him, Its rare when I find someone who likes Steven Universe and Gravity Falls. I gave him a card that I wrote my number on. I told him if he wanted to chat more that would be awesome. He smiled and said sure. 

If I like someone, I'll talk to them. My other friend thought it was crazy that I approached him and talk to him. I told her, I'm not going to sit and wait for some guy to talk to me... I'll die old and alone...fuck streotypes and that gender role crap..  If you like someone talk to them. Why is it so dam taboo for women to approach men and talk to them???"
"Found my dream girl, and it turns out it was just a dream","First time posting, not sure how this all works.

About 7 years ago I (29/M) met a girl I fell for super hard and she strung me along, used me, and eventually I found out she was engaged the entire time. This hurt me pretty badly to the point that I gave up on romance and just engaged in one night stands for a few years. I didn't want to get hurt again. Eventually I started ""dating"" people again, but never longer than a few months. I got into some ""relationships"" that I realize now I was only in just for the sake of having a relationship, and I couldn't give them the emotional reciprocity they were seeking. I know it's selfish of me, but that's just where I was.

Which brings me to the story at hand. About 6 months ago I matched with this girl on Hinge. We spoke for a little bit, but never wound up seeing each other. At least not at first. After a few months we started texting semi-regularly. She's a chef from Peru, and we have many common interests like music, traveling, and generally the same worldview. She's passionate, driven, has a kind heart, she's not world weary or overly cynical, and she makes me laugh. It doesn't hurt that she's beautiful either. Eventually I got her out on a date and we hit it off. Nothing too fancy, just some drinks. A few weeks later we went out again, going on a walk in the park that night. We kissed, held hands, all that stuff. We went out a few more times after that, each better than the last. We both felt very comfortable around each other, and I found myself falling for her. There was just one problem: she told me she was moving to Berlin to open up a restaurant with her boss/former coworker. Obviously that seems like a dealbreaker, but it just so happens I lived in Berlin for 2 years, went to school there. So instead of giving up on her I wrote her a little guide to help her get acquainted with the city and its customs, gave her some sites to check out, sent her some apartment hunting websites, etc. I never pretended like she wasn't leaving, but I guess in my fucked up little mind I thought, given my ties to the city, we might be able to work something out.

So last night we went out again, walked around, had some drinks. I asked her if I was going to see her again before she left and she told me she wasn't really looking for anything sentimental, that she had gotten out of a 3 year relationship with her ex last year and wasn't looking for anything. So, given that she was being honest with me, I was honest with her: I told her that I'd never met anyone like her before, that if she was going to any other city in the world I might not have brought it up, and that I was sure that she was going to achieve what she wanted in life more than anyone I've ever met. At this point she almost started crying, and she said was at a point where she was trying to learn how to be alone with herself before looking for a relationship, but she told me she thought I was really great and interesting, and she thanked me for never letting her feel stupid like her ex had made her feel and that she hoped we could still be friends because she found me really easy to talk to and I made her feel good, and that if I ever came back to Berlin she would want to see me. I didn't rule out the possibility of friendship in the future, but I told her I needed some space and that I couldn't see her again before she left, but I said that I didn't regret our time together and I wish her nothing but good things. She understood, so I walked her home and we kissed each other on the cheek before we said our goodbyes.

That was last night, and though it doesn't hurt as bad as I'd feared it might I'm still feeling pretty shitty. I deleted all my dating apps because I know I'm not going to be in any shape to date anyone for a while. She really was the girl of my dreams, and I'm not bitter about it, but that doesn't stop it hurting a bit. I guess if I got anything really great out of this it's that I learned that I could feel things I didn't know were possible, so maybe someday there's a chance I could feel it again? I dunno. Today's kind of a rough day.

Anyway, that's my rant."
Asked for some answers and got it... :-(,"A guy was giving me mixed signals so I straight up asked him what his intentions were and he told me “isn’t it obvious?” Blabla but eventually told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship but still wants to remain friends. After this whole convo, the next day he barely talked to me and our dynamics were different. Pretty sad about it but whatever! Entering the new year with some clarity! No to mixed signals in 2020!"
What I’ve learned from my first long term relationship: having a sexy partner is important,"Finding your partner sexy is really important. It’s also more of a personality trait than something physical. I think we downplay sexiness too much when it comes to serious relationships, but if your partner isn’t sexy to you at all, your sex life will suffer. I physically thought my partner was attractive, but he dressed terrible and wasn’t confident. This completely turned me off. It was to the point where I didn’t want to kiss him and we could barely even have sex because I was turned off. 

Then my next boyfriend, who I only dated for a few months, was sexy as hell. We were very exclusive, he was only into me, he didn’t play women, but he was confident and knew what he was doing and that people found him attractive. He said he loved my confidence as well. He also had bacne and some loose skin from losing weight, I don’t want you to think you need to be perfect to be sexy. 

While there is a physical component, it is mostly personality. Like if Jared Leto had the mentality that no one liked him and he was awkward and put me up on a pedestal, I wouldn’t be into it. I’m not into cockiness either, but you should both be confident. 

I feel like people don’t talk about this enough and I just wanted to share. I’m a woman with no ass, some skin problems, and thin hair, but I still bring that BDE."
Dating isn’t for the weak,"I don’t know if anyone needs to read this, but I had an interesting observation and in case if gives even one person the info they need, I thought I’d share. 

Dating is hard. Not talking about FWB or casual hookups but dating. Finding someone compatible and interesting enough to spend an evening with. Finding someone willing to fight at least as hard as you do when things get tough. Our time is valuable. Or it should be. 

So we try to get out there. Maybe bars. Maybe the deep dark abyss of the online marketplace. Maybe we join clubs or volunteer. And we don’t meet anyone that we connect with. Or we do, but it’s not reciprocated and in an era of instant gratification we find ourselves competing with greener grass that may not even exist. 

But here’s what I’ve noticed lately. 

As a 43 year old female, I’m noticing so many of the relationships around me. 

A same age friend just recently started a relationship with the man she has fallen in love with.  They originally met in high school but timing wasn’t right. 

Another friend found her forever partner eight years ago at age 35. 

Another friend ended a 12 year relationship where she hasn’t been happy for 11 years. 

Another just celebrated her 12th anniversary with the love of her life. She’s 42. He’s 44. 

Myself? I’ve been in a relationship for just over a year with a man who has shown me in so many ways why past relationships never worked. He’s everything I never thought possible. He is my anything but not my everything. We met online a week after I proclaimed to someone that my life is pretty amazing and someone’s going to have to be spectacular to be a part of it. He is. 

So I’m not saying you have to be mid 40’s to find the relationship you crave.... not at all. I’m saying that it took an awful lot of us 40+ years to truly figure out what we wanted and to find the courage to say no when our relationships fell short. In that time, we learned a lot about what we didn’t want. We learned a lot about ourselves. We built careers. We raised kids (some of us) and in the end, we allowed our journey to shape us without giving up hope for what we desired in life. A partner. In every sense of the word. 

Kudos to those who already have it all figured out. For everyone else, enjoy the journey."
Any other perpetual single ladies here who feel broken?,"I've been asking for a long time why I've never been in a relationship? Am I ugly? No I'm decently attractive and I've had various sexual encounters. Maybe I have a weird personality? But my friends all like me. Possibly I'm just unlucky, I don't know.

But I'd like some advice on how to meet a guy who is looking for a girl like me. I'm very compassionate, easy going, and adventurous. 

I've been at risk for abuse in dating because my standards at this point are very low. So I'm tired of that. Ideally I'd like to find someone worthy of me and my values. 

Any other women in the same boat?
Men, any advice?"
"I finally overcame my fear of physical intimacy. It might not seem like much, but it's a huge milestone for me","I went to the night club and got drunk. Some girl approached me. For once in my life I stopped overthinking it, and just lived the moment. We ended up kissing for a minute or something. It's not much, I know, and I didn't feel anything. But it's a huge milestone for me 

Thanks to everyone who encouraged me here to face my fears head on


EDIT: Oh man, this really blew up. Thanks for the kind words everyone!"
Is there actually guys out there who want to be in genuine love?,"I’m 28(F) and so tired of meeting guys who are lying assholes. I’m just mentally, emotionally overall giving up.

Is there anyone who want to be friends ^-^ I did not know so many are struggling.. heh. If yes u can PM me. ☺️"
Dating with terminal cancer - I am struggling.,"I am sure some of you read the title and thought, shouldn't there be more concerning things on your mind at this point? Dating seems like something not to worry about.

But see, the problem is I am not simply going to up and die in 3, 12, or even 24 months. Or at least I hope not. 

I am what they call, a long-term terminal, a palliative care, or a non-curable cancer patient.  I have cancer that has no cure, will require consistent treatment, impacts my life on a daily basis, and will lead to my death unless a cure comes along.  Just not anytime super soon.  I am still reasonably young (35 male), and was quite healthy before diagnosis meaning my prognosis for survival was good.  Whereas many with this cancer are around 35% over 5 years in terms of survival rate, my doctors estimated I had at least 15+ years, perhaps a lot longer, and that's an eternity in cancer research meaning perhaps I will transition from terminal to simply stable or cured one day. 

But because of this, my life is obviously very affected. I have health limitations which include limits with regards to exercise, diet, stress amounts, and more. I am classified disabled, despite not looking disabled, due to being limited in what I can do work-wise, and on SSDI because of it. I am chained to a location (at least for now) due to treatment and being a research patient (I hope helping others down the road). I live with my parents due to a combination of needing occasional help and my limited income. I am immunocompromised.

But most importantly I am aware enough to realize I am becoming more depressed by the day as I struggle to try and date.  I'll be honest, I was never great at it. I am shy and somewhat of an introvert and while I enjoy social interaction, I lose energy fast (even more so these days). I am certainly what women may call a bumbler when it comes to words and am terrible at reading signs. My confidence in the dating world is not really there even if I have it in other areas of life. Most of my past relationships (and there were only 4) were simply because we connected on a shared interest in art(oh yea I paint, draw, and write poetry as a serious hobby).

But since being diagnosed several years ago I have gone on a grand total of 1 date.  I am lonely. 

Before COVID it was frustrating but I focused on my hobbies, dreamed of better things, and kept putting myself out there with the realization that having what is effectively terminal cancer that would limit my lifespan would probably scare off many women. I realized I was not exactly a catch but I still tried. I was raised right by my parents, and my sisters were always very supportive, and I knew I had something to offer whichever wonderful woman took a shot on me. I knew I would do my best to make her happy whether the relationship lasted 1 week or the rest of my life.

But as time has passed it got harder to maintain a positive attitude. And now with COVID, that loneliness and struggle has suddenly hit me like a truck.

I don't know what to do. What was once difficult now seems impossible. I have something to offer. I am loyal, honest, upfront, willing to change. I try my hardest to be a good person, dream of simply making someone smile at the end of a hard day, or holding someone while they cry and offer support. I want to cuddle someone while we stream a horror movie, and cook them a carrot cake (my specialty) when they have a sweet tooth. I want to introduce them to my sisters and have them learn embarrassing stories from my youth. I want to paint them something just to show them what I can create and hopefully bring them joy. I want love. I want companionship. I want a life friend.

But for starters, I just want a date. A relationship. 

A hope for something more.

But I feel handcuffed by my health. Handcuffed by my mind. And now handcuffed by COVID.

I am posting this not just to seek out help, although advice would always be welcome, whether its suggestions of dating sites, recommendations for how to date in my situation, or ideas for new approaches to the dilemma.

No, I am also posting this because I want folks to understand that there are certainly others out there like me.  Realize how precious finding someone special can be. Realize that COVID is harder on some than others when it comes to dating. Realize that depression can be a real issue and to take a moment to consider others in this time.

I sit here at 12 am (here on the east coast), unable to sleep after a recent surgery and internal pain associated with it, and just hoping beyond hope I find myself lucky enough one day to find someone special. Even if it's just for a fleeting moment that can help bring a bit more hope back into my life.

Because that hope is sorely needed right now.

**Edit:** Thanks for all the support. I am trying to reply to everyone but apologize if I missed you. This blew up overnight. If you have any specific questions for me, I am a fairly open book although I may not answer everything for privacy reasons. And don't mind offering my own advice from my experiences if you need it, not that I have much in the way of dating advice to offer haha.

I also want to make it clear that I am not suicidal as I have gotten some concerned PM's. I am not afraid of death, and a part of me likely would welcome it, but I do not have a desire to die at this time. I could not put my family through such a thing, and life is still too interesting for me to leave it behind. I love learning and seeing the world. That doesn't mean I am not suffering from depression and I hope others realize that depression does not go hand and hand with suicide but can be no less dangerous and harmful.  Keep an eye on your friends and loved ones should they need mental/emotional support, especially in the time of COVID. Being aware is more important than ever."
"describe to me, what does it feel like to sleep next to someone you love?","I love reading people’s feelings towards the ones they love and I’ve been meaning to ask this question for a while so please tell me your stories, I’d love to read them all, it’s so cute. 

(I get really lonely at night so I wanna know what does it feel like to sleep with someone you love other than your dog) haha

Edit: I DID NOT expect to get this many comments but one thing I will say is that I LOVE every single one of you guys’ stories. I keep reading them over and over again. You all just gave me faith in humanity, knowing you appreciate small moments like these is just amazing."
Sometimes Being Alone Is Better,"I mean, seriously.  Having time to yourself to find out what's best for you and what's best for the person you want to be with in the future can be extremely therapeutic, even if only in hindsight.  My last (and only) girlfriend cheated on me before dumping me, and looking back on it I'm better off for it.  I got my mental state under control.  Took steps towards bettering my life and job.  I'm getting a new tattoo and looking at cars soon.  I also feel much more stable and like a better fit for someone BECAUSE of the time to improve myself.  You'll find one eventually, until then focus on yourself and bettering your situation."
"There is way too much ""woe is me"" complaining in this subreddit.","I subscribed because I thought there might be dating tips or a supportive community but it's a bunch of incels whining about how they can't get dates and how it's so much easier for women to date. The negativity is just getting me down. 

Peace."
Ghosting Girls,"Two times over the last couple months I have been ghosted by two separate girls. The first one, we only went on one date, and it was nice. We got a couple beers, had good conversation, and when saying goodbye, she was the one who first said, ""We should do this again sometime."" Of course I said yes, for sure! She was cute and nice, and i liked her. Texted for the next week or so, ghosted me once, and sent one last hail Mary,  just general like, ""Hey how's your week going"" to try and start a conversation and just completely ghosted. 

The second girl just recently, we were acquaintances through my sister, she was my sister's friend, she found me on bumble, and she began the conversation. We texted for a couple days, I got her number, kept on texting, until we set up a date to meet up. Date went great, she brought some beers, we went on a little hike, good conversation, we kissed the first date, which I normally don't do but it felt so natural. She bought me 16 tall cans of beer at this brewery she works at on the way out (Wife materail) and when we were texting later, she told me she wished I didn't leave so soon. We meet up again a week or so later, go out to dinner, she grabs my hand first while we are walking and we hold hands for the rest of the night. We come back to my house play some games, have a great time. Ends up staying the night (No sex, just other sfuff) get a little morning BJ, make some coffee for her, and kiss her goodbye. Bring her favorite juice to her while she's at work later that week, and she tells me I am the sweetest, and thanks me for being so nice to her. Sends me multiple texts with kiss emojis. 

Fast forward a couple days, we are still texting, little flirting, and one day just generally ask her how she's doing, and no response. I stay cool, give her a couple days, she's still sending me random snaps during this, but I text her again, she responds, but very short, i notice a disconnect. And then I text her just yesterday asking her if she wants to go to this bar she told me she really had been wanting to go to. No response. 

I get if she lost interest, but I am just literally wondering what I did, or didn't do, or if she is just going through something. Literally its like she just changed her mind overnight. Why say all these positive things about me, grab my hand first, ask me if she can stay the night, and just essentially redact all of it seemingly overnight. How hard is it to just respond, ""Hey I am busy tonight,"" or ,"" Hey, I just need some time."" I simply don't get it. 

Ghosting is the fucking worst, especially for someone with past anxiety and over thinking like me."
The signs you're ignoring in the beginning just end up being the reason you leave later.,"The title says it all. Also, listen to your family and your friend's advices. If they don't feel good about that person, maybe there is something wrong with that person that you don't see."
Some thoughts for guys on dating apps,"In light of the recent Match Group scandal, I think it's time for me to write up some guidelines for guys using dating apps. If you haven't heard, Match Group is an online dating company that owns just about every dating app you have ever heard of. They were accused by the FTC for creating fake profiles to entice users to purchase premium subscriptions. 

Here are some of my thoughts:

* If you've never had a girlfriend or had a woman show interest in you in real life, then forget about dating apps. I have never seen a guy with no success in real life with tons of matches on these apps unless he's catfishing hard. And if you're in a remote area without lots of people to meet IRL, then the apps won't work either because there won't be anyone on there. 

* Never, ever pay for these subscriptions or boosts or whatever they're called unless you already have tons of matches without purchasing them. These things almost NEVER work because the root of the problem is that you're not competitive enough (not attractive enough, not educated enough, not unique enough, etc.). Even if more people see your profile, you will just get more left swipes or get likes from people you wouldn't swipe right on anyways. 

* You need to understand the dating app business model. The longer they keep you on their platform, the higher the probability of you spending money, so it is NOT in their interest to actually match you with suitable people. When you have few matches or low quality matches, you get desperate, and every new match will give you a dopamine boost. They're capitalizing on that addiction. 

* You need to understand the vicious cycle of dating apps for men and women. Men swipe right on everything because they have low numbers of matches and want to maximize their chances. Women become more selective because they now have more choices, which leads to less matches for guys. And the circle goes round and round. Oh, and you also get penalized for swiping right on everyone. 

* Because women have lots of matches from the hordes of thirsty guys, they can leverage their position on these apps to seek validation, find someone to chat with, advertise their Instagram/Snapchat, or sell sex work. I think there was a survey that said the vast majority of women are NOT looking to date seriously on these apps, and they're just curious or bored. 

* For the love of God, don't turn into an incel just because you don't get matches online. I mean, you should never be an incel no matter what, but I see so many guys completely giving up on dating and blaming women because little Timmy only got three matches on his first day on Tinder. Seriously, for all the reasons I've listed above, these apps are NOT a true measure of your attractiveness because on these apps, only the most attractive men are perceived as attractive while guys below that super high threshold is perceived as unattractive. It's essentially a binary view of attractiveness, but attractiveness is more of a bell curve. 

* Dating apps promote convenience, but do they really? Sure, it takes no effort to swipe right on someone, but let's be rational here: what's the conversion rate from a swipe to a date? After the swipe, you have to match, you have to talk, you have to set up a date, and you have to actually go to the date. There can be tons of drop off at any point in that funnel, so when you consider all the effort you spent for that date, are you really better off than just asking in person? And you might say, ""well I'm an introvert and prefer online dating"", but that's not the right excuse. Being an introvert means you don't like to hang around people all the time and talk, but that doesn't mean you can't be confident and ask in real life. 

* A lot of guys turn to dating apps because they don't have many friends or a social circle but still want to date. Thus, the apps seem like their best option, but you need to ask yourself, ""Why don't you have lots of friends?"" Are you really busy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really shy? If so, how is dating gonna work? Are you really unlikable? If so, how is dating gonna work? Or let's talk about the best case scenario where you're a great guy, but you just moved to a new city and don't know anyone. In that case, you certainly should NOT prioritize dating over making friends because if you guys break up, then your social life is back to square one. 

What am I getting at here? Well, here's a metaphor: gambling is fun once in a while, but if you want to make a living, you probably shouldn't stay in the casino. These dating apps are essentially casinos where all the odds are against you and the chances of your success are as good as Jackie Chan not doing kung fu in a movie. I mean, there is now PHYSICAL proof that these companies are trying their best to screw your wallet, and even if they do remove the fake profiles, that's not going to help you one bit because the ecosystem on these apps is already fucked with hundreds of guys vying for one girl's attention, deluding her into thinking she looks like Arwen from LotR while deluding you into thinking you look like Gollum. Personally, I think these apps have done more harm than good on the dating world because they focused on the monetization of desperation rather than building a good product, and I would love to see them all destroyed in the fires of Mt. Doom. Middle Earth references aside, if you've used these apps for the last three months without achieving a single meet-up, then these apps are not for you.

Edit: It looks like a lot of people are asking for an alternative, so I'll provide some feedback here. 

* You need to ask people in real life. I think many guys are afraid of rejection or being called a ""creep"", and so they retreat to apps. When you start asking people out in real life, you may crash and burn, quite painfully, but if the apps aren't working out for you at all and you want a relationship, you need to try something else. To ask someone out in real life, it's probably easiest at a bar/club if you see someone giving you signs such as holding eye contact or smiling. Just strike up a conversation with her and feel her out as a person. If she seems like a cool person, then just ask her for her number. If she gives it to you, great. If she doesn't, say something playful and just leave her alone. Obviously, don't ask a woman if she's not giving you any signs at all. That rarely ends well. 

* Make female friends. Make female friends of your friends. Make female friends at your hobbies. Make female friends in general. You don't have to be attracted to them, but it never hurts to have a network that isn't a sausage fest. Women have women friends, and you bet some of them are single. You can ask your female friends to introduce you to their single friends, or they might even set you guys up without you even asking.

* Here's what I think about being called a creep. Women on Reddit love calling men creepy for approaching them, and this has led many guys to believe that they should never even talk to women. WRONG. Let me paint you a scenario that's actually creepy: a woman is talking with her friends and not minding anyone else, and you somehow shove yourself between her and her friends and say to her ""hey gorgeous, I've been looking at you all night"", and when she asks you to please leave her alone, you ignore that and just keep following her around. Yea, that's fucking creepy. If you can't see that, God help you. Most guys here ARE NOT like that. Most guys here are just a bit shy, a bit awkward, a bit inexperienced, and a bit insecure. I'm sure most of you would never do something like that. If you say ""hi"" to a woman and she immediately says ""ew creep"", that's not on you, that's on her. She's a crass and immature woman with no manners and not worth your time. There's probably a lot of women on Reddit that had poor experiences with being approached by men, either being harassed, stalked, groped, or whatever, so now they believe all men are like that. Don't let them poison your mind. I used to think that Reddit was right and that I should never approach women, but deep in my heart, I knew it was not true that no woman liked to be approached. I only used that as an excuse so that I would never have to approach someone and potentially get rejected. I mean, just ask yourself: for all the single women not on dating apps, how are they supposed to find relationships if no one ever approaches them? We still live in a society where men are expected to approach women rather than the other way around, so to conclude, approaching women is very, very normal.

* I want to thank /u/[Bacon_Square] for this one that I've completely forgotten: go somewhere where you shine. What does this mean? If you're good at sports, go play sports. If you're really funny or musically talented, perform at a show. If you're really smart and successful, go to conferences and give speeches. If you're passionate about anything, SHOW IT OFF. On a dating app, the only thing that separates you from the other guy is typically just your pictures. To a much less extent, your bio. For many people, they cannot really show their strengths in a 2D profile. Some of my bosses are the smartest and most successful guys I have ever met, but if they made a dating profile, I guarantee you they wouldn't get more than 5 matches. Why? Because they can't show off their strongest traits when the comparison criteria is pictures and attractiveness. You need to play to your strengths, and if apps are not bringing out the best in you, then you need to find that outlet. Why do a lot of people like celebrities? Because we all admire someone who stands at the peak of society (also because gold diggers). I'm not saying you have to be a celebrity to find a girlfriend, but do you see how making yourself stand out is really attractive? Not to mention you'll meet people similar to you at places where you frequent."
Attachment,"Sucks when you’re so attached to someone and you just can’t let go of the idea of how amazing it could’ve been with them.. but maybe it’s just not meant to be and both of you are just too different from each other. I’m drunk.





*edit* Holy shit I woke up to a bunch of notifications and realized I had posted something on here. Thank you for the kind messages everyone, I honestly feel better about everything now. I kinda feel sick from last night so I’ll reply to as many as I can later."
“Why is such a pretty girl still single?” Do you really think I’d still be on this app if I knew that? Tell me why such a generically handsome dude is still single? Let’s brainstorm together Brad,"Quite literally my least favorite question. What do you want me to say?
 “Well, my last bf cheated with my lesbian roommate. Now I’m ready to spend months on end swiping for the least disappointing dude I can find. So what are your hobbies?”"
How Not to Pick Up Girls.,"I'm a bartender in a small town. Two decently attractive girls come in and order their drinks. An hour or so later a guy comes in, orders, then starts to attempt to chat them up. They are uninterested, he doesn't get the hint. He goes to the bathroom, and while he's gone they zip-the-hell out of there.

Next day I get a call from the bartender that is opening. 

""Do you know the blonde girl that was sitting on x side of the bar?""

 ""Who?"" (I was napping)

""Some very attractive blonde girl was in the bar last night""

""I guess""

""Do you know her?""

""Nope""

""Well, if she comes in again there's an envelope under the register for them""

""Ok"" (Let me sleep)

So obviously what happened was, mister catch-a-hint brought a letter that morning. They steamed that shit open. Inside: 

""you two are the most beautiful girls I've ever seen blablabla next time you drink is on me"" *leaves 20$* for them.*

As deliciously cringe and cheesy-stupid as that is, he left the same kind of note to one of our neighbor bars about a different girl, on the same day!

We did get the letter to the girls, they laughed.

Moral of the story, take the L when it is handed to you nicely. Returning for the second round douch-o-rama, Not effective."
"""I don't want to just fuck, but I also don't want a relationship""","I mean, that's cool, I guess, but I don't buy it.

I do believe some people probably have healthy, functional, non-committed relationships. But, I also believe a lot of people (In my case, guys), who are looking for a non-committed relationship online are full of shit. 

Yesterday, I asked a guy what was he looking for after having talked for a bit, and he basically said that he wanted someone he could go to the movies with, eat out, go on dates and have sex,  but not dating seriously.

To me, this just strikes me as ""I want someone who will be in a pseudo relationship with me, but without any sort of emotional responsibility and commitment from my part"". 

&#x200B;

Obviously, after I discussed things with him, he threw in the ""I'm open to a serious relationship with the right person and if things go well between us"", which in my experience, is a complete lie. 

There's a huge difference for me between getting to know someone slowly and see where it goes vs. the pseudo relationship with no commitment these men want. 

I think this sentence is thrown out to reel you in, and make you think there's hope it will develop into something later, but it most likely never will. 

&#x200B;

If you are looking for a serious relationship, or actually getting to know people, don't fall for this bullshit. It leads nowhere. If a guy says he wants nothing serious, believe him. Even if he acts like he loves you, and takes you on dates. Even if you meet his family. When you ask him where this is going, or if he wants something more, he will deny everything and act like you are crazy, but will try to convince you to stay. 

State your needs and wants, don't settle for anything less. Don't think you'll change his mind, don't waste your time."
Texts like this hit me in the feels,"https://imgur.com/a/hCbQ7FP

I’m trying to date this woman.  We’ve been texting to set up a meeting for this weekend.  I texted her saying that I’d be fine doing something simple like lunch, because I just want to spend time being with her.  

She texted back reciprocating... and it made my heart do the thing.  We’re not “in a relationship” yet, but I’m excited to see where this goes.

Not a question.  Just a bit of a celebration that things are going well in the dating front.

edit; note to any ladies reading this.  if you want to make your man melt, call him 'meaningful'

edit.  we've been talking for a bit over a month.  we've had two in person dates so far, and things seem to click between us."
Please for the love of God. Dont waste peoples time like she did mine,"I met a girl online. Everything was great. She seemed perfect. We gamed together, she was beautiful, our personalities clicked. We text and called each other everyday and night. Like I'm saying I'd stay up to 2am on the phone with this girl when I gotta be for work at 6am. I was super into her but she lived 10 hours away. Well eventually i was like screw it and asked what she would say if i came and saw her and spent the week with her? She said yes that would be amazing. So I took a week off from work, book a hotel and drove 10 hours in the middle of the night to see her. Got there and soon as I saw her, everything just seemed right. We hugged and kissed and *cough cough* other things *cough* everything just seemed so natural. No shyness, no awkwardness. Just everything just seemed to fall into place. Yea till the little tidbit comes out about her having a fiancee and her being threated by another guy to drop me completely from her life otherwise he would tell her fiancee. So that's what she did. Told me about the fiancee and told me to leave and stay outta her life forever. ""I never loved you I only loved the things you did that he couldn't"". Kick in the balls eh? I gave so much effort, money and mostly I gave my time, like a lot of fucking time to this girl. Wasted just like that. For nothing. Like dont waste someone's time like that, cause not only did you waste my time while we were together, now you are wasting my time while I try to get over you. I thought she was perfect. She thought I was just something to fuck over. Dont waste peoples time like that."
Got over my fear and asked her out. Ended terribly,Decided to get over my fear of asking this girl i like out on a date. Just got new job and just graduated school so i have been feeling a little less depressed. When i asked her out she didn't even say anything she just rolled her eyes and walked away like i wasn't even worth her speaking to me. Funny thing is i don't even feel bad about it anymore. Her loss im a jet engine mechanic now and i am starting to redo my relationship with life. So thats good enough for me.
Being treated as a second option,"I (26F) went on a first date with a guy (26M) and it went well. We met at my old job and were just getting to know each other mostly on the date. We have similar interests and values, and he acted excited about hanging out again. We also were messaging pretty regularly before the date. 

We plan to hang out again a few days later and he is giving me signals he’s interested and excited about it. He agrees to hang out then immediately cancels saying he forgot he had plans. Then he stops initiating convos, so I try initiating more but he isn’t responding to any of my snaps and contributes the bare minimum to conversations 

And a week later posts an Instagram pic with a new girl. Like seriously? I know we didn’t have much invested but why act into me and then ignore me, and have the audacity to post that shit

I feel like at this point he’s just keeping his options open, otherwise he could’ve just told me wasn’t feeling it. Dating is shitty

TLDR; mixed signals, ghosting, and being treated as a second option can gtfo"
The girl I was seeing lived with my friends and I just saw her ex walk in when I was round for a sesh...,"Well, the title really says most of it. I met this girl at my friend's flat a few weekends ago and we really hit it off. She moved into the flat six months ago and I just got back to town so it was likely I'd be seeing her round either way but you know, I felt good about how our dates and night went, and also after we discussed where this was headed ('give it a go' basically, because we hit it off but have different personalities). I was supposed to meet her this week but she was 'busy' and then stopped replying to my texts (I sent one a few days ago saying hmu if you want to hang and another one today asking how she was). My friends then invited me round for a bong and drink tonight and I saw her briefly in the kitchen but it was sorta like, 'hi' and I was with my friends primarily anyway so it was all good, maybe I'll talk to her later. Then her ex rocked up, and he's a pretty cool dude and they're still 'friends' but they broke up six months ago. Cool. Anyway, long-story-short I had bongs and vented to my friends about love while the girl I thought I was seeing (quite possibly, this is a vent) banged her ex. No hard feelings though, except for the lack of communication lol that was kind of unnecessary."
Dating is like....,Dating is like looking both ways for traffic and seeing its safe to cross. You cross and then are hit by a cruise ship.
Lower Your Standards and Learn What Actually Matters,"I often see posts where people rant over really small things. A recent example was that post about ""good morning"" texts being a turn off. I think people need to realize and accept that nobody will ever be perfect. You'll never meet someone who checks all of your little boxes—and if you did, you probably wouldn't check all of theirs.

As Dan Savage is fond of saying, you won't find the ""one."" You should look for someone who is close to the one and round up.

A lot of this comes from the ""paradox of choice"" that is a hallmark of dating today. So many people here seem to throw in the towel at the slightest sign that a potential partner doesn't meet all of their requirements, because there are so many other people to ""try."" But ask any person in a happy, long term relationship, and they'll tell you there are things about their partner that irritate them. That's just how human relationships work.

My advice: figure out what actually matters to you. What are those things that are legitimate deal breakers? Accept that there will be some things about a potential partner that aren't exactly what you want. It's like buying a house: maybe you don't like kitchen counter tops, but everything else is great and you have a budget so you make it work."
Am I the only girl who doesn’t like tall guys?,"As someone who is 5’2”, I find guys over 6’ unattractive. It’s hard to kiss them, you can’t talk to them without looking up their nose, it’s just an uncomfortable situation. It seems like in my girl friend group, I am the only one who feels this way. There’s gotta be girls out there who want a nice, practical 5’9” or 5’8” right?!?

Edit: Also applies to guys shorter than 5’8”, was just trying to have a dramatic compromise for others. My personal preference is 5’4”-5’7”."
Don't be so quick to conclude that your single-hood is a testament to an inherent unlovable character flaw,"I just wanted to share something I've observed. I've observed a lot of couples and spent some time with people in marriages and relationships etc and I've noticed they are all just human beings, with amazing attributes but also with some pretty obvious flaws. When I come on here I see a lot of posts on this sub where we are all always asking what is wrong with us in an attempt to understand why we're single. But have you actually paid attention to people in relationships enough to come to the conclusion that you can't find love and therefore it must be because you're too flawed to?

As an example, I know a woman through my school's program that we're both in. She is driven, a great conversationalist, and very loving of her husband. All great qualities. But she also loves to whine and complain a lot. And we all whine and complain but I never knew anyone could be so negative until I met this lady. She has complained to me about people in the program, people she's had very little interaction with. She has proclaimed to me during her rants that she thinks everyone in the program is stupid and sh'e smarter than everyone (except me she said of course ;) ). She has purposefully come up to me and the first things she sad was ""Can you share some gossip with me about so and so?"". etc etc. Eventually I began panicking when she'd call and text and I'm glad we are not in touch anymore even though I wish her well.  These characteristics, being negative, complaining, looking down on people etc are humongous red flags, I'd honestly not be very happy dating someone like this let alone marrying them. Yet she is in a wonderful loving marriage with a man who absolutely adores her.

What seeing people like these in relationships has taught me is that a lot of us are single because we are unlucky in dating, and that's just it. when I see posts of people trying to extrapolate why, blaming physical attributes, trying to see their character flaws etc it makes me a little sad because it's self hating but also it's just not reflective of reality. You just have not found your person yet and that is ok. Let's be patient and graceful with ourselves in this process.

TL/DR: Instead of asking ""What's wrong with me"" let's start being more realistic and less self-loathing and just understand that a lot o what comprises successful dating is luck and chance."
"Guys, at least act like you've talked to a woman before","I've had two separate 27 year old men say the uncoolest shit ever to me, today alone. One was going on about how he had never been to second base and then asked me if I had ever been to second base. And the other guy saying that his parents frequently cock block him when he tries to have ""alone time with someone overnight"". 
Like everyone progresses at their own pace, I don't care that you've never touched a girls tits, but the amount which you've talked about it is really concerning. I don't care that you live with your parents, I do too, but I don't want to hear about how they cock block you, read the fucking tone of the convo. 

Just act like you have some chill, try to be a little smooth. You make yourselves seem pathetic when you really don't have to. You're voluntarily bringing up unnecessary information and presenting it in an embarrassing manner. Just chill."
"Guy (35M) I’m (26F) dating said he’s going travelling again in a few months and has decided he doesn’t want anything serious. I’m going to end things now, is this text ok?","Just for background, when we started dating he said he was finally feeling settled being back home and was looking for a relationship. Last night he told me he’s decided he actually wants to go travelling again in a few months so can’t get into anything serious anymore but still wants to see me. I did think about maybe just continuing things and seeing how it goes but decided that I am looking for something serious so that wouldn’t be a good idea. I’m about to send him this text, is it ok?

“Hey you. Thank you for coming last night, I had lots of fun and hope you did too. I’ve been thinking about our conversations yesterday and everything you said. Thank you for being honest with me about where your head’s at, I respect it a lot. I love your company but I don’t think I can put myself in a position where I develop feelings for someone then get hurt later on. I just can’t make myself available in that way when I know I’m looking for something more. I wish it could be different because I do like you but I don’t know what else to do. I’m sorry (name) :(“

EDIT: Updated the text based on your guys’ advice to the following: 

“Hey, thank you for coming last night, I had fun and hope you did too. I’ve been thinking about our conversations yesterday and everything you said. Thank you for being honest with me about where your head’s at, I respect it a lot. I love your company but I don’t think I can keep seeing you when I know that I’m looking for something more. I just can’t make myself available in that way. I wish it could be different because I do like you but I have to do what feels right for me.“

P.S. thank you for all of the reassurance, you guys are the best. This shit is HARD.

EDIT 2: Just sent the text...will update you guys with the response 😬

EDIT 3: His response “Hey (my name),  I hope you’ve had a good day. Yeah I was going to text you too. I thought about the situation too and I also don't think it's fair on you.  Sorry I'm just a bit all over the show,  obviously not ready for something serious it seems :/“

Well. This feels really lame. At least I got in first, I suppose. Just feels like a crappy response after I took so long figuring out what to say. Kind of feel like an idiot. Though I don’t really know what I expected him to say. Ah man.

EDIT 4: For those asking why it felt lame, I guess I just felt like he was trying to save face, but I could be wrong. Maybe I just expected him to respond with something more thoughtful, given he did lead me on into thinking he wanted a serious relationship. I wasn’t hoping he’d try convince me to stick around; my decision was made when I sent that text. I just felt like his response was kind of just “oh yeah, oopsie”. But he probably said all that needed to be said. I’m just tired of dating ok. Let me be pissed off a little haha.

EDIT 5: I responded saying “It’s ok, enjoy your weekend away (he’s going to a festival) and good luck with all of your travels” and he responded “You are a lovely girl, and please don’t think this had anything to do with you :) thank you xx”. Guess I just leave it there hey."
Are you ever intimidated by the accomplishments or lifestyle of a partner or date?,"I'm talking to someone who sort of intimidates me. Specifically I feel insecure when I compare myself to their accomplishments and lifestyle/background.

In a way I'm getting used to this but it still catches me off guard. I've tried to broach this subject on reddit before and in general the response has been ""Why would you be intimidated? Who cares."" 

I'm actually trying to find people who have felt insecure in the presence of a partner's accomplishments/lifestyle. If so how did you cope with it? How did you learn to manage a sense of insecurity and maybe move past it?"
Stood Up On First Date (Ever),"I (25M) have never been on a date. I'm overweight by a lot and although I'm working to change my life for the better I'm still nowhere what you'd call attractive because of my weight. I've been like that my whole life and because of this and a lifetime of bullying I have next to no self-esteem/confidence. As a result, I've never been on a date in my life. I've never had the confidence to put myself out there as I hated myself so much, I couldn't imagine someone liking me. 

Like I said I'm working on myself a lot and that includes mental health as well. I've recently started putting myself out there and exploring the dating world, online anyway. For the last 3 months I've been on all the apps, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, PoF, etc., but haven't had any biters that weren't malicious scammers. Until this week. 

On Bumble I found a girl who, as far as I could tell, incredible. Cute, works in my industry, same taste in comedy, sports, just a ton of stuff in common. And unbelievably, we matched! We messaged back and forth all week, first on Bumble then via text. Things were great. Because of the pandemic, we couldn't exactly go out to dinner, so I asked her if if shed be interested in having dinner over video chat. Again, she said yes! I couldn't believe it. I spent the night/next day prepping the space where I'd sit, setting up lights to make things look better and testing microphones and cameras. I even found a playlist of ambiance music you might hear in a nice restaurant to have slightly playing in the background. I had everything set. And when the time came.... nothing. 

I texted and asked if the time still worked for her. Nothing. I called to see if everything was okay. Nothing. I waited for an hour to go by before I finally gave up and ate my meal alone in my sad setup. Still haven't heard anything from her. 

I don't know if there's much of a point to this post, if not just a way for me to get my feelings out. I just don't know what could have changed in 24 hours to change her mind. I feel like such an idiot. I'm around family right now and all I can do is put on a smile and pretend like nothing happened even though I'm on the constant brink of tears. It feels like a huge smack in the face, a reminder that all the progress I've made ultimately means nothing. I hate myself as much as ever. I don't know why I put myself through this.

EDIT: I just want to sincerely thank everyone for their kind words and support. When I posted this, I had no idea it would get this kind of response, and honestly I just wrote it as a way of getting my feelings out. You have no idea the difference it’s made in my perspective. Thank you all so much."
This is how easy it is to fall for an attempted murderer on an online dating site. Here is how I survived.,"I'll cut right to the chase since one of my personal superpowers is having a short attention span: ask for your potential date's last name, then do your homework. It could save your life.

Now for the cautionary tale. I'm 34, I enjoy long walks on the beach, puppies, etc. I've been on and off dating sites for years because socializing can prove a nightmare for introverts like myself. I'm usually alone (no complaints here, but it definitely will not get you laid), and I have a 99% success rate for being completely unattracted to...most people.

Very recently I decided to try a new strategy: I scrolled through pages and pages of profiles focusing solely on user photographs and waited until, as George Costanza so delicately described: ""it moved."" Now, I'm not saying I waited for it to give a little *twitch* (just in case I lost some of you with that metaphor, we're talking about my naughty bits); I'd long since lost my patience with ""he's *kinda* hot I *guess*"" so I swipe right and ""maybe one day the four lonely hairs of his stache will join forces and blossom into a big beautiful beard....right? If I wait? Like, for a long time?"" Now I've swiped right twice with no plans on engaging either potential date in conversation. Shame on me.

This called for a new plan and it was a simple one at that: I left the chemical complexities to my hormones and only stopped scrolling when I felt the ""if I don't makeout with this person I'll die"" *movement* in my pants. Like a beachcomber looking for buried treasure, I let my crotch be the metal detector that would hopefully lead me to dat booty (for science!).

It worked! He's even hotter in person! Oh, and that accent. And what do we have here, is that...*chemistry?* Do we actually have chemistry?? *And* he has a j-o-b doing the cooooooooolest thing ever?? He laughs at my jokes, and he's tall and handsome and and...what's the catch?

Wait for it.

Our second date went even better: we talked for hours and lost track of time. How cool is that? I went from wondering if there were literal cobwebs in my attic (\*ahem...\*reference to my naughty bits again) to being one-half of two people who spoke at such length that they lost track of time! We spoke on the phone. We spoke in person. We spoke over skype. We texted during movies (and were duly chastised). We were utterly fascinated by each other (or so it seemed). Time flew by. ""Hi"" and ""bye"" became ""good morning"" and ""goodnight"". ""How was your day?"" turned into ""I miss you."" Before I could catch my breath we were texting from the can while in the same apartment (but not on the same can).

Were we in love? Wtf, am I a wizard? Can I read minds? No. I had to ask. Cher is all, ""if you wanna know how he really feels it's in his kiss"" - well it's not, which makes her a beautiful, ageless liar. When I broached the subject we both looked at each other and smiled all toothy and clumsy, nodding our mutual assent. We were in love. And yeah, I did put on ""Finally"" by Cece Peniston and did the arm wave in the bathroom.

It might as well have been etched in stone: I'd be saving my best version of the running man for our first anniversary.

Ten months, two rescue pets, and one tropical vacation later and I begin to notice a few things. Like that I'd never met his family or friends. Never ran into anyone he knew on the street. The people he did say he knew...didn't seem to know *him*. I'll be honest, the introvert in me threw a wild party at the thought of *never* having to attend any family or friend events - but it was to my detriment that i didn't ask any questions about it.

I began to notice he also had mood swings. Pretty unpredictable ones. ""But I'm a woman,"" I remember telling myself, ""we all but invented the mood swing as soon as we were legally allowed to invent things."" I talked to friends and family about it (bless their hearts *and* their bad advice), but all I got was ""you find something wrong with everyone you date"" and ""no one is perfect."" My favorite was, ""you know how men are."" Do I? Because I've known a few of them, and....then I shut my mouth because it was coming from my mother. She legit made me with her body. I'm the reason she'll always have hemorrhoids. If my mother said, ""Baby, I've been shitting rainbows since the 60s and *that* is how I keep my svelte figure."" I'd totally roll with it.

The longer we were together, the more bizarre he behaved. Unanswered questions began piling up. Why didn't I ask them? Because I didn't want to reprise my role as the person who couldn't get a date should my questions lead to a break-up. *Lame.*

Strange occurrences left a bad taste in my mouth, but since they didn't paint the loving picture I wanted to see, I willfully ignored them. Like that time (on my very first ever tropical vacation) that I got pulled in by the tide a bit too far out. You guessed it - I waved my arms and yelled his name like my house was on fire because dang it I was terrified...while he just stared at me. Didn't move. Just stared.

I'm not proud of my willful ignorance. In my defense I just really wanted that ""love of my life"" Eryka Badu promised. Except she was talking about hip hop, folks. It's so very okay for the love of your life to be hip hop.

Less than a year into our relationship and I'm half conscious in an ER after he'd beaten me bad enough to warrant two whole months in a wheelchair. He tried to choke me so many times that I'd actually lost count. I was the sad recipient of some next-level 80s-hardcore-style stomping on places you don't want to know about. And I'm not even telling you the disturbing parts. Whatever you're imagining to fill in the blanks - it was worse. It felt like I was in Silence of the Lambs. On a scale of one to ten, I was at ""it puts the lotion in the basket.""

By the end of that night I had one working arm that I used to drag myself out of our apartment to find someone to call an ambulance (of course he'd taken my phone - it wasn't his first rodeo). While everything that happened put some permanent cracks in my heart, it doesn't make my blood boil as much as this: before the ambulance arrived the cops came for a whole different reason and it had nothing to do with helping me. I thought they were there for me, so I called out to them...and they walked right past me to talk to my former partner.

Using 911 recordings I'd eventually piece together that he'd called them using my phone when I was on the floor - and told them a woman had broken into his apt. Yep. I was actually listening to the guy who said he loved me, the voice I ached to hear all day long, tell the police to search me for weapons

Now, you can't possibly know this, but I'm not a big person and my former partner is on the larger side of the larger side. I thought it was next to impossible for anyone to believe I could overpower someone that big...but my man was so smooth when he spoke to the cops that they searched me for firearms while I was laying on the floor with glass and blood in my hair (spoiler alert: all they found was chapstick...surprise!!!). Had someone not noticed that I was bleeding, there was a chance I'd have spent the night in jail covered in life-threatening injuries. I know you're probably thinking, ""no one would do that to a woman lying beat up on the floor."" But guess what the magic words are? ""Broads. Amirite?? You guys get it. We've all been there. Jesus H. *chicks these days.*..*""* That's all it took. Turns out it's not that uncommon for a perpetrator to be believed over an injured victim. A little research will give you more examples than you care to know about.

Those were probably the most corrupt and morally bankrupt law enforcement officers I've ever had the displeasure of meeting. Their behavior was so flagrantly disgraceful that I didn't even feel the need to play the race card while writing this story. It wasn't a racist act. Those cops were black, brown, white and there was even a ginger. It well surpassed racism on its way to making a complete mockery of everything we consider humane as a *people.* Was it sexist? The officers who wouldn't move the ambulance for almost an hour (because they were still searching me and openly admitted that they weren't sure if they were going to arrest me yet- which is a funny way to answer the question:""Will anyone help me? I need medical attention, I can't breathe"") were all women. 

That's how easy it is for one smooth talking man to fool almost ten professionals. After forty or so minutes they were all still kinda undecided.

When it was all over, naturally I stopped taking his calls - so he threatened to call my friends, family, and former employers to tell them ""what kind of person"" I am. And he did just that. After receiving ""gifts"" from addresses I wasn't familiar with, flowers addressed to me but signed with fake names, phone calls from unknown numbers - I got a restraining order.

He got one that imitated mine two hours later.

So I made a harassment complaint. We now have a matching set.

*This is out of control, why does he keep copying me?? How is he legally ALLOWED to do this?* Well, if the state is suing you for a crime and *you sue the victim for the exact same crime*...the state withdraws its lawsuit.

Why not just drop the whole thing, chalk it up to experience, change my name, and move? I want to. I want to so bad. But I found out he did this to other people (one of whom left the country to get away from him- I wish I was kidding) and he might just keep doing it until he kills somebody (if he hasn't already). I'll be DAMNED if I don't fight the hardest I possibly can so *at the very least* I can get his name put on the domestic violence registry...

...because frankly his penis is too small to make the sex offender registry (zing!). Give it up for comedy folks, it gets people through the hard times. Can I get an amen?

No matter what race, gender, or sexuality - these predators exist. Keep yourself safe and verify their information before meeting anyone from an online dating site. Behind every name on those domestic violence and sex offender registries is a victim who fought back. They showed up at every court hearing, just like I am, so that at the very least *no one else* has to get hurt.

I'd like to be the last. In this case anyway."
Why I like being single,"Yes, I know this is a dating subreddit, but I figured it might help to share the view from the other side.  (I should probably mention that I'm ASD (formerly Asperger's), so my perspective is different from the norm.  YMMV.)

There's a lot to romantic relationships.  Stages, timings, things you should or should not do or say, etc.  Being single means I don't have to worry about or keep track of any of those.  There's the darker side of relationships--manipulation, abuse, cheating, divorce--that I completely avoid.  There's also the perils of dating that I avoid--getting ghosted, getting stood up, being led on, being used, and being stalked or worse.  Being single means that I'm the only one driving, and have full control over how I spend my time and money.  Finally, there's a strong sense of security and stability when you are the only factor in your life.

While I'm sure that ""the right one is out there,"" the cost and risk associated with being in a romantic relationship just isn't worth it for me.  Maybe I'll bump into someone who'll make me reconsider, maybe I'll be one of the lucky few who find ""the one.""  Until then, I have a career to pursue, a house to  buy, competitions to win, a furbaby to raise, and a host of video games to play (so psyched for Cyberpunk!).

TLDR; Being single isn't a curse.  Just like being in a relationship, it has it's own pros and cons.  You can prefer one over the other, and still be happy in both.

&#x200B;

Be kind to each other, tip your waiters, learn to love yourself as you are (not how other people may or may not see you)."
You guys I did it,"I finally asked out a girl I like. For the first time in my 27 years of being alive I had the guts and just asked her. I have known her for a while and think she likes me as well and after weeks of consideration and making excuses, I just typed the text into my phone, set a one minute timer on my watch and hit send the second it hit zero. I know text isn't the preferred way, but this is a huge step for me. 

&#x200B;

My heart is still racing and I have no reply yet, but I will report back :)

UPDATE: well this certainly blew up. Sorry for the late Update, but I was sleeping/at work. So far I got no reply. She often takes days to reply to my/her friends texts, but I figured she‘ll make an exception for getting aksed out, so I will take it as a no for now.
Thanks for rooting for me tho, really made my day a bit better"
"PSA: if you’re obsessing over how long it’s taking him/her to text you back or hang out, it’s time to drop him/her","Let me explain to you guys a revelation that I had in the last 24 hours.

Yesterday I posted about my unhealthy obsession with how long it was taking for the guy Im dating to text me back (every 4-5 hours). But I never sat there and thought : WHY am I exhibiting these behaviors? And then another thought came to me... why am I paying so much attention to MY behavior and not HIS?


I was making excuses for him. He’s really busy at work. He’s taking a nap. He’s out with his friends. Which are all valid excuses. But the weren’t why he wasn’t texting me back. He’s just NOT that into me. 


Here’s the thing. We’re all pretty smart. We KNOW what interest looks like. When we start obsessing over someone’s texting/calling patterns and how often they ask us to hang out, it’s because they haven’t been making their interest clear. And with that uncertainty comes the unhealthy, obsessive thinking.

I’ve dated plenty of guys and I know that the ones who are truly interested won’t go a day without texting or calling. They won’t say they’re not ready for a relationship “just yet” when you’ve already been dating for months. Because any person who’s truly interested in you and sees the amazing human being that you are would be so incredibly excited to take you off the market. 

I’m coming to the conclusion that this guy is just not that into me. And I’m going to be strong enough to not message him anymore because I respect myself too much to just be texted or called whenever he feels like it. 

And with that revelation and decision, I realized how much anxiety I’ve been harboring over his behavior for the last 5 days. 

Im intelligent
I’m resilient 
I’m kind
I’m loving 

And I’m no longer waiting for that text to validate me. And that makes me feel free.



EDIT: for the people calling me clingy and telling me to chill out. I’m merely speaking from my own experience with this one particular guy I’ve been dating for two months. He went from texting me every hour or so and calling me every night to texting back every 4-5 hours and not calling and not texting at all during the weekends. While still saying he’s interested but not ready for a relationship “just yet”. But would introduce me to his friends as “his girl”.

A lot of mixed signals. And I’m not willing to deal with it anymore."
People I'm attracted to don't want me. People I'm not attracted to want to marry me.,"I don't know what I did in my past life to deserve this foolishness.

For some unknown reason, I seem to have  very specific ""types"" for men and women. Both of these types make my heart flutter and my knees weak. Both of these types also prefer the LITERAL OPPOSITE of me. I wish I was exaggerating. Not only are they not attracted to me; I'm the polar contrast of what they're into. This has been the case every single time.

However, other people seem to have me as their exact type. This would make me happy as a clam if I felt even the slightest hint of attraction for them. I couldn't date or sleep with them if I tried because there really is no desire on my end. 

Can anyone else relate to this? Feeling like I'm pretty much destined to be alone."
"I asked him out a second time, got rejected.... no regrets!","So.. my friend introduced me to his friend earlier this year.

He pinged my DM while I was out of town last month telling me he hadn't seen me in a while and asking if I wanted to catch up sometime. So when I got back, I asked him out to lunch (I'd previously thought he was cute). We ended up having to reschedule to Friday dinner last week, and it was fun - we even went for a few drinks afterwards and I liked a lot of things I learned about him. Unfortunately, he didn't text me much afterwards. Then I got an invite to a Halloween event and was told to bring a date. I pulled together my nerves and asked him if he was free this Saturday night. He said he was free, so I asked if he wanted to my plus one to this thing. He responded saying he had just confirmed on other plans. Ah. Last minute alternative plans. His gentle way of saying no, because let's be real - if someone likes you, they'll prioritize you. To be honest, it stings and my pride took a beating because I was so accustomed to always being the one asked out. But I honestly have no regrets. This was my first time ever asking a guy out. Ultimately it didn't end up great, but I finally understood how it felt to go after someone you wanted versus debating on whether you were attracted enough to someone that wanted you. And it actually didn't feel too bad.

Moral of story: Girls, if you've thought about asking a guy out first but never given it a shot, give it a shot. I won't lie, it's not completely painless. But it gives you a new perspective on how tough it is for a guy when they ask you out and get rejected, you learn to appreciate more the guys that do gather up the guts to ask you out, and it's also really refreshing to actually try going after someone you want.

Edit: Holy cow, wow this blew up. Thanks for the silver! I've been reading all the comments and I've noticed there are a few comments that suggest that I might be jumping to things in regard to his response. I'll respond to some of those comments below, but for the record I still do think that it was a rejection -  if it wasn't, hopefully this will show some of you guys the variety of answers that a girl will take as a rejection and prevent you from rejecting a girl if you don't mean to! If there's ever an unexpected update to this post though, I'll make sure to put up a follow-up post. But I'm glad that this post got some attention :) hopefully it'll get this to the top of the news feed for some more girls to be encouraged to make the first move!"
Please please take no for an answer.,"I went out with someone on a virtual FaceTime date. He was not my type at all, but I had a good conversation with him for like two hours, then ended. Told him immediately after that I wasn't interested in being romantic, but maybe we could be friends. He says he's not interested in that and asks for another chance. I say no, talk to him about it, and then he accepts...

...Until I wake up to a three-page text message from him asking for me to give him a shot, how I deserve his love, etc. I finally just coldly say I'm not interested and block his number. I am 26 and he is 30 so it's not like we were fucking 16, where that kind of behavior is more normal!!!!

I feel so creeped out and nervous I ~~got a stalker!!!!~~ **will have a stalker based on his behavior.** Anyone dating, please take no for an answer the first time!!!! ESPECIALLY if you're out of college, you should know better. If someone says no, accept it. You won't change their mind, and if they want to be with you, they'll fucking message you!!!!

**Edit:** Getting a lot of responses, including DMs from angry men. Chill out, stop sending me stuff about how I'm so awful, and go outside. Here are some things.

**Dating Time:** Some guys are saying that I ""shouldn't have given him so much time."" My rule with first dates is to always give the person two hours, in case they're nervous, it takes us some time to get our legs, etc.

A lot of guys have messaged me to say that that's not okay, I should know immediately. Uh, **do you get mad at guys who fuck girls on the first date and then ignore them after? No, you don't, and why is that?**

If you're upset that someone would talk to you more on a FIRST DATE to make certain that you're not a good fit, **you are not ready to date people.**

**Attitudes: I've been rejected plenty of times when dating.** It doesn't matter who you are or what you look like. Sometimes, the person doesn't feel chemistry, they liked you but didn't like X or Y, etc. When I was 24, I was severely underweight due to an ED, and a lot of guys I met stopped finding my body attractive. If you are not ready to experience rejection, **you are not ready to date people.**

**The Guy:** He was attractive enough in pictures and over video, but something about him put me off. He seemed to develop romantic obsessions with girls and also mentioned he had a personality disorder and was going off of his meds because he didn't think he needed them any longer. I offered friendship and a clear no after for safety, because I didn't want to offend him and risk my own personal safety. Anyway, I wasn't intellectually or emotionally connecting with him, and I wasn't attracted enough to want to have sex (not that I do that.) Something about him was so creepy.

**Accepting ""No"" For an Answer:** When I broke up with my last boyfriend, he wrote me a long e-mail asking me to stay. That was fine, as we'd been in a long relationship, and I responded. On first dates, you're just getting to know someone. You should accept what the other person wants. Ours was a first date and a video chat, and I told him that I didn't feel romantic interest in him immediately after our date. He didn't accept it, so I even took the time to tell him over the phone the specific reasons I did not want to date him. He didn't accept it again, so I gave him a briefer ""no."" After that, he sent me a letter expressing that he deserved a chance.

**Contents of the Letter:** The only reason I am sending it over DM is because I don't want him to somehow find this post (slim chance, but weirder things have happened!) In the letter, he told me that while he didn't ""need my love"" and had ""plenty of options,"" I should give him a chance because I said I was attracted to him (I did not) and because he felt we had a connection. I should give him the chance **of a relationship** because he thought I was special, and because I am young enough so that my time doesn't matter/I can afford to go out with people I'm not sure about.

**Freedom to send the letter:** I would never show anyone the letter my last boyfriend sent me, because we were in a relationship. If someone I'd been dating for six months sent me the letter, I would not either. If you're going to send a letter that creepy and controlling to someone you **barely know**, you are taking the risk that other people, including police officers and therapists, will see it. **You are also probably not ready to date people.**

**Rejection:**

# As a final note, all of these angry messages have been about how I made him feel bad, and how terrible I am for it. Well, did you even consider how he made me feel? Did you? This was not a good or fun experience for me.

# I feel nervous and upset, and scared about re-entering the world of online dating. I feel nervous about meeting people in person, I feel nervous about saying ""no"" openly albeit politely again, and I feel like my choices won't matter to people I'm going out with.

If YOU don't care about the feelings of girls you're going out with, **you are 100% not ready to date people.**"
A little effort goes a long way,"Guys, if you really want to stand out to girls, but some effort into your dates. Actually plan something out. 

I met this girl that’s definitely out of my league on tinder a few weeks ago, talked for a while, and eventually decided it was time to actually go on a date. It was (almost) horrible. We just went to her favorite restaurant and planned for a movie afterward. The conversation was too good and we ended up replacing the movie with pie. 

Cut to the second date, tried for dinner and a movie again. Went to a new restaurant in town, the food wasn’t great  and we agreed on a movie. We went and got our candy to sneak into the theater and saw Fantasy Island. 

The third date, earlier this week, I was over the “dinner and movie” plan. She told me her nights off and I went to work, looking up cooking classes, ice skating, painting classes, all of it. I finally decided on a painting class and signed us up. I told her it was a surprise and only told her to wear short sleeves. 

I met up with her a half hour before the class and started taking a walk away from the studio, talking about her likes and dislikes, how she felt about surprises, etc. We basically walked in a giant circle and ended up at the studio that was right next to date #1’s restaurant. She believed that all the work was just for a reservation at the restaurant again before I took an early right into the studio. We had fun and are just waiting on the call for our work to be ready. 

We had dinner afterwards and she told me she had never had anyone put in the effort that I had put in to surprise her and have fun with her. She was impressed that I even made the effort to find something in our small town on a random Thursday night. 

TL;DR - made a reservation at a painting studio, surprised her with it, had fun, had dinner, she told me that no one had ever put in the effort that I did for her.

Edit: for those of you saying it’s a one way street. After the first date the “almost horrible” part was that earlier that day, my card information was stolen and my card was declined. She ended up paying for that night and still quickly agreed to a second date."
Five Signs That You’re Unapproachable,"Here’s the simple truth. If you’re not projecting an air of approachability, you’re going to fail with women. Unfortunately, most women view a majority of men as being absolutely unapproachable. Read on and I’ll tell you the five biggest reasons why!  


 **1. Not smiling** :  

If you see a woman scowling, does it make you want to approach her? Probably not, as you already get the idea that she’s in a bad mood. 

**2. Avoiding eye contact :**  

Eye contact is the universal signal that you’re into someone. So if we’re looking over in your direction but you never lock eyes with us, then it’s much less likely we’ll approach you. 

**3. Closed body language:** 

The more closed off your body language, the more unapproachable you seem. It might be crossing your arms or legs. Or keeping your hands in your pockets.

**4. Not having fun:** 

This one is mainly relevant if you’re in a social environment e.g. a bar or a party. We’ll naturally gravitate to the men who are clearly having the most fun. Why?

**5. Looking busy:**

We’re socially conditioned to not want to interrupt people who are busy. But most of us these days are doing things to keep from being bored — which also makes us look unapproachable.  


Thanks."
Why do guys just ask for sex on tinder :,"1- some girls say yes

2- why would you invest time and energy in a stranger from the online where there is so much abundance? Women follow the same logic on OLD btw. 

3- small talking gets you ghosted most of the time

4- being polite but straightforward and ask for a date gets you ghosted most of the time

5- Basically anything gets you ghosted most of the time anyways. 

Here is the thing. Most girls don't use tinder to meet guys (tinder official stats, not me making that up). So guys invest less and less and less energy into trying to talk. 

Who's left behind? Those who genuinely want to meet someone and go through trying to know others. 

It's a downward spiral. ❤️"
Would you use a dating app if you couldn't see what the other people looked like until you spoke with them for X amount of time?,"To keep this brief, I am a developer who thought it could maybe be cool & less superficial (especially in this climate) if I made an dating app that wouldn't allow you to see who you are talking to until X amount of messages.

Would you use something like this?

Here are the problems I think I'm solving

* Lots of matches on Tinder will never send each other a message, this platform by it's nature is designed to get people talking
* The current apps in the market are inherently superficial and affecting the way we see/value ourselves, I think that you might meet someone you really like that you might otherwise have never considered.
* Giving people the privacy of not having their pictures appear on a dating platform until you've had enough conversation with someone; don't like someone? stop replying and your identity remains anonymous.

Excited to hear your feedback :)"
I (F24) gave my number to a guy!,"This was the first time I’ve ever done this! I usually let guys approach me in public, but I remember how my fellow reddit men say they women don’t approach that often, and that it makes them feel appreciated. I put on my big girl panties and went for it! he took my number and we chatted for a bit at the place, my friend told me he was staring at me from across the way when I wasn’t looking. Even when we were leaving, he called me Over and told me I was really beautiful 🥰
Will he text me? Who knows, but I’m glad I put myself out there, the ball is in his court now."
I’m so burnt out from dating. Why can’t I just be in a relationship without all the bullshit?,It’s so exhausting. Finding someone to commit to anything seems impossible. I’m so done. I’m over it. I fucking hate humans right now.
"As cliche as this sounds, you are absolutely enough and please don't forget that in your dating journeys.","I know this has been probably said to eternity on this sub as well as countless others, but I've been thinking so hard about that phrase recently. I'm 28 and a woman, going through my own single journey and putting myself out there. I've been rejected and hurt over the last 12 years. So much so that I stayed at home during much of my early 20's because I was afraid of rejection. I've gained weight, lost weight, had a gang of cystic acne then it cleared, then I got it again, you get the point. I've also gone through periods of therapy and a few medical issues I needed sorting. 

All in all, it left me deflated. I ended up developing this consistent running anti-mantra in my mind every time I saw an attractive guy in public: *he's married or has a girlfriend, iceskatingjupiter, no way would he be interested in you.* Every time. No matter how illogical or off base it was. I basically developed a really toxic mindset about myself, that I wasn't good enough and there was no point to dating because no one could possibly want to date me. 

It was one of the lowest points in my life. With all of that, I started to work on myself a year ago and get healthy in my mind and body. Nevertheless, I kept wondering whether or not I was *actually ready* to date. I read a lot of advice on here to wait until you have a fulfilled life with hobbies and a good career outside of a relationship before even considering to date, and I internalized that advice. 

It's very sound advice, but I'm wanting to challenge that a bit in 2020. Things are very up in the air for me. I'm between careers, possibly going to grad school, still working on my mental health and everything in between. I agree that waiting to date if you're going through some severe troubles or toxic mindsets would be very helpful. However, I think it would also serve us all to not wait until we have our dream lives to date. You are absolutely enough. You can wait or you can date, it's up to you. As I've realized, my anxiety and depression, while currently moderate, is a lifelong battle. I may never be the weight or size I really want to be. My cystic acne could come back at any change in my diet or medication. These are things that are very hard to control, but I'm sick of waiting. I spent over a decade feeling shitty because of all these things. 

You're enough. You can always dip your toe in, see what's out there. If it's not for you, great. Take some time off, explore a little, stay cozy at home until you're ready again."
Swipe on your opposite-gendered friend's account,"Me (23F) and my best friend (23M) were chilling and swiping on tinder and decided to swap phones and see what happened. 

And we both learned a lot. 

He swiped right on a lot of guys that I normally swipe left on...and in the following days I learned that a bunch of them were actually super cool, leading me to resolve to be less picky in the future. Also learned that there were some guys that I should just keep trusting my gut and swipe left on. (after about the third creepy message that I got in a short period, my friend says ""damn why do guys feel like they can talk to you that way? That sucks"") 

I also learned that you can run out of likes, which I didn't know before haha. 

I would judge my friend and I pretty similar in terms of looks and datability. However I found that a LOT more women were ""swipable"" than I have experienced with men. Asking the question ""would this woman be cute and interesting enough to date my best friend?"" meant that a lot of women made the cut, which was interesting to me. 

Last thing I learned was how genuinely shitty it feels to use up all your likes and only get one match. He told me that it was something of a miracle that I even got that single match for him. 

I feel like a lot of guys complain about this (especially on this sub) and girls roll their eyes like ""boo hoo, just have some confidence."" Or the classic, be attractive, don't be unnattractive. But he's a good looking guy, tall, with a solid job and cool hobbies. He doesn't spend a lot of time with OLD because he's usually dating someone. I thought he'd be getting at least a portion of the matches I was. But no. And damn it felt bad (even though I did know that they weren't not-swiping on me). 

Anyways those were my observations and I found it really interesting, and thought you guys might as well. Next time I need a reality check, I'll definitely be asking him to switch phones again haha."
"Can we adress the disconnect between ""Guys only want sex/I can't find relationship/I only get messages and go on dates from creepy guys"" and ""hey! I'm a guy and I can barely get a response""","title says its all. yeah, I realize there is a disconnect - that does not suprise me. what suprises me is the fact that both sexes seem utterly confused as to why the other has these problems.  

why the hell is there this disconnect? why do I get the impression that so many women truly believe that they are going to be alone forever because ""guys only want sex, I only get creepy guys"", yet, at the same time, men are pulling their hairs out because they biggest frustration they have is feeling like they are never going to find someone to grow old with because they cant even get a message returned. 

&#x200B;

So, where does the disconnect lay? is it because only the people that have issues complain and we don't hear about the successes as much? is it because the guys that do want relationships are not wanted by the girls that also want relationships, and vice versa?"
Does anyone else find dating to be exhausting and potentially psychologically harmful?,"You hear it all the time:

When you are interested in someone, you can't show too much interest. You have to make time for other things and show them you are too busy for them. You shouldn't make yourself not too available and keep your options open. You are basically told to play all these crazy mind games on a potential significant other. 

Personally, I have spent time going on many dates that go nowhere because both parties are too busy playing this ridiculous mind game. At some point, both parties give up because we both assume we lost interest in one another. It seems just like an endless cycle of dating people for a few months and then moving on to the next one. 

I also feel like this situation has not only affected my self esteem but also my sanity, in a way."
Today's disposable dating culture,"I'm a pretty open minded and modern guy [M32]. Or so I thought. But since I've been dating for the past year or so I've realized I actually got pretty conservative views about dating and relationships. Maybe I cause a shit storm with this one, maybe not. 

From my experience,  the dating game today shuns commitment and encourages disposability: if this one doesn't feel good there's always next, and the next, and the..

I've for example met a woman my age who had never been in a real relationship. To be honest, I wouldn't want to be her first partner, knowing how much there is to learn in order to build a working relationship. 

I've gone through a 8 year relationship, the breakup (3 years ago) and the following anguish. Looking back, it was one of the best thing that ever happened to me.  Learned so much about myself and now I know how important it is to put effort into a relationship, in order to build it strong.

What I am coming at is that many people are so into the disposable dating culture that they've forgot (or never even known) that a real, deep relationship takes a lot of work. And the work never really stops. Yet for this exact same reason it is so much more fulfilling than those one month going-out-but-never-really-getting-to-know-you-cuz-I-just-want-to-have-fun. To me this communicates insecurity and fear of commitment.

I feel like this is one major reason why people are so disconnected from each other and themselves. A proper relationship, which by definition always ends in tears (either death or break up), will teach the partners much about themselves and each other. It won't be easy, but in the end it will either be helluva lot better than being alone or it'll be another valuable, yet painfull life lesson. No commitment = no stakes = no winnings. A bit shaky metaphor, but you get my point.

How do you feel about this? Do you believe in keeping your options open and dating with low maintenance or would you rather put mutual effort into it and see if something long lasting can be born out of it? Why?"
Huge tip for people who don’t seem to ever attract interest from people,"I’m soon to be 22 (M) and I’ve always gone into social situations the same way every single time until a couple of months ago. I always used to get barely any attention from girls at all no matter the situation and I’ve only just worked out one of the huge mistakes I’ve been making for years. 

Every single time I used to meet up with people, I would always have this mindset that I was interested in a girl and wanted to go out of my way to talk to them. Every time I socialised, my primary focus was on a girl. I’m a fairly awkward guy, conversation and normal shit doesn’t flow great most of the time and flirting ain’t easy. I’d leave every social event/situation depressed and upset that nothing happened between me and whoever the girl was. Recently, I’ve been going out and actually enjoying myself. Forgetting about the fact there may be a girl I’m attracted to there. Being around people is so much easier now that my main goal for the night is simply to have a good time with no agenda, and surprise surprise, I’m getting some interest from girls now. 

Moral of the story is, I don’t give a fuck how long you’ve been single for. The only people that do are family members. I was single for 5 years, longer when you consider the only relationship before that 5 years was a month long. Go out and have fun with your friends. Doesn’t have to be a club either, just have fun whatever you’re doing. Forget about girls. It seems counter intuitive but think about what they’re seeing. The weird guy sitting in the corner looking nervous or the guy having a good time, laughing, smiling, you get the picture. Go and have a good time guys. You’ll start to enjoy life a lot more and maybe get a bit of interest. 

Good luck and I hope this helps some people. My DMs are always open"
Dating apps are exhausting,"Started taking my dating life seriously and man, I’m tired. So many baseless conversations. “How’s quarantine been for you?” over and over and over again gosh. I just need my partner to miraculously appear and take me out of this misery."
Does anyone else get the irrational feeling that they will never find mutual love again after a breakup?,"I broke up with my GF a couple months ago and every once and awhile I get this sense of despair that I will never find anyone else who would have romantic feelings for me and vice-versa. Anyone else get this feeling? If so, how long did it last for you?

Edit: Wow this blew up, Thank you all for providing your different insights and I wish the best for all of you :)"
Men: what are your biggest frustrations with dating?,"Hey,

what are your biggest dating frustrations?

For me it was that Im introverted and had problems to communicate with girls. Also i had a lack of self confidence.

Really excited to hear about your experiences."
Why isn’t online speed dating more popular?,"I feel like online speed dating should have become more popular, especially during these times. However, I don’t see any apps or sites which do this at the scale of other dating apps. There are several advantages with a video speed date-
1. You can’t catfish 
2. With a 2-3 min interaction, you can atleast filter out people you can’t stand
3. You spend way less time overall - no swiping, messaging folks part interested. You could still have that while following up with someone after a speed date, but such cases should be less.

I’m surprised Tinder/Bumble haven’t jumped on this already - they could rebrand it if speed dating is seen as something from the past. I know the league does it, but their CX is crap tbh. And the local speed dating events are just not good enough - they don’t have enough signups."
Dear OLD users,"If someone doesn’t reply immediately here’s a shockingly new idea; they might be busy?!
I know it’s totally mind blowing...

The amount of people who cannot understand that people work in places where phones aren’t allowed, or who need sleep instead of messaging a person they’ve never met astounds me. 

Y’all are grown ass adults. 
Please don’t be that person who gets butthurt because someone hasn’t replied in an hour.

Lots of love,
A VERY frustrated girl who is sick of telling people that work is a thing and I can’t reply instantly."
Why aren't people dating?,"I think it's so interesting.  So many if my friends, normal good looking social people have never had relationships or been on dates.  Apparently 15 yo's in the 90s are more likely to have been on a date than 18 yo's today.  People are getting married later and later and a lot of the times not at all.  What shift in society happened as of recent?  Is it good bad or neither?  What do you guys think"
Probably the number one situation that people ask me about (as a dating coach).,"This has come up so often, and I see it come up here so often, that I felt it would be prudent to discuss it quick.

The number one thing people seem to ask about is what it means when someone doesn't reach out often, only replies when replied to, makes excuses such as being busy, or if they should reach out if the person isn't being very attentive, or has ghosted in some way (or all the way).

Let me make this very clear to all of you: This means they're not interested.

This is literally rule number one in dating: If a person is into you, they will reach out. No matter how busy they are, they will find the time. They will wake up saying good morning to you, and they will go to sleep saying goodnight. The more into you they are, the more they will shower you in attention. Even people who don't normally do that still will for the right person. It's undeniable, and anyone who claims they have never done that to anyone before--well, you've never met someone you've been super into then.

I've seen the same people have huge interest who reach out a ton, who suddenly lose interest and hardly reach out at all. The correlation is almost perfect, and it's basically a 100% thing. I've yet to meet an outlier on this one. I've HEARD people claim to be, then noted them acting this out to the letter. I've concluded this is just human nature, straight up simple end of story.

Everyone does this. I have seen people who never do this suddenly do this, exclaiming that they had never felt that way about someone before. When someone blows you away, you will behave like this. I don't care if you're 16 or 46--you'll do it.

When someone begins to fade, the easiest experiment you can do to find out if they're still interested in stop reaching out. If you feel like you're doing all of the initiating of contact/dates, then stop reaching out entirely. If by 2-3 days you haven't heard from them at all, remove them from the dating app you're likely on, and remove their number from your phone, because they're slow fading and you're about to have your time wasted.

Move on. Talk to 5 people at the same time--or 10 if you have to. Set up a date with someone different every day of the week if you can get away with it. This stuff is almost completely a numbers game. Eventually you just meet people who are more into you."
Validating the anger of man under 6'," 

I'm a tall mofo, so I'm not often affected by women's profiles asking for the man to be 6 or taller.

However,  I was just swiping and came across a handful of profiles that asked for  men to be 6 or taller in a distasteful way. If those profiles were  written in this format: ""Looking for a man 6 feet or taller"" then I  wouldn't have been inspired to make this post. In a single 10 minute  swiping session, I came across these profiles:

1: ""Don't be a midget. I'm 181 cm""

2: ""I'm a heightist. If you're 5' anything then swipe left.""

3: ""Short men need not apply""

I  feel bothered by this on behalf of men who don't qualify. I can only imagine how I'd feel if I was the target demographic of these profiles. Sorry,  my bros. Your pain is real."
You do need significant others.,"I wrote this out as a response to a very common comment I see in subreddits like this one where the commenter tells the poster that they shouldn’t need a significant other to be happy and that their sense of self worth should be higher. I understand that some people can function alone, but the average person cannot. Anyway, it’s a long post, but I think it’s worth saying.

Insinuating or explicitly saying that people should be happy alone is a lot of bullshit that metaphorically blind people perpetuate. The truth is that finding a significant other is an enormous part of the average person’s life; it is a constant in every culture around the world. In fact we are driven by a biological imperative to look for a significant other and in this sense, it is truly a necessity. Perhaps not in the way that water or oxygen is a necessity but more akin to needing a warm and safe place to call home. Ultimately we are slaves to the chemical signalling that drives our human machine.

Furthermore, what really is self worth? It seems like a common misconception is that self worth is determined solely by oneself in a vacuum (metaphorical), when in fact your sense of self is an object moulded by all the feedback from your environment. No one is born who they are and it doesn’t matter if you think you’re the greatest thing since sliced bread unless your environment gives you feedback to let you know it’s true. And as it turns out, one of the most rewarding feedbacks you receive from your environment is the affection of a significant other. It is validation of what you might have already hypothesized about yourself, but could not have possibly known to be true until verified. My point is that we really do need affection and significant others in our lives; the way that we are treated in society is important and determines how we fit in and function.

I understand that these things are complex issues without black and white answers. In fact, these things probably fall into a bell curve somewhere, but what we understand so far about humans tells us that the average person does in fact need a significant other/s as a necessity and cannot function alone. Functioning alone is actually a joke; everything we know about our biology tells us that we weren’t designed (metaphorically) to function alone. So can we please stop telling each other lies and minimizing the real frustrations that people post about. Maybe then we can actually solve problems and move forward instead of pretending like everything is perfect.

EDIT DISCLAIMER:
I understand that I am posting an edit to this post long after the thread's burial; originally I started going through the various replies and worked on writing an edit to further clarify and offer rebuttals to arguments posted in the comments. However, I was quickly overwhelmed and ultimately it felt like replying would probably be more work than it's worth. However today, I came across the document I used to write my responses and I wanted to delete it without letting the words go to complete waste. So below are my edits to try to respond to some of the concerns in the comment section. 

Edit 1:
It seems like there is some clarity required as to the definition for *need*; the definition that I used was based on human requirements that would cause large (subjective) amount of pain if left unfulfilled. It seems to me like a lot of the commenters to this post would only consider something a need if it would cause death if left unfulfilled. Herein lies some fundamental problems.

Edit 2:
With a more established definition of what *need* means, we can now look at some of the concerns regarding individuals that continue to argue that one does not need a significant other in their lives to be happy or fulfilled. Again, when concerning the average person, the want to have a significant other in their lives is a need because it is biologically driven; when left unfulfilled, it causes a great deal of pain (to the average person). The systems that drive humans to want to be with significant others is similar to the systems that reward us for eating calories and nutrients; evolution has shaped our biology to feel pain and happiness as a mechanism to control our actions to move towards the larger goal of the survival of our species.

A caveat to this argument though is that while companionship is a need, there are no laws in the universe that say that each human person will find at least one significant other. The world of biology does not operate this way at all and in fact natural selection is a key factor in ensuring the survival of species in general. So unfortunately, it is definitely possible that you can search your entire life for your significant other and still come out empty handed. The natural world doesn't care about pain and hurt feelings. However, this aspect of human interaction can be seen as a key driving factor for trying your hardest to stand out and excel as an individual.

I understand that all of these statements make it seem as though procreation is the ultimate goal for human individuals. While I'd be at a loss to argue against that since logically there can be no goal greater than existence itself, I want to stress again that this only applies to the average person; it would be entirely possible for individuals to live happy lives alone (I have known one such person), but it definitely cannot be the norm since if everyone decided to live alone, it would ultimately lead to the demise of the species and thus breaking the fundamental goal that our biology is attempting to optimize.

Edit 3:
Answering some of the comments arguing against my post requires a deeper look at human purpose in life. A lot of people draw purpose from religions and also create their own purposes and goals for their lives; I understand the appeal and while I would never try to take it away from anyone, the truth is that religions are all based on things that cannot be directly observed or proved and self prescribed purpose is by definition made up. I am of the opinion that there is no observable purpose to life in the large scheme of things; we exist, the universe exists as we see it and nothing more. But at the micro level, biological beings do have an observable purpose, especially if we allow form to dictate function. We observe through out the animal kingdom that life's purpose seems to be to continue to ensure existence, that is to say that each species seems to be optimizing for its own continued survival. And since humans are also animals, one of our most fundamental concerns in life is to ensure the survival of our genetic material. Again, this would only apply to the average person, since deviations from the norm cannot account for the larger goals of the species."
He deleted his tinder in front of me on our first date?,"A few weeks back I started seeing this guy, I've had some interesting dates from tinder (my fav being the flat earther--obviously ended that), anyway me and this gentleman hit it off straight away we ended up having a 3 hour telephone conversation before our first date and such.

Anyway when we were on the date obviously how we met came up and I admitted I had deleted my profile (he noticed that I wasn't on his messages anymore) and he pulled his phone out and said 'I'll take that as a good sign' and then proceeded to just delete his tinder.

This isn't really looking for advice as I am just going to assume that it's a good sign (our subsequent dates and such have been ace anyway)"
How to stop feeling like/being used as everyone's trophy girl?,"Everyone I’ve ever “dated” (never turned into serious relationships) has only wanted me because they consider me to be attractive, and I guess I’m what’s called conventionally pretty (not trying to sound snobby, it's just what people tell me). Before you say it, I dress conservatively and I honestly don’t sleep around. I don’t throw my self at guys, and I’m not even on dating apps. I’ve only ever “dated” three guys in my life. With that being said, I’ve still had the bad luck of only meeting people who only like me for my looks. They’re not even your typical player types - they start out really nice. But eventually they stop even trying to get to know me or my personality. It’s not like I’m dumb or boring - I have a master’s in Economics and have hobbies outside of that. But no matter how educated/interesting I could be, nobody wants to get to know me for who I am. Interestingly enough, even though I’ve made it clear that I won’t sleep with someone unless I’m in a relationship, these guys still keep inviting me over to only makeout with them, and then they brag about it to their friends.

To me this is weird because if sex isn’t on the table and they don’t want to be involved with me on a personal/emotional/serious level, then why stick around for just making out (its not like we’re high schoolers)? I’m 27, and these guys have all been either my age or older. They could easily not get involved with me and go sleep around with everyone else, so why bother? But I digress. Long story short, nobody cares about me as a person - they only care about my looks. I feel like I’m in a limbo; people want to ""date"" me and I have tons of options, but eventually all anyone cares about is how I look and how I make them look to their friends. I don't even feel like dating anymore, because I feel like its just going to be the same thing over and over again - guys only want to keep seeing me because I'm they find me attractive. 

It all feels so fake, and I feel completely disillusioned. Honestly, sometimes I think it would be better to be average looking/not attractive, because at least then you'd know from the get-go that the person you're dating is interested in your personality (I don't mean that hurtfully). I don’t think most people understand how bad it hurts to only be desired for your looks. I feel like nobody will ever want to be a companion to me. I’m happy and secure in myself and being single, but I’m still very lonely and want a boyfriend who sees past my looks. (Also, when I was in grad school, there were a few girls in my cohort who were like gorgeous. They were in serious relationships with guys who loved them and wanted them, so I know its possible. I just don't understand why it hasn't happened for me yet, especially since I really liked all three of those guys I dated).

TLDR: Nobody wants to date me seriously, they only like having me around for my looks. But I'm ready for a serious relationship and the real thing, and I want to be wanted for more than just ""being pretty""."
A friendly reminder to keep your options open...,"Was dating a guy last month who I was pretty excited about, had some small red flags that he might not be ready for something serious but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Turned out to be pretty flaky and just suddenly not making me a priority. Was upset about it, but decided to keep my options open and continue to go on dates.

Had a really nice date last night and at the end he said how he had a great time. When we hugged goodbye he said ""So, I would normally try to play coy, but I would really like to see you again. Do you want to XX on Monday night?"" (It was an activity we talked about during the date).

It was nice after this other guy making me feel like shit basically to just be like you know what, I *am* a catch and the right guy *will* make the time for me and be excited about me. It was also refreshing for someone not to play games and give the green light to I'M INTERESTED.

Keep your head up y'all, and get out there.

EDIT: this popped off way more than I anticipated. And things certainly didn’t translate within my post. I was not trying to brag, amongst other things. I simply meant it as ENCOURAGEMENT for those who were dating people who made them feel insignificant."
Difference between being needy & expressing your needs,"I find there is a big difference between the two, but society lumps them all into one and guilts people for it. 

In relationships, it’s OK to have needs within reason and anyone you’re in a relationship with that tells you they can’t meet them, just isn’t the person for you and that doesn’t make you needy. 

I think that’s separate and apart from people who use love as escapism and put heavy demands on a person because they hope it will make them happy internally. Another person can’t be responsible for making you happy, but another person can play a role in bringing joy to your life.

I find many women with low self-esteem question whether they are asking for too much and in reality they are asking for the bare minimum. That’s not needy. You’re just dating someone who is unwilling or can’t meet those needs. 

The last guy I dated I said “hey I like to talk on the phone sometimes” and he had excuses why he couldn’t, not even one day. I almost reverted back into my old thinking of ""maybe I am asking too much?"" No, I’m not and it’s not needy. 

Having needs is not negative."
You ever just make out with someone and think fuck when is this gonna be over?,I don’t know if this is normal. It happens even when I kiss/make out with someone I like. Granted I’ve never kissed someone I REALLY REALLY like but I don’t know if I’m even going to feel anything if I do. Is there something wrong with me?
I asked my crush out today AND SHE SAID YES!!!,"I still can't believe it happened! I'm 24 years old and this **is the first time I've EVER asked a girl out outside of a dating app**. I made a post on /r/dating_advice last week under an alt account, asking for advice on ***if*** I should be asking this girl out. What if I'm not her type? What if she says no? Will it be awkward? What if I mess up? But then as I was typing the post out I realized that the only way I'd ever get the answer to any of those questions was to *ask her out and find out for myself*. What the fuck was I doing asking strangers on the internet for? 

And so I did it! I was in class with my crush for all of today and I kept looking at her dreaming of finally asking her on a date. I was going to let her slide by as I always do. I came up with my usual excuses. I haven't shaved recently and I look unkempt. I'm not dressed well enough later I'll ask her when I look better. She doesn't know you, become her friend first. She's busy with class right now leave her alone!

But then at the end of class I noticed that she was staying behind to pack up her bag after talking to the professor. She was walking towards the exit and I was too so I held the door for her and just said ""Hey!"" awkwardly as I let her through. She said some greeting in return and then started to walk down the hall in the opposite direction. 

And then I could just feel something come over me. It was the perfect time. She's all alone! You don't have to embarrass yourself in front of your classmates! It's the perfect opportunity are you going to let her pass you by again!? Do it!!! And so I jogged after her down the hall and called out her name. It was awkward as I've never really spoken to her before! I just introduced myself and asked her if she wanted to grab some coffee later this week? I tripped over my words a bit and it didn't come out the way I always imagined it. My heart was pounding and my legs felt like jelly! Still she said YES!! 

I still can't believe it. The whole thing took like 90 seconds. I've gone through 4 years of college and I've NEVER been brave enough to approach a girl in person. Hell I've only gone on like 3 dates in my entire life! I can't believe that all it really required was about a minute or two of pure courage. 

I'm trying not to get too excited as I don't even know her yet (who knows if we're even compatible with each other) but I'm still hopeful! I wish I had done this years ago, I feel so empowered right now!

[Update here](https://old.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dcl51j/update_on_me_asking_my_crush_out_and_her_saying/)"
"For those of you that struggle with Tinder and/or other dating apps, some things to keep in mind","I'll keep this to the point

1) There's a chance that cute person you swiped right on didn't even see your profile. I've been seeing a girl for the past couple of weeks, and though I met her in person, I actually found her Tinder profile and swiped right. She thought it'd be cute/funny to swipe and match with me, but it took her a few days of swiping before she even found me, and we don't even live in a big city. So before you fret, just think about how many people use these apps and how many profiles there are

2) The large majority of people on there aren't as great as they want you to think. To put it more harshly: a lot of people on dating apps are simply memes. There's a reason why so many of them seem identical to one another (how many girls have you seen that love wine, tacos, travel, etc?). When I was younger (in my early to mid 20s) I'd think ""Damn, this girl is interesting and does a lot of cool shit"", but then show up to the date and find out they're really not. A lot of these people buy their own hype and aren't any better than you are. It gets less frustrating when you realize that, as cute as someone might be, they're dime-a-dozen

3) Don't assume that dating is easier for good looking people - we still have to deal with the same problems anyone else does. I'm a handsome, fit guy with his life in order and a bright future. I get a decent amount of (good) matches given how shitty the options are around me. Do you know how many girls actually follow through on meeting up? Very few. To give you an example, last week I was supposed to have five dates. I only ended up going on one (one of them was canceled by me though, after I found out the girl was using old pics and looked different from her profile)

4) This one is for the guys, though I'm sure girls have experienced this too. If there's any piece of dating advice I repeat the most, it's this: a lot of the girls on dating apps have no intention of actually meeting up. They're just attention starved, and dating apps are an incredibly easy way to get that attention. Why do you think you see so many profiles with maybe a sentence or two at most and then their Instagram/Snapchat handles? They don't want you, or anyone else for that matter. They want your attention. And yeah, I know, ""Well they'd go out with you if you had model looks and were rich"". You're probably right, but: 1) That kind of dude isn't gonna settle for generic Tinder thot, and 2) why would you want to be with someone like that anyways?

5) Think of dating from an economic standpoint: what you get is what you're able to add to the (dating) economy. In other words, you will get the equivalent of what you're offering. And no, there's no such thing as ""fair"" - dating is amoral

6) The other piece of advice I repeat a lot: most of the people actually worth dating aren't on an app. Yes, there are exceptions, but by and large apps aren't the place to be to find anything more than a date or two or something casual

7) Get better at in-person interactions. I've noticed that A TON of people are smart, funny, witty, whatever they want to be behind their phone's screen, but face-to-face they're just average. For the longest time I felt like I had no clue what I was doing when it came to talking to girls on Tinder, and then I realized it's because talking over a screen when first meeting someone is awkward, especially when they don't give you much to work with. I also knew that I was much better where it counted: in-person. Don't be fooled by people who seem amazing over an app - it's easy to build a persona and sell a persona that isn't representative of reality

8) That person you were talking to that randomly ghosted you, even though it seemed like things were going well? You haven't lost anything. Truth is, they either a) don't actually know what they want, or b) just want attention. There's a reason why you see a lot of the same people consistently on dating apps over the years

9) A lot of people, guys and girls, have unrealistic expectations. Sure, that girl might pass on you because you're not six feet tall with a killer body and amazing career, but focus on what's really important here: none of those people are dating her, or are going to date her. Yes, it stings when you get passed up for shallow things like that, but realize that, at the end of the day, those people are still single, and will eventually have to settle. I got passed over a ton when I was younger; now when I see those girls and who they actually ended up with, I feel a lot better about myself

10) It's all a numbers game. All it takes is one"
This sub is super depressing,"Every post I see is “woe is me” and it made me realize two things. 
1. There are more hopeless guys and gals out there who are going through the same struggle. 
2. After reading other hopeless posts from an outside perspective, I realized how pathetic my behavior has been. 

With that said, I think this sub really opened my eyes and made me realize that life isn’t fair. Some of us have to try harder than others. If you yourself aren’t particularly attractive but want an attractive partner, you gotta fight for him/her. It’s like anything in life. Shit doesn’t simply get handed to you. You have to earn it. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is “thank you”? Thank you for showing me how I could end up if I don’t get self-confidence, take risks and step out of my comfort zone albeit without compromising my values and principles. 

I hope others who are lonely and hopeless can eventually have the same outlook.

Edit: a user has misinterpreted the phrase “fight for him/her”. The word fight is another way of saying one needs to make the effort whether that be battling one’s own insecurities, stepping out of his or her comfort zone, etc. 
It does NOT mean chasing someone who isn’t interested in you. I’m sorry if people are misinterpreting it that way."
"If you’re not at ease on a date, leave but please be polite about it.","Honestly I’m dumbfounded.
I (23F) met this guy on tinder a few weeks back. After a fortnight of texting, sexting, sending photos, we agreed on a date to meet. He was really excited and told me multiples times how he « could not wait ». 
Which happened. We met. 
Guy arrives at my house and we have a nice little chat for about an hour. Honestly I think it was going well. No sloppy subjects, no blanks in the conversation, he looked relaxed and so did I. Then he suddenly hits me with:
« Okay. I don’t want to be here. It pisses me off. I’m leaving. ». I was so, so, so surprised. We were having a chat, and right in the middle of it, he just... said that. 


And there goes my fucking rant: you have every right to feel uncomfortable and every right to leave, I left many dates myself. But I always managed to do it in the most tactful way and polite manner (like: « Sorry, I don’t think this is working, I’ll be leaving now. Thanks for the night »)

I can handle rejection, but what I can’t handle is feeling like shit because my date is leaving w/o explanations and in the rudest way possible.
It happened yesterday, and I’ve spent all day and most part of the night wondering if I did something wrong to deserve such a nasty comment. 

Please, please, please, if you want to leave a date, please do, but don’t be rude about it. I still don’t understand what went wrong, most likely never will and I feel terrible."
Am i the only guy with this view??,"Sex is not even good, I want a loving relationship. I want to feel loved and to share my love. Like at first I thought hey i want sex but when I lost my virginity recently I realised sex isn't all that. Most guys and girls I know talk about sex this sex that but like its not even good to me. I want a relationship that i can build a future around and settle down I dont care to have sex."
Are inexperienced girls unattractive to guys? How do I do a better job of putting myself out there?,"So I have a two part question: 
1. I (24F) have never been in a relationship. I haven’t even had my first kiss and I’ve never been on a date before. As I get older I’m starting to worry that my lack of experience may be a turn off to guys. Is that something I should be worried about? 
2. I’m pretty shy and reserved when I first meet a guy, especially if I’m attracted to him, so I find that sometimes they can have a hard time connecting with me. People have suggested dating apps to me, but I’m not interested in dating apps as I get anxious for my safety when it comes to meeting strangers on the internet. Also, I don’t want to lead anyone on when I have no intention of meeting them in person. Does anyone have any advice for how I can put myself out there and meet guys in real life?"
Just a reminder for those trying to navigate the world of dating,"I don’t know who needs to see this but yeah...

If someone wants to be with you, they’ll be with you. No questions, no ifs, buts or maybes. People will make it work if they want to make it work. 

Don’t let anyone treat you as an option. 

You’re so much better than that.



Edit: as a simple post to remind myself if anyone else, i just wanted to say hearing all the stories and echoes of similar strains within the dating world, i feel way more hopeful and fired up than i have in the past few months. 

We’re all worth it. I truly believe that and you should too. 

I hope this reminder helps you do whatever it is you need to do and be the best version of you that you can be, with or without your crush. "
If you're not into someone just tell them!,"So one thing I've been dealing with while dating is when someone realises you're not the person for them but then string you along for ages and ages.

It's much less hurtful to be told ""I'm just not that into you"" than feel like you're fighting a losing battle trying to keep someone you never had. Leaving morsels of ""maybe in a few months"", ""I'm not ready yet"", and getting drunk and sending messages about how much you like us is confusing and hurts more in the long run. 

This isn't only for men or women... everyone should take this advice. In trying not to hurt someones feelings, instead you're giving them hope where there is none. You're letting someone hang on to you knowing you won't take it further. 

Sure, in that moment, the rejection sucks. But a definitive answer means I can start moving on. Telling me ""if we met at a different time, things would be different"" just makes me want to wait a few months and try again and that's totally not fair if you're just not interested.

I know some people will say, well if you know they're stringing you along then why put up with it? And the reason is because all logic and sanity seems to go out of the window when you genuinely like someone. You want it to work so you make excuses and even if you tell yourself that theres always a part of you that wonders what could have been. Was the person being genuine? Could it have worked out if you were just a bit more patient?

It's so unnecessary to keep hurting someone because you don't  wanna deal with upsetting someone."
Dating is ruthless,"Met a wonderful girl on tinder. We hit it off and began dating without calling each other “boyfriend/girlfriend”. I fell for her hard. She said I was everything she looked for in a partner. Out of nowhere she began acting distant, unaffectionate, and then just texted me “this isn’t going to work out.” We only dated for a month and a half, but I met her family, her friends and I began to open up to her and trust her. She did the same with me. I thought we would begin to actually date one another, but I guess that’s not the case. I just needed to vent this out. 

Moral of my story: dating is ruthless, folks. Don’t give your heart away so easily to people who don’t deserve it. Be careful"
Suggested an expensive restaurant on first date - should I just move on?,"The first response from this girl is: ""better discuss this in dinner"", I tried: ""choose your fav restaurant, dinner is on me"", then she suggested a restaurant that, from what I can find in Google, it costs $600 for two person excluding alcohol...

This is weird right? Should I just ignore and move on?

&#x200B;

\-- EDIT --

Thanks for all the replies and the guys who messaged me not to date with her. Apparently this is a scam and I'm not going out with her."
I told my crush I like him with the paper crane,"This is an update for my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/dsrqhl/im_gonna_tell_my_crush_i_like_him_this_friday/) about how I wanted to tell my crush that I like him today. I did it!!!

I gave him the paper crane, and I told him to open it after school.

After school, I waited many hours, and got no text from him. I was already feeling like a failure, and was heavily preparing myself for rejection.

But then... HE TEXTED ME!! AND HE SAID HE LIKES ME TOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Im legit so happy!! We were both kinda freaking out, and he said he is gonna write a letter back to me on a paper crane and give it to me irl!! And he also asked me to the movies on Sunday!!!! I’m so hyped!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Side note: Thank you to everyone who supported me, and hyped me up!! It really helped me get the courage that I needed to finally tell him! I honestly had thoughts of bailing out, but I remembered everyone cheering me on, and stuck with my plan :)"
Does anyone else feel Black Mirror-esque that our dating lives are dictated by some unknown algorithm developed by corporations?,"Most of these dating apps are owned by one company, and their algorithm is being kept secret to the public, we have no idea how the apps decide to show us the profiles that we see, and how we are being rated by the apps. We are essentially told by these apps who we see and who to match with, why are we so complacent to a corporation dictating such an important part of our lives? I think there should be some transparency on exactly how these apps work."
Do you ever get so much anxiety talking to the person you like that you'd rather just not talk to them at all?,"I don't know, I'm so anxious and hyped up, I can't even enjoy it."
My ex girlfriend passed away. I’m overwhelmed with sadness and guilt. I can’t stop crying...help.,"I found out on NYE that my ex girlfriend passed away on Christmas Eve. Sadly, our relationship faded toward the end of 2018; and it did not end amicably.  I haven’t tried to date anyone else since. I went through a healing process in 2019 and started to really love and take care of myself. I was head over heels in love with her and wanted her back in my life. I was hoping to reconnect with her in 2020 to rekindle, at the very least, a friendship. I wanted to apologize to for drifting away and for not giving any effort to fight for her.  Now my heart is guilt stricken and I haven’t been the same since I learned she passed. My eyes are full of tears everyday. I have tried to distract the pain; however, there’s no treatment plan for this pain. I’m a wreck :("
"Ladies of Reddit, what made you feel the Spark?","We all love to feel it.  When did you?

With guys you stuck it out with, what did they say or do during your first few dates that really made you feel connected?  What really made you feel like you could open up and be yourself, that made you feel alive?

Let’s all have less drama and more fun!"
We cuddled and held hands for 3 whole hours,"I recently joined a new theatre group. The other day, we all went out at night.

I'm not sure why, but at 3am, I ended up talking to F, who had been really nice to me from the start. He wrapped his arm around me and started hugging me.

We ended up sitting together and talking. He is a rather shy-ish, skinny, nerdy guy who works on cyber security.  We cuddled, held hands, carressed eachorther. He kissed me a few times on my forehead. Our faces were super close... I really felt something.

He has a girlfriend. I want to die."
First tinder match came back around after I lost weight and now it's really shaken my confidence. I'm not sure how to get past it.,"I started using tinder for the first time earlier this year after a pretty large amount of weight loss >50lbs. I was feeling confident for the first time in a long while and matched with some great guys as well as some not so great ones. The first guy I actually ended up sleeping with got really weird after the sex and basically gave me a rather soft-handed rejection in the form of telling me he was going to be too busy to see me again. It stung obviously, because I liked him as a person and wouldn't have minded seeing him again, but I just let it go and moved on. 

Spent the following couple months since then making new matches, going on dates, having a pretty good time overall! During that time I lost another pretty fair amount of weight, about 20 pounds. Well, a couple weeks ago that first match and I started chatting again on instagram. Nothing major, in fact it was pretty boring conversation that we both let die fairly quickly. UNTIL I posted a progress photo of my most recent weight loss. 

Within an hour that first match messaged me, telling me that I had slimmed down and was flirting with me, actually fun to talk to again. It only took a few messages for him to ask if I wanted to see him again. I had a nagging suspicion so I asked him straight out if he only wanted to see me again because I'd lost weight. 

He admitted that yes, while he'd thought I had a great personality, was intelligent and fun to spend time with, when we'd slept together,  it turned out that I was bigger than he'd thought (despite having non-edited, true to life full body pics on my profile, AND having gone on a couple dates with me in person) which definitely explains some of the comments he made to me after the sex, as well as the brush off 'I'm too busy to see you again.'

That was a couple weeks ago and the whole thing has really shaken my confidence. I've lost a huge amount of weight but my body is not perfect by any means and it never will be. I've had some great matches lately that I have completely let fizzle just a couple chats into it because when quarantine is all over and we actually have a chance to meet in person, even if the chemistry is great, I'm scared they're just going to be disappointed if I allowed them to see my body."
Crossed state lines for a date- stood up and ghosted.,"So last week I (M29)  started talking with a woman (23) on a dating app. She asked me if I was going to take her out for dinner sometime soon and since I had been trying  to get myself back into dating after a failed, 3 year engagement which ended in January, I jumped at the chance. 

We had talked for the whole week (video and voice calls), added each other on snap, traded numbers,  and made plans. 

Today I woke up early to work for 8 hours so I could leave at 2pm for the four hour drive to where she is. We had correspondence the whole way and she sent me an address to pick her up at. When I got to her neck  of the woods she said her mom stopped by and asked me to wait fifteen minutes before going to her place. I parked at a shopping block and picked up a bouquet. 45 minutes later she said I could come pick her up. 

While I found the neighborhood she gave me, I couldn't find the house number she specified so I tried to text, then call her. She didnt respond or answer. After driving in circles around the neighborhood for an hour and some change I decided to get a hotel room. As I write this post I am sitting in a Days Inn with the flowers I got her. 

I could have stayed home, ordered a pizza and watched The Witcher...this had been my plan since knowing its release date until she and I had connected. 

Anyways. Happy Holiday season to all of you."
"Can we stop assuming and telling people that they're ""not attractive"" when giving advice here?","A typical exchange I'm very tired of seeing here is when a person (and most times, it tends to be a guy, but I'm sure it happens to women, too) who is asking a question about a dating experience. Maybe they got ghosted and are trying to figure out what happened. Maybe the other person has been sending mixed signals about wanting to meet. Maybe the person on the other side of the screen is putting in hardly effort into the conversation. Whatever the case, inevitable someone (and in ALL cases, it is a guy) chimes in and says, ""It's because you must not be attractive.""

This ""advice""is never based off of any evidence such as pictures of the OP that would suggest that much,. Even if the OP describes themselves perfectly accurate and honestly, and really is decent looking, there are still these commenters who insist that every dating failure is due to a lack of being physically attractive.

People come here for helpful advice and not a reason to feel even worse about dating. We should not be looking for opportunities to tear them down. It's not difficult to not be a dick. While there are definitely people who may be setting expectations too high out there, I'd like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and assume that if they can get a match and a conversation going, they weren't hideous.

If any mods are reading this, I'd like to see toxic and unhelpful comments such as this resulting in temporary/permanent bans of commenters."
I managed to man the f up today. Man it feels good. Today was a good day and I’ll write this down on my journal,"I was supposed to ask her out this recent Monday but I pussied out. So today I thought “should I wait for another week for this?” So I managed to man the f up today after class and asked her (classmate of mine)  

We were walking together, I paused walking, so she paused too. I looked at her straight in the eye and asked her if she wants to go grab some food (sushi place)  after class. She replied that she needs to go to a family member immediately after class. So I asked her when she’s free and she said maybe next week or week after that. So I said “oh okay, I’ll see you in class next week then” 

I took it as rejection, and that’s fine with me. It just feels so good that I managed to man the f up and now I feel like I just slayed a dragon. AND, atleast I get to be honest with myself and to her. So now I won’t be expecting much anymore. It was a good day because I finally became honest with my feelings to someone, and of course to myself too."
A kind gesture turned into a date.,"Ladies — being open and present is your best asset. 

I was at a street fair/festival this afternoon. Mind you, I’ve never been in this city and I’m here for several days for work. I wanted to check out the fair. Very crowded and hot. I was standing at a pub table watching the next band set up their equipment. Just hanging out and people watching. 

I noticed a man in front of me who looked appealing. He seemed alone, so I got his attention and asked if he was solo. He was, so I invited him to post up and share my table (a place to set his beer, etc). 

We had a very nice chat and he asked me out to dinner. Simple as that. 

We exchanged numbers and have plans for him to take me to dinner later or tomorrow night (depends on my work schedule). 

He gave me his full name and place of employment (so I can look him up and make sure he’s not a creep — his suggestion). 

All because I was open and saw an opportunity to make a connection. 

He thinks I’m cute, too. 😊"
Anyone else not into dating casually?,"I go into relationships with a long-term mindset. I’m not sure why but I can’t see myself going into a relationship knowing it’s gonna go nowhere. 

Anyone else feel the same?"
Something I learned recently: people that go all in really quickly tend to disappear just as quick,"I've met a couple of people like this and I've finally learned something from it.

If somebody goes all in really quickly (I'm thinking within weeks), then that's got to be a major red flag. Because my experience is those who go all in really quickly will say they are suddenly not interested (if they're nice) or just disappear - just as quick.

Learn from my mistakes!"
I feel like I’m trying to force a relationship into my life,"For the past 3 years I’ve been trying to get a girlfriend by going out clubbing, going on dating apps, approaching girls — but nothing’s worked. I feel like I’m trying too hard. 

Maybe I should just focus on self improvement and join new clubs for the sake of having fun and maybe then I will get a girlfriend, when I’m least expecting it"
Anybody here gets paralyzed in dating because they think they aren’t good enough for someone?,"Does anybody here think that they arent good enough for someone? Im a bit of a perfectionist so everytime someone asks me if Im in a relationship or dating someone, I always tell them that I want my life all figured out before I get into that. I dont know if its just me or someone else gets this type of thought or feeling too. For me, I always want to make sure that I wont have any shortcomings if I ever get into a relationship. I just can’t see myself selling myself short to someone. But all my friends keeps telling me that figuring life all out is impossible because even the richest people in this world have troubles in their relationships too. I dont know, I guess I’m just too much of an idealist/ perfectionist and I guess that’s what is stopping me."
"She said yes to being my valentine, trouble is I didn't plan that far. Tips?","Yeah, got no clue. Plus all the theaters are closed rn. What can a couple 17 year olds do on valentine's day?


(Edit 1: Did not expect so many people to care. I want to thank each and every one of you for your advice/encouragement/witty remarks. 
Some of you have asked me to keep you updated so if you care about that sort of thing stay tuned. Love you all.

Edit 2: Unfortunately we did not go out because her mother was worried about the ongoing virus outbreak :/. Thanks again to everyone for the great comments. I'll be sure to take her out when this whole corona virus thing is over.)"
Some people are really classy,"Went on my first date after a long break. He was sweet, smart, and a good guy. We found out we had a major incompatibility. We decided not to go out again and wished each other well. No hurt feelings, just honest and kind communication. It didn’t work out, but I enjoyed the experience nonetheless. 


Good luck out there! Keep it classy!"
"Girls, please, if you reject a guy that asked you out, don't try and get his attention, you already know he likes you and you're just playing with him.","And those things people say like oh well, I'm not interested but we can still be friends is not healthy at all, why would you want the attention of a guy that you know likes you but he knows he can't have you. 

I find it extremely infuriating when this happens to me and sometimes I need to be rude in telling girls to please leave me alone so they get the mesaage. 

Rant over."
I can't believe what i recently experienced on tinder,"This was a while ago, since i met him on tinder and dont use it anymore. 
First i chatted with him nicely for about a week. After that he really made some exceptional and weird demands and remarks to me. And that is why i at a certain point stopped any contact with him.
Basically this is what he wanted. He wanted to date but i have to go to his town and take the train because his car was in the garage. He didnt want to come to me/my town because for him it was 30/45 minutes walking to the train station and otherwise he would have to take the bus that don't run that often in his area. 

He wanted a guarantee we would have sex on the first date. 
Then when I explained i wouldn't do that (of course) he said that he can fuck any of his fwb's any day of the week, so it would have to be a yes please for me or a no (i guess he expected me to feel lucky or thankfull or something).

And he made this comment i was quite average looking of all the women he had dated/had sex with.

After all this i stopped any contact with him but then he messaged me again this week if i want to fuck. 
I mean how weird and unrealistic are his expectations????

Edit; 
The first week he showed normal behaviour and was a nice guy. When it came to meeting he said all tbat stuff. For a little while i kept talking to him because i was really suprised since i didn't expect thjs. I soon blocked his number after his remarks became crazier and crazier. I think him mentioning i was just average compared to the women he had slept with, was actually just slightly before i turned him down for a date, not after,funnily enough. 
He approached me on social media this week,saying he was horny and if i wanted to fuck. He could easily find me i think because we had a mutual friend on fb."
Well I asked out the girl at work...,"And she said yes! To me she’s honestly gorgeous. And to my surprise she isn’t seeing anyone. So I got her number and we have been talking since yesterday via text.

All I’m saying is, if you want to ask someone out DO IT! You will all these thoughts running through your head like “what if this..” “what if that...” WHO CARES! 

From the moment I started here at my job she caught my eye and I was like “there’s no way this girl is single” and even people at work thought she was dating someone. But I got word from her manager (low key we talk about some personal stuff) and she was convinced we should go out. So I did it and to my surprise she wants to go out as well. Just wanted to let some positivity out on this beautiful Friday!"
Look for a laugh? Please enjoy my suffering,"So I've never posted here but wanted to share some highlights from my date yesterday. Met her on hinge, I'm 25 Male she's 31 female. Usually only young girls are into me but figured let's see how this goes, she probably has her shit together...boy was I wrong. She wanted to get coffee, and here are some things she said..THAT I NEVER ASKED ABOUT AT ALL. I think I said 10 sentences the whole date haha. Please enjoy:


- kept talking about how much money she had, how cool she was, how she was a legend among her friends

- ""I never sleep with someone on the first date...like I'll suck their dick but that's it..and I'm really good at it""

- ""I broke up with my last boyfriend because he would only look at my face"" (I asked for clarification..she means he only looked at her face when they talked and never looked at her boobs....yeah that's right)

- ""I always ask how big a guys dick is on the first date...I don't want to waste my time""

- ""You're actually a little short for me, my cutoff is usually 6'5.""
 (I'm 6'1 she's 5'4)

- ""Guys always get obsessed with me and follow me around...probably because I have a perfect body and am rich""

- ""So I slept with this guy on Tuesday but I don't think I'm going to see him again.""

- ""I am going out with a guy again on Friday, I haven't slept with him but his dick is huge...but I asked him if he would be ruff when we have sex and he said ""I guess so"" so I don't think he'll actually be ruff enough..I like to get slammed against a wall.""

- ""I use to own a condo over here but I bought a house so I could be as loud as I want when I have sex""

- ""I've never liked anal sex...I think guys like it if someone's vagina is loose but I'm super tight.""

- ""Being with me is a privilege, look at me! so if a guys dick is going to be inside this then it has to be big""

- ""I have a very specific type of guy I like...they have to be super hot..that's it actually...oh and have a big dick.""

- "" I can't tell if you're into me..you're a hard read, you haven't tried to kiss me yet and aren't sitting very close to me"""
"I'm shy. I'm boring. I'm ""nice"". And I can't help it.","I'm 24 years old and I couldn't begin to tell you how many times I've come to the internet looking for help. Unfortunately, it's never made a difference. I'm still the shy, boring, ""nice"" (whatever the hell that even means) guy I have always been. I'm not good at initiating, I'm not good at teasing or banter, and I don't know what to say past ""hello"". No I don't wear a fedora and no I don't think women owe me anything because I'm nice to them. On the contrary, I completely understand why you're not attracted to me. But damn, it's really hard sometimes when I realize I'll probably be lonely my whole life because of the way I am."
A scientific look into why some men leave after sex,"Maybe you've heard men say ""Women get so attached after sex"".. Or maybe you've heard women say ""After sex, he seemed not as interested"".

I wasn’t going to post this but I think that it might give some insight even just a tiny bit into why some men “leave after sex”.  I’ve seen many posts about women wondering why the man only wanted sex and everything was fine before sex etc on here so I just wanted to give a little bit of “biology fun fact” type of information on the male and female brain during sex. **Im not an expert by any means** but I am a biology enthusiast going for her doctorate now (not a biologist though) so I’ve read up on this a little bit enough to post this information here which might give some insight to some situations which I think could potentially a tiny bit helpful or interesting.

—————————————————

**Edit: DISCLAIMER: I am not an expert biologist specializing in this topic.** However, the studies I've read and information on hormones is public information. Do your own research please as well. 

**My point for this post was to give/add a different perspective on sex on this subreddit.** There are many variables and every human is different. There are also different situations and nuances. 

—————————————————

**TLDR:** When a man and woman have sex, oxytocin is released. Women feel this “cuddle hormone” and men don’t because their high level of testosterone blocks it. A man's vasopressin (lust and attraction hormone) that had been building up for the woman prior also drops after sex. 

This hormone allows women to feel closer and good about her relationship with the man. Whereas the man hasn’t felt that at all, and due to the dropped vasopressin and not feeling oxytocin, he will move on to spread his seed. 

Only when a man has true feelings for a woman and he makes the decision to commit/be vulnerable/let his guard down with her, his testosterone drops enough to feel oxytocin. This is when the man and woman both feel oxytocin and bond and both “make love”. Oxytocin gives feelings of trust, love, etc.

**PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO by an expert biologist who says everything I'm saying with references and study data:**  **Dawn Maslar’s Ted Talk** - which sums this information up perfectly in short video form (called: ""How Your Brain Falls In Love"")

—————————————————

**Longer Version**

This is the cuddle hormone and for women, it skyrockets during sex. This hormone comes out when a woman is giving birth and having sex etc. it makes the woman feel bonded to the man and more trusting and closer to him (and her baby during pregnancy).

The high level of testosterone in men blocks the effects of oxytocin. He does not feel those same effects of a closer bond with the woman (there are exceptions, more on them later).

In fact, vasopressin in men builds as he feels sexual attraction for a woman like when dating her, seeing her, being in anticipation, etc (lust, attraction, affiliation hormone). But immediately after sex, his vasopressin buildup for the woman drops. And testosterone blocks oxytocin.

So therefore after sex, the woman is feeling closer to the man and good about the relationship. 

Whereas a man's vasopressin buildup for the woman has dropped and he hasn’t felt the effects of oxytocin at all. Due to biology, if he didn’t have feelings for the woman, it is in his nature to continue to spread his seed elsewhere. 

**HOWEVER, THIS IS THE EXCEPTION: when a man HAS FEELINGS for and/or LOVES a woman** and decides he wants to commit/be with her in his mind, his **testosterone levels DROP when he lets his guard down and makes the decision to be vulnerable to her**, allowing him to feel the same in love, bond, trust feelings of the oxytocin hormone as the woman does during sex. 

Due to the lowered level of testosterone, oxytocin is now able to work and that is when a man is able to “make love” to the woman and feel all of the oxytocin hormone.

Why does it seem so unbearably difficult to get a girlfriend these days?,I just don’t get it anymore. It’s bizarre that anywhere I go I constantly see guys with girlfriends/wives & a lot of the time these women are attractive. But it just seems like no one even bothers to talk to one another anymore unless they know them already. Online dating is a huge disaster unless you have an amazing job or top tier looks. So what is it that women are even looking for these days? Why is it so difficult yet I always constantly see people together. It’s like I feel like I’m in some sort of Matrix or something where things are just meant to happen for others when I’m not around. Yet I never ever see anyone get asked out in person or anything. If it’s so difficult how do so many people find it so easy? I’ve heard of people getting out of relationships than finding another in like 3 weeks time. I just don’t get it at all.
I need cuddles,"***IDK if this is allowed to be here but it is***

It's really annoying to want/need someone in the sense of physical affections because I need them meaning I don't have them right now. I really want my boyfriend rn like I need cuddles and I'm probably gonna get emotionally affected by not being able to cuddle them but I can't really do much yet cuz I don't have a lot of control over my life. so yeah I need cuddles 

Cuddles are nice"
Guy I've Been Seeing for a Month Told Me I'm Too Fat for Him,"After a month of dating and hooking up the guy I've been seeing told me his ideal partner is a 5'3 130lbs petite woman.  The conversation occurred because I had stopped doing/tracking my IF. I am not petite, and am working on being healthier but don't feel like my worth as a partner should be directly tied to how much weight I'm losing/not losing.  Any effort to explain how hurtful this was was met with ""I guess I'm a bad guy for having sexual preferences.""

ETA:  I am 5'7 so no matter how much weight I lost or didn't lose I would still never be his ""ideal""

Girl insisted that I pay after I asked for 2 bills,"First time I post here! I have been dating for years and I felt like sharing my last exeprience!

I went out to a bar with a woman I met on tinder. Things were going great, we both were having a great time, lots of sparks in our eyes, touching each others hands, smiling, conversation was flowing. So after 5 hours of non stop talk, its getting late and we both have to catch the last subway. So I ask the barperson if we can get the bill. I ask for two of them.

&#x200B;

At this instant, the woman looks at me and she transformed herself. She ask why was I not offering to pay? I'm surprised and I tell her I simply don't usually pay when I meet someone for the first time, it makes me uncomfortable and puts pressure. She then, proceed, and I kid you not, to say out loud: I would have never taken so many drinks if I knew. You had to tell me, its unfair. 

At that point the bartender sees this happening and come over to make sure everything is okay, and she ask him for 1 bill only (that I would pay). He looks at me and I ask him for two, and he leaves a little confused. 

We then talked a little and I tried to joke around to release the tension, and she told me that if I paid, wed go to my place after. 

I kept on joking around and we ended up paying each other her bill, while she was rambling during the whole time she was paying. We went to the subway,and went our own way!

&#x200B;

It was quite the funny experience and I felt like sharing it with you guys!"
Has anyone else experienced a crushed heart when hearing about someone you like getting with someone else?,Has anyone else experienced a feeling their heart slowly being crushed when hearing about someone they like being with someone else?
Don’t be too hard on yourself after that initial excitement wears off and someone seems disinterested or leaves. The fantasy they created of you probably was killed by reality.,"Reposted because it got deleted. Feel others should see this and hopefully not be so hard on yourself. 

Ever have someone all in for awhile and then consistency changes? Yeah that’s probably what happened. 

I assume I potentially “killed” someone’s fantasy. I’m truly having a rough time and this person helped a lot to keep my mind settled. My natural assumption when consistency changes is “I fkd it up and prepare yourself to never hear from them again.” I used to spend years beating myself up. Every time it happened. Because it was so rare for me to connect on many levels. 

Honestly it should be rare. You shouldn’t be connecting with everyone you talk to romantically. I caught myself recently doing this. Then telling myself “I shouldn’t have to try so hard to keep someone in my life.” If they want to go let them. If they stop responding oh well. If they want to talk they will. 

Sending them a bunch of text will just make it worse. I have a horrible habit of over sharing, jumping too far ahead, rushing things. I get overly excited and talk too much. I then get relaxed. It’s something I need to improve on. I care deeply when I care. You might not be as important or “irreplaceable” to them as they are to you. 

 If you have never watched “the price of admission” on YouTube it’s something you should check out. Sometimes we build someone up so much that we think (and hope) they are a certain way. This tends to lead to being disappointed. I try to stay open minded now and let the person open up. Truly see how they are. Not who I want them to be. 

So you’re very caring. Not everyone is that way. Not everyone has a good heart, good intentions for you, or is right for you. Sadly someone may be responding because they are nice. They may just like having someone to talk to. Especially if you haven’t met in person. Take it for what it is. A good conversation. Sadly it’s just how it is now. They may like you as a person, but not as a romantic partner. They may be working up the courage to tell you. They may never tell you. 

Some people also don’t know how truly rare it is to connect with someone on the majority of levels romantically, sexually, and conversation wise. It’s ok if you killed the fantasy they had of you. If they truly wanted you and you fit with them they wouldn’t be so quick to jump ship. Enjoy things while they last. None of us are perfect. Just don’t build a fantasy so high that no one can ever reach it.

Edit-I’m glad my horrible life experiences can maybe help others. Thanks for gold kind stranger!"
PSA to you lonely redditors out there: it’s better to be lonely than to settle,"I’m posting this because I’m lonely. But I’m happy to be lonely. I was in a relationship with someone who I ultimately settled for because I was just so lonely and I wanted to know what it was like to be “in love” and to have a long lasting relationship.

But I was wrong. I thought I was in love, I tried to convince myself I was in love.. but I wasn’t. I watched the other couples in my life and I knew deep down that we didn’t have the same love they did. They fit perfectly together, always sat next to each other, were protective of each other. Sometimes I would even forget my SO was in a room. I would compare him to other guys. And I felt so so guilty about it but I told myself to push down those feelings. And I did for a long time.

When I finally got the courage to break it off I felt like the worst person in the world. I felt selfish. I felt disgusting. But I had to remind myself that I’m a human being. And sometimes it’s okay to sort out your feelings and act accordingly.

But I also felt free. I felt like I was giving myself the opportunity to find real, true love. The love people write about. I want that for myself. Right now I’m lonely, I miss what I had with my SO, being held and told I was loved. But I’d rather be lonely and looking than loved and settling. I’d rather go on 1000 crappy dates trying to find the one for me. I’d rather agonize over asking someone out and wondering if they like me. 

Because at the end of the day, no one deserves to settle. And no one deserves the kind of love someone gives when they are settling. 

So I’m writing this to let all of the lonely people out there to know: don’t settle. Loneliness sucks but trust me, settling is so, so much worse. And love is worth the wait."
To all the sad and lonely singles out there,"Date and treat the f**k out of yourself, and do it often.

I too feel the void at times, especially now that it’s summer and I have more free time, but I’m filling it with things that make me happy.

I used to want to do so many first things with my eventual first SO, but I’m 21 going on 22 and I’m not going to put my life on hold.

While I’m waiting to meet that special guy I’m doing all the things I’d want to do with a partner.

Today I went strawberry picking with a friend and tonight I drove down by myself to a really cozy college town in my state. I’ve been craving this particular ice cream for several months and went to the parlor that makes the best ice cream I’ve ever had. 

At first it felt a little strange and slightly sad, probably because the only other time I’ve been there was with a guy I used to date (no more feelings though because he was truly terrible but I’m glad I got a good ice cream spot out of it), but also because there were couples everywhere. 

But that feeling didn’t last long. The weather was great, I found a nice seat outside, walked around after and then listened to one of my favorite podcasts on the drive back.

Being single doesn’t suck as much when you date yourself. 

Plus I got to just spontaneous jump up and do whatever it was that I wanted to do and when I wanted. And there’s a lot of good and comfort in that freedom and flexibility.

Just thought I’d share because I’ve been seeing a lot of posts lately about people who’ve never been in relationships and people having a hard time being single.

Edit: Thank you for all of your responses and for sharing your stories and advice and perspectives. I believe I read them all. Work has been busy so I haven’t really been on here much. I may try to respond to some. Ironically, in the time since I posted this and now I’ve met someone. I decided to dabble in online dating although I really don’t prefer it and I met someone. So far we click really well and he literally checks off every single character trait I’m looking for. It seems like once I became okay with being single and started to have fun while still keeping an eye open, I found someone. We’ll see how it goes!"
I hate this dating game. I'd love a first date with all the rules thrown out the window.,"Wild concept. Just my imagination going but I'd love a first date with a woman where neither of us give a shit about the rules of dating and just want pure honesty. We both show up in sweatpants and the t-shirt we were wearing the night before, her hair in a messy bun and mine not touched since I got out of bed and neither of us are in the best of moods. We'll talk about past relationships and the flaws that make us a not-so-perfect partner while passing a blunt back and forth. 

I want a first date like:  


  


""Hi I'm Jon. I'm not very experienced with dating. I was in love once but it didn't work out and I kind of didn't trust women for a long time, so I hid in a shell to avoid getting my heart broken again, I'm just trying to better myself bit by bit and day by day and I think maybe dating someone might be good for me. I've gained a lot of emotional maturity lately and I think I might be ready.  
So, where did you fuck up? why are you here? got any war stories?"""
The right person will want to spend time with you!,"So over the last year I've been single and online dating. I've gone on a ton of dates with different guys and I've broken things off for one reason or another with each one. There have been a few guys I really liked but they would only want to see me like once a week or two and barely text in-between dates. Trying not to come off as a crazy lady, I would always write this off as the guy being busy and try to play it cool and pull back on the texting/match their texting and pretend not to care that we only saw each other once every two weeks even if we lived 5 minutes from each other. If I brought seeing each other more often up they would just say they were too busy and didn't have time but wanted to continue dating and see where it would go. Eventually I'd jump ship because I'm too needy for that and could see it going nowhere!

People, do not fall into this crap!! Don't stay with someone who doesn't know what they want if you know what you want. If they don't text you and show interest and want to see you often, they aren't interested!! Every guy I broke it off with that only wanted to see me every other week wasn't upset in the slightest that I broke it off... Even the busiest people can make time for someone they're seriously interested in.

Anyways, I met someone who lives 2 hours away about a month ago. He has literally driven out to stay with me every weekend since our first date. (Reason being he just graduated from college and is still living with his parents so I can't stay over with him.) He sees me for 2-3 days a week despite the distance even though we aren't officially dating yet. He also talks about making it official and me meeting his family. I've also met his friends!! Even if we don't end up together forever, I know going forward I don't want to waste time with people who don't treat me like this. You shouldn't either!

10 Lessons Learnt from dating over an year.,"Female's Perspective : I read this list everytime I start talking to a guy.

1. Everything is temporary, the attention, they complimenting you, those words or acts of validation, they making you feel special.
Atleast in the initial days/months.

2. Don't try to built a rapport right away, it kills your rationale. Slow and steady always wins.

3. In reference to online dating - Be the same as you appear to be on chats or maybe a level up. Appearing bold and fun over screen is much easier than in person.

4. Stop being nice. Show your considerate, loving, accomodating self after someone is hooked to you emotionally. 

5. Sleep with a guy on the first day, only if you are okay with him not calling/texting you the next day. Men say a lot before taking you to bed and forget everything the next day. 

6. I don't care about you attitude goes long way. Be selfish, think only about you. Don't be mean or rude, but altering your ways or believes for someone doesn't work. Men will only value you as much as you value yourself. 

7. Know the red flags men show you and act on them when you see. Moving away from wrong people as fast as you can is the key to dating. 

8. Be a good kisser/in bed - educate yourself, tips tricks take you long.

9. Men often drive the conversations in and around sex, if thats not what you looking for just ask good questions in return. You should drive the nature of conversations you want to have. If he stops responding, he was never in it for you.

10. Date with an intention, if the guy says casual he means it, you can't turn it around. And if he doesn't say it, he definately means casual.


EDIT : 

#6, my words are harsh, I only meant, I will do me whether you like me or not. 

#4 : Stop being extra nice, apart from being a decent human being, your nice ness would be taken for granted."
"Before figuring out if they like you or not, dating is kind of stressful","One thing that is a bit anxiety inducing about dating is trying to figure out if they are into you in the beginning stages. If they don't message me for a while, then I'll just sit there and wonder if they are ghosting me now or what? Are they just busy? Like, when I finally know they are into me then I'm fine. I don't care if they dont text me for awhile or not. It's just that beginning stage that's hard to figure out that's a bit unsettling....i guess perhaps if I have to guess too much I should just move on or try dating two people at a time (if we are casually dating and are not exclusive yet)"
I took a chance and reached out,"I took one last chance to reach out to the guy I went on two amazing dates with. 

And I got my answer. Which was no reply.

I feel so much better now. I tried, I gave it a shot. The ball was in his court. 
I feel relieved knowing for sure now that he is no longer interested. I could have waited another week to hear from him, but that would have been a complete waste of time and energy.

I can move on now with no regrets!"
"My Tinder ""Date"" From Hell","Quick prequel - was dating this guy for awhile, really liked him. Long story short, he said he couldn't see himself marrying me but still wanted to date (i.e. fuck), so I broke up with him. Little bit of time went by, and I decided to get back into the dating pool via Tinder, even though I hate dating aps.

Matched with this guy ""Chad,"" hit it off via message. Good looking, educated, sense of humor. After a couple weeks exchanged numbers and continued chatting. Discussed meeting several times but our schedules clashed.

One day Chad texts me and asks to Venmo me some money to treat myself to a couple bottles of wine. Sounds awesome, I oblige. Also asks if I'd like to come over to his house after work. Says other people will be there, no pressure if I feel uncomfortable, etc. I actually didn't feel weirded out at all by this point (and I carry), so I agree.

I bring the wine (and my CC), and head over to Chad's after work. He is there, and two of his friends. They all seem perfectly nice and normal.

First weird thing: 4 total kitchen cabinets are completed ripped apart/smashed. This is a newer kitchen, nice cabinets. I inquire about the damage and Chad says he was ""mad,"" so he ""punched them."" Decide not to say anything additional about it. I grab an unopened beer for myself, then a coffee. Everything else is fine until I'm done with the coffee. One of the friends leaves, and a few minutes later it's like someone has flipped a switch on Chad. He completely loses his shit out of nowhere. Throws a metal barstool across the house, screaming like a lunatic child, chucks his phone into the kitchen wall. Remaining friend steps outside to smoke. Chad comes up to me out of nowhere and BITES my leg. I hit him in the head and he stops momentarily and then BITES me AGAIN. I hit him in the head hard as shit this time, and he stops. I ask for the bathroom, he walks over to show me and I don't know how else to explain this, but quite literally hurls himself up into the air in the hallway and lands flat on his back outside the bathroom door. Chad then gets mad that he has hurled himself onto the floor and punches a hole through the adjacent wall. I politely excuse myself to the restroom, in utter shock.

Come out of the bathroom, Chad approaches me and starts crying. Absolutely wailing. Going on about how is father is sick, this is a terrible time in his life, blah blah blah. I'm ready to get the fuck out but am concerned this guy may actually hurt himself and at the time felt some sort of responsibility to try to prevent that. I calm him down some, Chad's friend comes back in. Friend is suggesting we go fishing. Chad says he will, but would prefer to stay at the house to ""get to know me better."" No way in hell.

I agree to fishing so I can ""follow"" in my car and bail. Walk outside, Chad's friend gets in the driver's seat of Chad's car. I walk around and let the friend know I will be following in my car, he's cool with it. I get into my car (door is still open). Chad realizes I am not in his car, storms over and demands/begs I ride with them. Is completely adamant, but I stick to my guns and refuse. He says to ""go the fuck home then,"" and slams my car door shut. He then gets in the passenger seat of his car with his friend, and they drive off.

I sit for a few minutes calming down, processing, and pulling up GPS to go home. Start driving through the neighborhood. Make it around 3 corners and stop dead. Chad is standing in the middle of the road, facing me. He runs at my car FULL SPRINT, and slams both hands on the hood as hard as he can and runs them down like some sort of horror movie scene. He then runs over to my side, tries opening my door and rear door, screaming for me to open them. I decline. He punches my window, then the rear. I slam in reverse and floor it around the corner as he chases me on foot. Slam the car back in drive, and peel out of there as fast as I can. See the friend pulling back into the neighborhood and honk but don't slow down. I heard him yell ""sorry"" as I drive by.

&#x200B;

The next day Chad's friend found me on fb and messaged me apologizing, saying he has never seen that behavior before. Chad also texts me and tries to apologies, saying his friend told him he ""went psycho"" and he doesn't remember anything. I tell him he's lucky I didn't shoot him, and to never contact me again.

I have permanent bruises from the bites.

&#x200B;

TL/DR: Tinder date destroy's his own house, bites me, chases me in my car on foot like a total maniac through his neighborhood."
Is this okay for a girl?,"Would it be okay for a girl to approach a guy on the street/college? I feel like nowadays its not normal for people to approach others without it being on a dating app or online.


Also, if it is okay, what could I say? ""Hey, I think you are cute, can you give me your number?""? 


I am sorry if this is a dumb question but I have been in a relationship for a long time and am now entering the dating world."
Does anyone else find dating draining? (23F),"I find dating so draining, emotionally, physically, and mentally. Maybe I doing something wrong but I so tried of putting effort for no return.  Like everyone else I want the ""happy ending"" but I am tired of putting in the work for shitty people and just to have it fade into nothing.

I will say that I am serial online dater. I get dating apps chat with people, meet people, things seem great, but they just never work out. So I delete the app and go I am a strong independent women binge. Work on self and enjoy the single for a while it is great. But after a while it gets boring so I join the apps again. Only to remember how much I hate them. I am just tired of the dating game, I don't find it fun. All I want to do is skip to the end were I meet someone and don't have to date anymore."
"Ghosters, get your shit together",In the past year I have sent a few “hey I had a nice time but...” messages. THAT IS HOW SIMPLE IT IS. I have gotten a thanks for being honest message every single time. If someone reacts negatively to your honesty after one date and starts negotiating then by all means block and delete. But at least let them know you aren’t interested instead of just not replying.
how the fuck do i start dating?,"like. how do people even get started. yes i have tried expanding my social circle irl and online dating, but seem to be unable to even find interest in people. 
i get bored of people online really quickly and irl everyone seems to be just a passing fancy

when i interact with people, i’m very friendly and sociable. it just seems weird that i haven’t been able to have anyone interested in me. i know i’m not too bad in the looks area either (not model level but definitely up there)

i’m not scared of asking people out but i would like at least a small green flag before dropping the bomb on them (which i have not seen in anyone)

so, how do i start?"
I need some advice...,"I know this is going to sound like self-pity.  Believe me, I'm the last person that wants to wallow in their own misery, but I just don't know who to talk to.  If someone would be kind enough to read through this - I'd appreciate it.

(25 y/o M)

A little less than a year ago, I was not in the dating scene. I had my goals in place, and an idea of how I wanted to peruse my passions. I didn’t want a relationship, right now, and wasn’t focused on women at all. One day I call in to set up a haircut appointment before a black-tie event that I needed to attend. My regular barber is out. I need a haircut fast. So I go to this salon chain that’s around the corner from my place. I sit down, and I’m greeted by the most gorgeous smile I’ve ever seen. This girl is just the best. She’s beautiful, she’s funny, she has a great laugh. She has this glow about her that is beyond comprehensible. I feel strong and confident, and I feel weak and timid at the same time. All I know is that I want to get to know this person - and I’ve never felt this way about anyone.

We talked well after she was done cutting my hair (the place was pretty empty). Our conversation went so well, it was like we knew each other for years. Everything just felt right. She told me later on that her coworkers even asked her if we knew each other, after I left.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I haven’t been able to get this girl out of my head. I wanted to see her again. So I wait a couple more days for my hair to grow out, and go back in on the same weekday and time to see her, hoping that it was the right day and time to. Luckily it was; she was there. She cuts my hair, we have another great interaction and can’t stop laughing at one another. I tell her that I like to go out singing Karaoke at this local place on Friday nights, and that she’s welcome to stop by if she’d like - that’s where I’d be. She doesn’t. Normally I’d just throw in the towel and say there’s no way a girl like that could be interested in a guy like me. But something in me decided to hold out hope; maybe she couldn’t that night - She never said she would, but she also never said she wouldn’t. She said “I’ll think about it”.

I wait a few more weeks for another ‘haircut’ and give it one more shot. I try to play it off cool, and tell her not to worry about the last time; I’m there most Friday nights, and she’s welcome to stop by any time.

Friday rolls around and there she is - I greet her, and her friend that she brought along. We have a great time, and I introduce them to my buddy (a gentleman, with manners and a great personality to boot) who also likes to sing. He acts as my wingman so-to-speak, and I finally get her number.

Fast forward and we’ve gone on several dates. We stay up in her car a lot just talking until sunrise. She always asks me why I smile every time I look at her, and I give her the same answer every time: “I’ll tell you someday”.

Whenever I start to make my leave she grabs onto my arm and does this little whine like she doesn’t want me to. It makes me feel special.

Fast forward some more, and we are official. Everything is going well. We do things together like travel to Baltimore, go to parties, restaurants, cook together, movie nights, things that we both like to do, etc. She tells me that she loves me one night when we were out. She continues by saying that she knows that’s a lot to handle, so soon, and that I don’t need to say it back. I don’t; but I wish I had, because that was the answer to the question she always asked me. Why do I always smile when I look at her? It was because I love her - I had since the day I walked into that salon.

We have our minor disagreements and arguments, but I never wanted to go to bed upset. I told her that we don’t always have to agree on everything. I was always willing to admit when I’m wrong, and I was always prepared to swallow my pride for her.

One of our biggest humps to get over was her Ex - a guy that was seemingly still in the picture. The problem was that she’d been dating him for 6 years; and had only been separated from him for several months before meeting me. The two of them owned a pet bunny together, and it wasn’t able to stay with her, so it had to stay with him. This meant that she would occasionally have to go up to his place to visit her. While I knew about the Ex BF and the bunny, It didn’t alarm me.

Until one afternoon, I invited her out with me and my brother, and she didn’t get back to me. Something seemed wrong - she hadn’t texted or called all day. The place we were going was only a half a mile from her house, so I drove past to see that her car wasn’t there. ‘Okay - maybe she’s with her family, out late, I thought’. I send her a message saying where my brother and I ended up, and that she’s welcome to join us.

She finally gets back to me and says “sorry I was sleeping - maybe another night, have fun!”

‘That’s odd, if she was at home sleeping, then where was her car?' The air over the next few days is cold and tense, to say the least. She finally confronts me about it, and I tell her what happened. I don’t yell, I don’t accuse, and I don’t ask for more information - I just tell her that something isn’t adding up, and It’s got me upset. She tells me the truth - she spent the day with her Ex BF, and wasn’t sure how to tell me, so she lied.

I give her a hug, and tell her that I love her for the first time. I tell her it’s okay, and that I don’t want to seem possessive or jealous. He was a big part of her life for 6 years - she’s only known me for several months at this point. Who am I to tell her who she can and can’t spend time with? I tell her that If she needs to talk to her Ex bf from time to time, or see her bunny up at his place, then that’s okay - just be honest about what’s going on. Don’t keep secrets, and don’t be shifty.

Things go pretty well for a while, after that.

Unfortunately the bunny died about a month later, and I was heartbroken to see her so upset.

A few months later, another problem rears its head; one that many people in relationships have to deal with, is sorting out family life. I live at home currently, with my father, brother, sister and 1 y/o niece.

My GF had been staying over a lot, and it was beginning to worry my dad. Her clothes were in half of my dresser. Her jackets, scarves, sweaters and shirts hanging in my closet, her shampoo and toiletries in my bathroom. On occasion, dad would come home to find her at my house, even though I was still at work. Dad and brother decide to have a conversation about it with me.

I don’t put up a fight - it doesn’t seem like there’s much to argue. She’s a guest, but it seems as if she’s moving in. She hardly spends any time at her own home, anymore. When she’s not at work, she’s at my house. When she’s not at my house, she’s at her friends house. I don’t want there to be bitterness between her and my family, but I like spending the nights with her. Plus she’s gotten used to it - and it would seem abrupt to pull the rug out from her like this. Once again, I’m at a loss.

I try to talk to her about it, but as expected, there is resentment. She’s not happy, and feels that she’s not welcome, anymore. She starts packing her stuff up. I convince her to stop, and we talk for a couple hours. Eventually we come to the conclusion that maybe we should start looking for a place, together.  There's too many heads under one roof.  She doesn't want to have to interact with my family every night - we need our own space .

Jump forward a couple weeks, and we’re just trying to work out our finances. I have a nice little nest egg that I’ve been saving up for some time, granted having gone to community college has kept me out of school debt.

We find a nice little place with cheap rent, and it’s probably about as good as it gets. It’s my first time looking for places though, and I just figure out of caution, let’s just look at some more places. Other places are only more expensive, and in the constant chaos of every day life events, looking for places just seems to fall into the background, and we slip back into our normal day-to-day of going to work, her staying over, and the two of us going out on the weekends.

I continue to keep searching for places, but it starts to become less and less of a priority when I bring it up. In the meantime, we still have fun with one another, we still talk, we still laugh and enjoy each others company, and we still love one another. She asks that I go to California with her to see her best friend. I tell her I’d like to, but we should be saving up for a place to live. I succumb to her wishes though, and chip-in for tickets. We are to head out in April.

Fast forward to V-Day of this year. I have a fun night planned for us. She can’t do it because she has to work Valentines day, last minute. So I come up with other plans for the weekend, instead. We decide to go to laser-tag. It seems cheesy, but it’s actually a lot of fun. As I’m getting ready to pick her up from work, I get a call from her asking if her two co-workers can join us. I’m not jumping for joy over it, as I thought I’d take her to dinner afterwards, but I tell her “sure, if you’d like them to join us”. I try to interact with her co-workers/friends; I don’t want them to think that I dislike them, but the more I focus on them, the less focused I am on her. She gets annoyed - and our date doesn’t go as nicely as I wanted it to.

About a week later, it’s as if nothing happened; water under the bridge. We’re happy with one another. One day I get in the car with her, so that we can go shopping for my Niece’s first b-day party. As we’re driving, she says she want’s to talk. Long and sort of the conversation - she wants to break up.

After the breakup, she becomes distant; like I don’t even matter to her. She calls me when she’s bored, and when I start to tell her how I miss her, she tells me that she doesn’t have the energy to talk about this - and proceeds to evade or redirect the conversation. She says that she doesn’t understand why she wanted to break up. That it wasn’t me, it’s her. That “she’s the kind of person that wants something so bad, and when she finally gets it, she doesn’t want it, anymore”.

One night I’m at a wedding. I’m trying to get back to my old self. I get on the dance floor and do some cheesy line-dancing. My sister snaps it, and puts it on my story for me. A couple hours later, My Ex puts a snap on her story for the first time in a very, very long time. It’s of her at a university having fun with I guy that I don’t recognize. I become very upset. My lips start to feel numb, my heart starts to pound, my skin feels cold to the touch, but my insides feel like they’re on fire. I excuse myself from the wedding reception. When I get home, I can’t sleep. My gut feels like it’s rotting from the inside-out, and I have the worst sleepless night that I’ve ever had.

I get it touch with her, and she tells me who the guy was (a friend of a friend) and that she’s sorry if I took it the wrong way. I continue to help her with things whenever she calls. We spend a few nights together on and off, and then the Stay-at-home order comes onto effect. I follow it, as I have my Niece to think about. She decides to crash with her friend while her family stays in isolation. I tell her that she’s more important to me than money, so if she still wants to bring me along to California, I’d be happy to come, but she can bring whoever she wants. She says, “thanks”.

Fast forward to today. She does’t talk to me, anymore. No one does. My friend who helped me secure her number at Karaoke night doesn’t answer when I check in to see how he’s doing. Normally I’ll shoot him a text message every once in a while that says something like “Hey, buddy hope all is well, just seeing how you’re doing”. He always gets back to me within a day. He hasn’t contacted me in months, though. He’s probably my only friend, honestly. My brother doesn’t want to talk, because he has nothing to offer, and my dad tells me that her being gone is the best possible thing that could’ve happened to me.

Every night since she left has been worse than the last. Every night I get ready for bed, and dread falling asleep, because she’s in my dreams, and I feel fine for a while, but then she's not next to me when I wake up. I keep wondering how I could go so quickly from being “the most important thing in her life” to being no more than a fleeting thought. I tried my best to be everything she wanted in a person; I thought I succeeded in that mission, and tired my best to never stop. But now I feel like I’m being purged from her life - like a disease. 

Up until I met her, I’ve felt like I was on my own.
I’d go out at night with myself, and feel like the invisible man.  I’d put on a fake smile, and laugh; but I knew the next day that the only person to greet me would be the man in the mirror.  She helped me to drop the fake smile, and put on a real one - she made me feel like I existed.  


I don’t consider myself to be a very clingy person; and frankly looking at this objectively, that’s exactly what it seems like. I feel like somethings wrong with me, and I don’t know how to reconcile with the fact that she’s still the most important person in the world to me. Love is not a climb, it’s a fall.

I fell in love with someone who doesn’t love me, anymore. I don’t know what to do. The rug was pulled out from under me, so quickly.

I’m angry with myself, I’m sad, and I’m very alone.

But more than anything I just love her, still. I miss her smile. I miss her laugh. I miss the tint of yellow in her blue-green eyes; It’s like a sunset over the ocean.

Every day I wake up and wish I hadn’t.

When I was a kid, we had this art project where we had to draw a monster with a “have you seen me?” Bio on the back; like a missing child on a milk carton. On the bio, you were supposed to explain your monsters hobbies, interests, where they like to spend their time, and who they like to spend their time with, etc. in hopes that they will be found. The monster was supposed to reflect yourself, obviously. Other kids were then supposed to guess who’s monster was who.

I drew a monster - I don’t remember much, but I remember he was black and blue, with silver eyes so he could see in the dark. He had wheels for legs, and walked on his hands. He lived in a dark place. He had no friends, and I remember his bio saying, “no one will ever find me”. 


My art teacher read these aloud to the class, and when she got to mine, glanced through it first, then frowned slightly before setting it aside, saying “I don’t want to read this one”. It was so crushing for some reason. It was like that was my opportunity to be found, and I was turned away.

I’m feeling a lot like that, again.

I don’t know who to turn to, on this one."
Advice to those that are facing the same.,"Biggest lesson I’ve learned this year is that you can’t force someone to properly communicate with you & work things out. You can’t force someone to see your love is worth holding onto, eventually they will come to the realization themselves. If they want to run, let them run."
I think I finally found a girl I with mutual attraction after 36 years on earth,"Hey,

I have been single all my life, 36 years old, after years of dating with no real connection, both from online and offline I think I finally found a girl that I like and that also liked me. We felt a mutual connection right from the start and still dating now.  I have just been spending most of my time on interests such as art, business and self-development, etc that I have never felt the need for a relationship.

Just sharing my 2 cents. never give up."
"Girls' bios on every other dating app: ""Don't just say hi, that's boring."" Girls messaging first when on Bumble: ""Hi""","I'm actually interested in this phenomena, especially if it's not just me?"
"I (25F) approached a random guy on the train, told him he was cute, gave him my number; here's the real life account of what comes after","So, a recap: about two weeks go I posted on this subreddit [a simple question aimed at all men - how would you react if a woman approached you in a public space and gave you her number?](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/eqtj6e/men_in_this_sub_how_would_you_feel_if_a_woman/)

At the time, I had basically been faced with this situation: a really cute guy caught my eye on the commuter train, and I really wanted to approach him. Because I'm painfully shy and felt unable to make great conversation with him/couldn't stand the humiliation of being so publicly rejected, I took a post-it and wrote my number and a flattering little message on the paper. I held it in my hand forever trying to pluck up the courage to approach him, but he ended up hopping off the train before I had the chance to do it.

I instantly regretted not doing anything about it, and I promised myself that if this ever happened again, I would just. Do. It.

Fast-forward to today. I'm on the commuter train. Yet another guy shows up, and I have the same instinct - he's attractive, he's cute, I'm feeling him. I'm looking at him for a while with my sunglasses on, biting my lip and thinking ""Should I really do this?"". At the end, I just think ""Fuck it, what's the least that can happen?"". So I reach in my wallet for the post-it from two weeks ago (hey, might as well re-use it, right?), walked up to him. He was sitting down reading a book. I just said ""Hey, I have something I'd like to give you"", smiling; he just stares at me, surprised, at say ""Oh, thanks"", and takes the paper. I walked away immediately, so I'm not even sure that he read it or looked a it. By the time that I look behind me, he's opening his backpack and throwing the piece of paper inside. He looks at me with this dead serious look on his face, no smile, and proceeds to keep reading his book.

I eventually hopped off the train before he did, feeling absolutely defeated, disgusting, ugly, miserable. I mean, he was nice, he said thank you, he didn't do anything wrong per se. But I guess I was hoping for a more enthusiastic reaction, and his ""I could kill you"" look really demotivated me.

For a few hours I just kept thinking ""Well that's it, you're clearly unattractive and unloveable, might as well just forget about dating altogether"". But then again, I should be proud of what I did; I took a chance by putting myself out there and did something I never thought I could do. It gave me this strange adrenaline, my heart was beating so fast! His response was quite negative, a lot more than what I thought possible, but I'm trying to be positive and I'm still proud of myself. And hey, maybe some day some guy on some train somewhere, wherever I end, will actually make good use of my number, right?

So, TL;DR: followed people's advice from a few weeks ago to approach people on the train. Ended up getting deadly rejected, but that's okay, because I felt a strange rush I hadn't felt in years. Doesn't matter if the world thinks I'm ugly or fat or whatever, it still made me feel alive!

UPDATE: wow, I did not expect these many responses; I just woke up this morning with so many kind words and interesting thoughts/opinions from you guys. I will definitely be replying to everyone here once I get going with my day. Thank you all for the support and good vibes! <3"
"Yes, I have a full, interesting, busy life on my own. I am still allowed to not like being single.","Went out with my friend and her boyfriend last week and made a comment about how I haven’t had a date in a while.

"Im 26, and I feel like I'm running out of time dating wise"," 

I've never been in a serious relationship, now I've ""talked"" to guys on dating apps, but it hasnt gone anywhere because guys have been too forward with me too quickly, or the conversation hasnt gone anywhere. So I've given up on dating apps temporarily, mostly because of that but also because I am moving sometime in the next 6 months, and I dont really want to do long distance for my first relationship. Not to mention, I'm not a huge fan of the people in my area for various reasons. I also dont feel like I'm attractive to men out there, unless it's on dating apps. I moved back home the year after I graduated, and I live with my mom currently working for the family business.

Anyways, I see people my age getting married, or in relationships. and I've wanted to be in one for a while. The majority of my podcast group either are in serious relationships are married. But I know now is not the time for me to consider getting in one, however I also still feel like Im running out of time if that makes sense, especially since I'm closer to 30 and haven't had a successful relationship yet.

Honestly any advice is appreciated, really."

Tell me about that time when you did an absolute brilliant save on a date that was becoming a disaster.,"Just curious about other people's story. 

Here's mine. I was on a date with a girl and told her a story about my grandfather and I shared this joke he once told me about a specific town in the region. He used to say that the cows from that town were prettier than the women. I laughed and looked at her and she looked irritated. I asked what was wrong and she said ""I'm from [that town]."" I was like FUUUUCK!!!!!!! So after a few awkward seconds of absolute silence, which seemed like an eternity, I said ""well, they must have the best damn looking cows in the world"". Against all my expectations she laughed and we had a lovely date."
Seriously about 95% of the girls I’ve matched with on Tinder are selling something,Unless times have changed significantly the app is worthless
Dating is such a joke nowadays. Apologies for the rant! Not trying to discourage anyone but I take breaks from dating and it doesn't get any better trying again.,"(28 M) here. There's nowhere to meet anyone. It's apparently unacceptable to ask someone at their work. Online dating is just for hookup fuckbois and girls for the most part (please don't be offended, just the people I have encountered on there). People just wanna be friends when you finally land the date or you get ghosted completely. 

I mean why bother!?! It's too far gone now. I have landed several jobs, cars ect. in the time it takes me to find one good person to date. I'm done dating for good now. It's a lot of work connecting with someone, it's time and patience I really don't have when it never works out. I would be willing if it worked out, but it never does. I absolutely love how family and friends don't know anyone single ever either. It's really easy for some people, and unbelievably frustrating for others. I'm not blaming other people, it's just not fun dating anymore."
I’ve been off dating apps for 3 months and...,"I’m 23 year old female, and I had been on tinder and bumble for a little over 2 years. Now, I wasn’t very active, but there were days and nights that I was bored and wanted someone to talk to. No harm in that.
But, once I graduated I started to realize I wanted more than just casual conversation; I wanted to find love. 
So I deleted Tinder. I mean, it’s just creepy guys anyway right?
But I kept bumble because it seemed like the way to go. I would talk to multiple guys daily, sometimes we would even exchange phone numbers and snapchats. Some of the guys were douchebags, some were genuinely nice. 
Out of all the guys I talked to, I only met 2 in person. Now, I did get asked on dates, but then most guys would cancel the day (one time the hour) before. 

Online dating for me was a never ending “talking” phase. People wanted to talk daily, but never wanted anything to go past a screen. I had fights, anxiety, even tears over some of these guys.

I was having relationship problems without being in a relationship .

You may say that speaks more to me and my personality rather then there’s, but I think it shows what online dating really is for different people. For me, I was looking for a relationship. I was looking for “the one.” While many guys were looking for “the one...for right now.” They we’re looking for a distraction, not a commitment.
I would complain to my friends saying “no one wants me,” and i had data to back it up. Guys would ghost me, use me, drop conversations, and it felt like I was undesirable.
 
Finally I decided enough was enough. I deleted Bumble. I was free ... so I thought. 

The first week I felt like I was on withdrawal. Who was I to talk to? What if that one cute guy messaged me back and now can’t get ahold of me? What if, what if what if. Those two words rang in my head daily. 

By week two I had started to notice that there were men around me that were nice and caring, but I still was tempted to re download the app because checking it had become so routine. 

By the end of month one I felt completely free. I felt a new found sense of confidence. If a guy really wants to be with me, he’ll ask me out. I’m worthy of being chased and I’m tired of chasing. 

By month two I had started to see my life rebuild. I was putting all the energy I had reserved for boys and put it into my relationship with friends, family, God, and myself. I started creating my own affirmation instead of looking for someone else to give it to me. I even was asked on a few dates with guys I met IN PERSON. 
I guess I realized that I’m special and I should be treated as such.

Now that I just finished my third month I feel like I should get a sober chip or something. Online dating/constant affirmation is addicting. It’s so easy to make virtual boys have power in your life. 

I still feel lonely sometimes, but the difference is I know I’m not alone. I know that these temporary feelings are just that: temporary. 

A right swipe won’t fix them, and that’s okay. 

I just wrote this to share my story and to encourage a young woman or man today. If you feel like a dating app or website is bringing you stress, lowering your self esteem, or gives you anxiety, I challenge you to 2 weeks free of them. 

It’ll be hard, but I can safely say it’s the best thing I’ve done for me, myself, and I."
"Cant be bothered talking?, I cant be bothered paying.","In my early to mid 20s (basically around 1999 to about 2006) I never seemed to have a problem getting dates and picking up women  (unlike now where I regularly have to blow the dust off my cock), but this one really stands out.  


Met this girl one night, we hit it off, exchanged numbers, exchanged texts etc etc (this was the era when smartphones were just becoming a thing). We ended up arranging to meet for a meal, ""great!"" thinks I, but no.  


Turned up at the restaurant  we had arranged to meet up at about half an hour early, there was no need to book tables etc as it was one of those places where you just turn up and wait for a table. 45 minutes later im still stood there, so I texted her to see if there as a problem, she replied with an apology as she was running late, ok, no problem. She turned up about half an hour later and we finally sat down, ordered and got drinks in etc.  
All sounds ok so far doesnt it?, well, the alarm bells started to ring when I tried a few times to start a conversation, but got only monosyllable answers in response, or just plain old grunts,due to her sat playing with her phone.   
Starter had been consumed and main course had just been plonked down, and by that point i was beginning to think she had forgotten how to string a sentance together, well, until she shouted a waiter over and ordered another bottleof wine for herself, this time picking a bottle which was a fair bit more expensive than the type she had been drinking at the start, and all the time she NEVER put her phone down, and to add insult to injury, as the waiter brought the wine over, he said something like ""good choice"" to which she replied ""hes paying so I hope it is"".  


At this point i was somewhat pissed off and getting tired just from watching her thumbs wiggle about over the keypad, so I finished my main course and excused myself to go to the gents, dunno if she actually heard me, as i didnt even hear a grunt in response.  


Took me less than 3 minutes to have a piss, pay for my part of the bill and nope the fuck out of there.  
Got a text from her about 2 hours later containing various names and expletives for ""leaving her to pay"", i replied back advising that she should ask her mobile provider for the money back, being as she was on a date with them more than she was me. Never heard from her again, cant say i was terribly disappointed.  


TL:DR, i met a golddigga in the early 2000s and made her pay her own way."
I've tried Reddit's dating advice for a year. This is what I've learned:,"About a year ago, I just got out of a long-ass relationship and wanted to date but had no idea how. So I read a lot of Reddit posts about dating advice. 

&#x200B;

The most common advice was, ""Go to Meetups or any social gatherings and make female friends"". This strategy was based on two things: 

1. Online dating sucks.

2. You can develop your friendship into a romantic relationship or be introduced to someone who is interested in you through female friends.

&#x200B;

So I tried the advice above for a year and found out, **this is not a good strategy.** I went to a lot of Meetups and I can tell you this, Meetup is overrated. However, I was able to make lots of female friends (I had to try so freaking hard), and this is where the strategy starts to show flaws. The chance of developing a friendship into a romantic relationship exists (low), but the problem is that it takes a long time to figure out if it's gonna work or not. It can take years. 

&#x200B;

You can't expect your friends to find your lover for you. Friends are just friends, you can't have another intention. You're on your own!

&#x200B;

So, what you should do? Here's my advice (and this advice is also coming from my female friends). Don't try to be a friend. **Just ask out for a date within 1-3 meetings**. And move on. I know it's really awkward and embarrassing. But this way you don't waste your time. You can increase your chance of being accepted if you build a good friendship with that person, but again, it takes too much time. And the chance is just a **slight difference.** You can ask dozens of people out for that period of time. Do the math. 

&#x200B;

I agree that online dating sucks. But look around you, most couples nowadays met through online dating sites. I know that the chance is very low, but it is what it is. **Unfortunately, there's no better way.**"
"I used to think that r/dating was for solid advice, but it's just a haven of horror stories, insecurities and pitty mongering.","Whether  people are aware or not, but this subreddit is depressing as fuck. Low self esteem cringeworthy stories and people who think  love  will fulfill empty voids.

Some of you want fwb or casual  and then complain and feel bad when a relationship is not the option. Or look for fun and then be disappointed when nothing turns out how it is.

The bottom line is simple. Some of you need to learn how to love yourselves first. A lot of you are insecure, unable to know what you want, but you're  quick to find someone  else because you're  lonely.

9/10 this leads to finding the wrong people to where you'll be back there again on here now asking  if the person in your life is good for you when they're  obviously  doing shitty stuff.
 
With all that said, yes there are exceprions to the rule here. People who take advice, people who wish to make a change and want better. 

Realize one thing  ladies and gents  you need to make a better you for someone else and they need to make themselves a better them for you. 

No matter how many dating apps you use and or delete or person you meet in person if your life is fubar you'll  never live to your optimum level.

Good luck✌"
I think it's important to figure out why you want to date before you start dating,"For the last couple months, I've made a half-assed attempt at dating. I think deep in my heart, I didn't actually want to date and knew that now is not a good time to date. I am already spending 80+ hrs working and studying a week, and there's just no way I can squeeze out time for dating. Recently in a moment of introspection, I realized that all the working plus studying in the last couple years have put me in a pretty bad place, mentally. I'm not depressed or anything, but I am absolutely burnt out. If I were a steak, I'd be well-done with a black crust. I realized that I wanted someone to date because I wanted someone for me to complain to and comfort me, but I also realized that I didn't have the time or the energy to reciprocate if my partner wanted the same from me. Also, since a lot of my friends are in a relationship, I felt pressured to do the same, but then I realized that while they work to live, I live to work. They're all pretty complacent with their careers (which is totally fine) while I'm more interested in gaining as much experience and making as much money as I can. Trying to date with my schedule would have been a disaster, and dating for the sole reason of not being left behind is pretty dumb. Thus, from the very beginning, my motivations to date were tainted.

What I really needed all this time was to find a way to relieve all the stress and do things that I enjoy. Thus, I started practicing yoga recently, and it's been rather incredible. It helped me with my hip pain that's been bothering me for the last year, and I felt very at peace at the end of each class. I'm also planning a trip to the UK, and my plan is to travel to two new countries per year. I've always wanted to travel the world, but I've been so busy in the last couple years that I haven't even left my home state (well except one trip to NYC for work). Essentially, I want to get to a place in life where I can get up every morning well-rested and content rather than scrambled and irritated. Only then do I think I'll be ready to date.

I think a lot of people view dating as a panacea to their problems in life, but this is almost certainly the wrong approach. Until you're in a good place in your own life, you're not really in a good place to date. Dating is give and take, and you cannot expect someone to care for your physical/emotional needs while you're in no place to provide either. If you're feeling stressed, lonely, angry, or anything negative, then that needs to be fixed first. Otherwise, people will see right through you and your problems, and most people don't want to handle that kind of baggage from the get-go. For example, in the past year, whenever I met someone new, I always found myself talking too much about my job to them because I was stressed and kinda turned a conversation into a personal therapy session. I was shocked when I realized that, and if I could see that, then others must have seen right through me. It's no wonder that I didn't make many lasting relationships in the last couple years. A lot of our misery comes from not being able to pinpoint our problems, and life isn't a romantic novel where a mysterious stranger transforms our lives from a shithole to Eden. If you are in a shithole right now, you have to figure out why you're there in the first place and then climb out on your own. Only then do we have a chance at Eden."
"We’re familiar with the idea that porn obscures one’s views of relationships, but I think rom-coms have altered my views of love and relationships!","As far as porn, many are probably familiar with the idea that it is not realistic and can give its viewers an unrealistic idea of what to expect during sex, or in a relationship. However, I think my love for rom-coms has altered my views of what to expect of men. 

I am realistic, but at the same time I think I may be expecting too much. I just love how in the movies, the men are chivalrous, kind, and caring, and will usually have something going for them. Whether it is they have established themselves in a good career, or they learn the error of their ways and excel at whatever it is they become passionate about. They’re usually somewhat attractive, and take care of themselves and aren’t afraid to come forward when they are interested in a woman. 

I don’t expect all of this, but it’s just something I love seeing in the movies, and hope to get something similar but not 100%, eventually. What do you all think?"
"After a 7-month long emotionally abusive relationship, I went on my first date with someone new last night and it was unbelievably wholesome.","So as the title says I was in an emotionally abusive relationship from late last year to earlier this year. My self-esteem and self-worth were extremely compromised and I was manipulated into believing that I’d never find anyone better who could “put up with me.” We broke up and I did a lot of work on myself. Started going to the gym more, eating better, went to therapy for a bit, developed a clearer vision for my future, etc. I put off dating until I started to love myself and value myself more. 

Fast forward to a week ago when I redownloaded some dating apps and matched with someone who I really felt I connected with. We went on our first date yesterday and had an amazing time. He was super respectful and we shared many laughs together. Although my self-confidence now comes from within and doesn’t depend on the opinions of others, he really boosted it. I have a good feeling about this and I just wanted a place to share how happy I am with my personal accomplishments and successes!"
How to cope with loneliness and desperation?,"25 year old male here. I'm a software engineer, so I'm an introvert by default. Unfortunately, I'm also rather shy, though I've been doing a lot better at coming out of my shell. My friends tell me I'm a catch, but I have very low confidence and self esteem, and after being single for four years now, it only seems to get lower.

During this isolation, in which I live on my own with my three cats, my loneliness (is killing meeee, haha) and desperation for a relationship are only seeming to get worse. Has anyone else been in a situation like this, aside from the isolation?

I do really want to find love more than anything, but I'm starting to give up hope. I guess this is just a jumbled mess on my thoughts, I'm sorry. This is basically how I'm feeling right now."
"It's hard not to feel lonely when everyone around you is in love, venting.","26 year old single guy here.  Just ended a situation with a potential partner from tinder, we haven't seen each other in almost a month after our 2nd date, and I got tired of waiting for her.  I'm confident in myself and my own value, I don't have issues with talking to women and all that jazz.  I'm content with being single, however, I'm actively looking for a relationship, and I'm sure all of us single people know, it feels hopeless.

&#x200B;

I currently live with my high school buddy and his girlfriend.  We all have a good relationship with each other, and its not awkward at all to live with them because they're both good friends of mine.  But there are times where they'll cuddle together and watch a movie, and I'll be in the other room, notice them, and start feeling like ""wow, it would be great to have that right now."".  Whenever the other comes home, they're always there to greet them, ask how their day was, and give each other a kiss.  Stuff like that is what I want out of a relationship.  I'm in a band with some other friends of mine, and they are all in relationships, one of them is married, another just became engaged, so on, so forth.  I don't have a lot of friends, but I'm very close to the people I keep regular contact with.  And everyone is in a freaking relationship.  Now, there's a lot of good and bad that comes with both being single, and being in a relationship, and I'm embracing all of that while I can.  But a big part of me wants to have someone to love.  I work at a retail store, I sell shoes, and I deal with couples very often.  Seeing some good and some bad relationships gives me perspective, but I've also never been in love, so I'm always asking myself, is it better to have loved, then lost? or to have never loved at all?  I've never a serious relationship, and while I'm confident that if I keep trying I will make it, but I also can't help but just feel nothing but hopelessness.  I see so many posts on this sub of others in the same boat.  I feel for you all, its so rough out there.  I tell all of my friends to not take each other for granted, because a majority of them met before tinder hit.  But dammit, I want a good and fulfilling relationship, I know I'll have to deal with some shit to get there, but I have so much love to offer and I want to share it with someone.  My friends say to keep your head up always, and I do my best, but its some days like this that make it hard, you know what I mean?"
Ending a A Relationship Is Really Hard,"I see a lot people who post on here about being broken up with, and I have been on the receiving end many many times so I know how it feels, but it's also really hard being the person that ends it.

I just ended a relationship with a girl I was only seeing for a month. It was due to incompatibility with how we dealt with problems. I like to deal with problems head on and discuss them to try and make sure there are no misunderstandings whereas she had an ignore it till it goes away approach.

Her feelings were much stronger than mine. After a lengthy text exchange we finally said our final goodbyes and it sucks knowing what I feel is self-inflicted and it really hurts me that she is hurting as well.

I ended it because there was a 6 month expiry date to the relationship anyway given that I'd be leaving the country soon and I felt like some of the problems we were having would keep recurring given our different approaches to problem solving.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I feel like crap. It is extremely hard, and I mean **extremely** hard, when someone is crying their heart out to you. No one enjoys inflicting emotional pain on people they care about. It's so hard to stick the course and not change your mind and give in and give it just one more try.

Breaking up with someone you care about is really difficult. It's why I never say anything nasty to someone during a breakup, whether I'm breaking up with her or she's breaking up with me, and luckily most girls haven't said anything nasty to me either."
"After years of online dating, I deleted all the dating apps in early January and now I feel SO much better!","I’m a dating app veteran of about 4-5 years. Long story short, they didn’t work out for me at all. Constant ghosting, flaking, and games. However the “grass is greener” mentality of online dating may be the worse part.
I deleted everything the first week of January and I’ve been so much more happier and stress free. 
I’d like to encourage anyone who is suffering from online dating fatigue to delete all their dating profiles (even if just for a little while), and relax for a few weeks/months. Or... just quit all together and go about finding somebody in real life! The choice is yours."
Update: I had my period while I was with the guy I was seeing during our first time together.,"He handled it like a Pro and a lot of you gave me the peace of mind that it was a bigger deal in my head than it realistically was. We had another date, I asked him out to dinner for “being a sweetheart and handling things so well”. The night went really well, ended back at his place and had one of those nights that just makes me smile while reminiscing about it. It was so intimate and I’ve never felt so adored. I think I’m starting to really like this guy.

EDIT: Should have been more clear. My period came unexpectedly that night and ruined his sheets. Apparently it happens more often than I thought."
So my date tonight was cancelled 30 mins before we met..hope your Saturday nights will go better than mine!,"I better laugh heh. Met this girl yest face to face, spent 2 hours chatting , I really enjoyed it, so did she (at least she said). We agreed to go out for drinks today. I confirmed 2 hours ago, and booked a place. 15 mins ago she said she doesn't feel like going out. Im like, you could have told me before! She asked if I want to go near her and have a short chat in my car with her. Im like .. No. 

Needless to say, Im moving on.

So yeah, that's my Saturday night gone.

How are yours going?"
"I’ve accepted that most girls my age (20M, almost 21) have quite a bit of experience with sex and dating","About a week and a half ago I got my first kiss and date EVER and it was great. I had been dying to feel what it was like to makeout with someone and I finally experienced it. 

During the date, she revealed to me that she had had many sexual and romantic partners and even asked me if I was a virgin. I told her the truth and she reacted well, even taught me how to kiss and makeout and it was fantastic. 

At first glance, she doesn’t look like the one night stand type of girl and when she revealed this to me, I was a little bit surprised...but not really. Sometimes I feel kinda alone regarding having little to no experience at this age but I’m starting to care less. After that night, I’ve just accepted that most women have had some experience and hopefully more girls are willing to teach me how to be a better lover."
Some stuff men might not admit (Serious),"A little long, but worth the read.

I think a lot of men forget that other men are *typically* very similar to them, I would even go so far as to argue that when it comes to day to day things, and dating, most straight men are pretty similar, or at least have similar experiences, even some of my gay friends can relate to the issues I and other straight friends have. If some men want to disagree or provide their own takes in the comments, I welcome them as long as they're civil. I'd also like to say that men who will use this to jusitfy abusive behavior can GTFO. I'm going to talk about unintentionally toxic behavior, and emotional issues.

Now, obviously we know that even today it's considered a faux pax for men to express their emotions. This is not a woman bashing post, but lets be real here, when girls say their want a guy who's open with their feelings, they usually have a specific exchange or circumstance in mind, both myself, my brother, and friends have had women, especially, but not exclusively, those who aren't dating them, or who are just in the talking phase, turn their backs when things got rough for the guy. I have *straight up* told women that I'm feeling kind of lonely or down, and been outright accused of trying to get in their pants, or been told I'm being dramatic, and yes, even to ""man up.""

Today's dating world has become so toxic for men, online guys match with a fraction of the women they ""like"", even the hottest dude on tinder will get less matches than an average looking girl. My younger brother is a genuinely good looking dude, I'd even admit that sometimes I wish I looked a tad more like him, though I am still confident in myself, that' s not the point. He made a tinder after his breakup, and his girlfriend did the same, in the first WEEK my brother had a few dozen matches, his ex, who was cute, but not a dime by any means had over 200. I had a similar experience after my breakup. My point is: women have a smorgasbord of choices, men have slim pickings, and don't even get me started about dating in public.

Personally I have luck sometimes, and that's they keyword, sometimes. To the guys out there, most of the men you see with a woman on his arm, or successfully flirting at a bar are likely having their ""sometimes"" that night, and I imagine when you've had yours, more than a few dudes looked longingly. The constant temptation of online dating, and being able to see ""other options"" has made it insurmountably difficult for guys, especially those who might have a ""normal job"" or ""average looks"" to hold the attention of a woman. And to an extent, can we blame girls for picking top shelf? I would if I could, but the reality is that I just want someone I feel a natural connection with, and I know for a fact men tend to have a lower bar, or more flexible standards. They're more willing to overlook flaws, while women have to truly love a man for this to be the case, I've definitely torpedoed my chance with one word or misunderstood sentence before, while a woman saying something questionable during a date might not even phase me.

Men, simply put, want physical interaction as much as anyone else. Not sex, but just a touch, a kiss, a hand to hold, and lot of men in our generation have gone months, maybe even a year or two since they've been able to feel even so much as a flutter in their heart about someone. Today it seems to almost be a rat race to see who gets the girl, and women wonder why guy's act like cocks when they're rejected, or if the woman loses interest. Yeah, some guys are ego-maniacal, but most are just lonely, hurt, and angry. It's true that men's ego's are easy to inflate, but that's not a bad thing! I cannot tell you how many times some flirty eyes have boosted my confidence, reassured me that I'm a good looking dude, and that I can approach people and start a conversation. It still happens, but seems punctuated by rejection and failure, and it puts dudes in a dark place. I've heard girls talk about how they wish men still approached them, but with all the toxicity online, and in the news with guys being (justifiably) accused of sexual misconduct, it makes considerate men second guess their approaches, or even the thought of chit chatting with the girl in the elevator, or sitting alone at the bar. And often when a woman does appreciate a man's approach, she puts him in a box, because she feels safe calling him her friend. Once again, not to suggest women are obligated, but there's almost a stigma nowadays against dating your friend, when IMO, and most guy's opinion, your SO should be your best friend.

I guess I'll wrap this up by simply saying to my fellow single men, we're all in this boat together. It's not unusual to feel sad or alone, and most dudes are trying just as hard as you to ""get the girl"" whether it be online, at the bar, or anywhere for that matter. And to the women, please understand that most men are *not* pigs, and that showing venerability really isn't a sign of weakness, but a sign of a man who truly just wants the most basic degree of human interaction. With so much going on in the world, and with all of us trying to build successful lives, I think we've begun to neglect the human connections. To most men sex is an acceptable substitute, but not the replacement for healthy dating life, and ""all we want"" is to feel the warmth of your body next to ours. We're soft, emotional creatures just like you, but it's society's views on masculinity that create a hard shell that might seem scary at first. I implore both men and women to give each other chances, make plans a week out, put aside things for a dinner date, and give people a fighting chances before going back to swiping. So much ugliness in the world could be solved if we just let love take root before ripping it out, or dashing it away.

Once again, I welcome comments/opinions, or your own experiences, just please keep it respectful, even if you disagree or object.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should just reiterate again, this is not some sort of indictment on women, or an anti women post, I have the upmost respect for women, but I also do treat them as equals, love/friendship is a two way street. I'm giving a man's perspective here, and perhaps providing some insight that *some* women might not have. The big keyword here is *some* I can't paint everyone with a broad brush, therefore I'm speaking in generalities.

EDIT 2: Any gay bashing, or saying that I am gay, should be gay, etc will be reported. The whole point of this post is to show that straight men aren't all emotionally dry beings, not a huge fan of the term ""toxic masculinity"" but if anything calling another man gay for opening up about his vulnerabilities is toxic and IMO indicates your own insecurities.

EDIT 3: WOMEN, please, by all means, give us dudes some advice! That's what this page is for. I'm posting from my perspective, but if there's some kind of holy grail we're missing, show us the way, it will make things a lot easier for all of us!"
Why cant people just be honest about not being interested in you? Instead they just lie and ghost...its so immature,"I went on a hinge date with a girl. We were having a great time. The next day, I call to ask to hang out again sometime and she agrees and says she needs to check her work schedule (works at a nightclub) and would let me know when she would be free. This is literally the day after when my city announced all bars/restaurants would be shut down lol...girl you aint working, the whole city aint working...but i just said sure okay hmu when you figure it out. 

I tried to start a convo the other day to just ask her to be straight up and im just completely ghosted. Like wtf man? Why cant you just be honest and say youre not interested so we can both move on....

I just started online dating this year so this is my first time ive been ghosted. Im glad i was always honest about not wanting to continue dating with the people ive met online and dated , instead of ghost them. Man it does suck to be on the receiving end...

I guess in the end i dodged a bullet. Anyone one does that crap is too immature for me to date."
Popular But Unspoken Opinion: Dating during the COVID-19 pandemic,"I've seen all kinds of posts about anxiety related to dating during this health crisis.  

No worries.  I've got you covered.  Here we go.

How to keep your emotions in check in the early stages of dating?,"
I’m the type of person who tends to fall fast and real hard for someone I like very early on. Sometimes I get way too ahead of my feelings and find it hard to keep my emotions in check. Lately, I find myself constantly checking my phone for replies from him and wanting to spending all my free time with him which I know is moving far too fast.

How do people keep their emotions in check at the early stages of dating? Please any advice or pep talk to help!"
Great first date this morning,"UPDATE 2: Guys!!! He responded to my text, said he liked me too, and that we should set something up soon. Thanks everyone! I will keep you updated. 

UPDATE: Wow, thanks so much everyone for your encouragement and feedback. You have me convinced that I need to initiate our next date. I plan to text him this morning and let him know I had fun. Any advice on initiating the second date would be appreciated. My schedule is going to get busy Thursday thru the first weekend in December, so I'm wondering if it would be too soon to suggest dinner one night this week. Thanks again :) This is my (27F) first time dating after a LTR and I'm trying my best. Really appreciate you all.

I just had a fantastic first date! Grabbed coffee with a guy I've been chatting with on and off for a weeks now. It was amazing. Now I know what a healthy date feels like. I felt respected and heard. I was interested in what he had to say, and vice versa. 

We work in similar fields, majored in the same thing in college, and share similar interests. We talked about travel, family, TV, work, and books. The conversation was great. We talked for about an hour and a half. I feel like we could have gone on talking all day. We both agreed that we had fun talking to each other.

I have no idea if there will be a second date. My plan from here is to sit back, reflect on how the date made me feel, and live my life. I think I'm going to let him take the lead on whether he wants to see me again.

The last guy I dated had a way of making me feel confused, desperate, and clingy. This guy made me feel like an interesting, valuable person. Even if we don't have a second date, it was a great, uplifting experience."
Ugh - please don’t follow this guys example >_<,"So matched with a guy on something called “Happn” and seemed normal at first. Sadly he turned into this guy in the space of 48h ....

Sunday night: 

Him: What's your shifts like during the week

Me: Fairly busy as we’ve got a lot on atm 😊

Him: Alright, enjoy

Today - 

Him: Not to be person but I get put off by bullsh*t

Me: I haven’t bullsh*tted you but have been busy. I did explain this and I apologise for any miscommunications on my part

Him: I think someone needs punishment

Me: I’m not into negging or mind games. Sorry but that’s how I feel

Him: Same here but generally delayers are flakers

Him (literally 30 seconds later): You've got kids dont you

Me: No I don’t have kids thank you very much. I have a career that’s more important right now. That and my Nan was severely ill last month with an angina attack. Over the weekend I was out with family celebrating my uncles 70th birthday and this week I have a sh*t ton of meetings - it’s a busy time for my work.

Him: Lol the massage is on the house then. You need it

Me: I have a masseuse for that paid for by my boss

**********************************************
Honestly don’t get people like this. My profile doesn’t mention kids nor do I have them so no idea where that came from. Whenever he messaged I replied. If I was busy I would say so and that I would reply as soon as I can....

Yup dodged a bullet there guys

Edit 1: To clarify the messages above are from WhatsApp and on the actual app I had stated I was free on weekends (with the exception of this weekend just gone). Also wasn’t expecting work to pick up so quickly when I downloaded the app. The negging comment was from a previous question of his which I had forgotten to include - he asked for my opinion on it/if I was into it. 

Thanks for all the comments and advice though!"
Guys who don’t text,"I’m going on a 3rd date with a guy who doesn’t text as much as other guys I’ve been on dates with. 

He seems really sweet and a little bit shy (we haven’t kissed) but I do like him.

He texted me after our second date and said he had a good time. He said he’s going away for a week for a vacation and he’ll text me when he gets back to hang out again. He texted me as soon as he got back and asked if I was free to get brunch on Saturday and asked how my thanksgiving was. I said yes, etc. so we will meet up then. 

But he doesn’t initiate other texts about anything else...is that normal? I know he is interested. He has read receipts on his phone and he takes hours to read texts but does reply right away usually.) Maybe he’s just not a big texter or just doesn’t use his phone a ton?

Update: unfortunately, the date didn’t go to well. We had a good conversation but again no kiss or any chemistry. He seems really shy. He didn’t even walk me home even though I live like 5 mins away. He doesn’t seem interested in a romantic relationship."
I (26F) just had the perfect date with my teenage crush of 12 years. I am stunned.,"Hi everyone,

I am still in awe of what just happened. I just had an almost out-of-body experience with my teenage crush - as silly as it sounds. My story sounds like it came out of the cheesiest and most insane rom-com but I wanted to share with you all because I wanted to say: DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

I had a crush on this guy since I was 14. He was the classic looking-cute kind of guy that you check out at the same ""spot"" every weekend or so, where all the kids hangs out. I was obsessed with him, I would drool everytime I'd see him with his friends - I thought he was the coolest guy I'd ever seen in my life. We never got to talk, I was super awkward with not a lot of experience and I was freaking the fuck out whenever he was near me. You know, very immature kid-dy stuff. All my friends would know about him but nothing ever came out of it. I stopped seeing him after high school.

Fast forward 7 years, I bump into him in a party. I was with a couple of friends from school and when I told them he was at the party, they got even more excited than I did. We were a bit drunk and my friend kind of pushed me his way (embarrassing, I know) and we started talking. He seemed interested right away and he was asking me very genuine questions and I was so impressed. Also was dying inside. He asked for my number and then left fairly early because his friends were leaving. Next day he did message me and asked to hang out but at the time I had just started being with someone else so I felt bad and cut the conversation short. He was still THAT guy and I was of course disappointed over it but at the same time I found it very rewarding (for the sake of my 15-year-old self) so I got over it.

Now fast forward 3 years, I am newly single and got together with the high school friend I mentioned above. We got drunk while catching up over high school and reminiscing about everything. She prompted me to message this guy. I did and he responded right away asking where the hell did I remember him. Long story short we start chatting again and we now live in different countries so he's asking me when I'm going back. I told him and he messaged me the day I got there.

We arranged to go for a date and I have never felt so nervous in my life. I wanted to throw up beforehand it was so bad. I would finally go out on a date with the guy I'd spend so much time on in my high school years. He was a profound part of my life at the time (as silly as it sounds) and now we're here. I don't know how I pulled through but I showed up. He was great. Conversation was effortless. We hit it off right away. I caught myself being so confident and charming and just everything I never thought I was - he was clearly infatuated with me from the get go too. A lot of compliments, a lot of touching, we scrapped the small talk and started talking about ""deep"" topics right away and towards the end he was like ""The way you talk about things freaks me out because it sounds exactly like me"". I had no idea that on top of him finding me interesting and beautiful, we also both felt like we had so many things in common. It was a surreal moment. I never knew much about this guy - he was like a celebrity to me, someone you don't know much about but you freak out over them regardless. Him telling me so many wonderful things and sounding like a great guy is something that I would love for every single one of you to experience. I couldn't believe this was happening to me. What comes around...

We kissed throughout the night and it was amazing.  Everything was what the 15-year-old me was dreaming of and more. We are now seeing each other soon because he's going to come over to my country soon. I know this isn't going anywhere, we are thousands of miles apart and it's virtually impossible to sustain anything like this but the dream came true and it was incredible to see that sometimes ridiculous Hollywood scripts do come true. 

My advice to all of you if you are on a similar boat with someone is go for it. There is nothing to lose and the universe might already be plotting in your favour (also your friends!). Dating can be such a wonderful experience if you find the right person at the right time and who knows where the night will take you.

Be a dreamer, be bold and take risks."
Dating virgin,"So...4 recent dates. 2 were duds, 1 was effortlessly fun and sparky, and the latest 1 was nice. 

Effotlessly fun one- chatted on Bumble for a few weeks. A+ banter, personality and cute messages. Met IRL and we seemed to click right away, didn't feel awkward AT ALL, had a good time. There was chemistry and I knew I liked him because I wanted to TOUCH him. Nice eyes, hands (good sign!), thighs. After the date, he asked in one of his last messages if I wanted to see him naked. I replied saying I like things a little slower, but had a great time. Messaged died out. Really liked him, and imagined us having sex, but needed a bit more than 2 hours. Not a bad guy, but looking back, can see he doesn't have the emotional availably for a relationship right now.

Latest guy, exchanged 20 messages in 2 days and met up for a drink. He was nice, but so chatty that I didn't have a chance to ask him many questions and it didn't allow for banter, it was conversation heavy. He said I was very quiet, but nice. He asked if I'd want to meet up again and my intentions. I said a boyfriend, and he was sussing out if I'd be interested in something causal.

Yes, I want love and a relationship, but I'm also ready for sex - emotionally, physically, mentally. But I need a bit of emotional connection so I feel safe and can enjoy my first time. Like, maybe I don't even need the first guy to be my boyfriend, but I'm not ready for sex after 1 date. If I like them, should I be saying I'd be okay with something casual if I got to know them a bit? That probably doesn't sound very casual.

Catch 22 - you want to be fun and flirty on dates so you can see if you have chemistry and click - but this leads people to ASSUME experience because most 23 y/o have had sex. But if I hold back, not super flirty, they seem to think I'm too quiet/disinterested. But hey, he assumed experience anyway. I'm just trying to be careful, have fun. I'm not TRYING to lead people on. 

Casual sex seems to be popular and that's COOL, but this virgin needs a minute. Is this like trying to find a needle in a haystack?"
"Ladies, what were some of the best questions that were asked to you on a date?","What were some questions that the man asked you that you absolutely loved it was like “that was a great question”

Or maybe a question that ended up allowing both of you to share some cool stuff about yourselves?"
How can I get a boyfriend when I'm a girl who isn't feminine or attractive?,"I know who I am, and what I'm comfortable with. I'm a girl, and I don't enjoy being feminine or showing off my curves or wearing anything feminine, putting on makeup etc. I am by definition a tomboy. I lift weights for my strength training, and compete in boxing and I have a short haircut, as well as a muscular physique. Before I cut my hair short, I actually looked like a woman, but now I'm told I look like a dude. How can I find a boyfriend with all of this? I know that I don't want to change any part of myself, and as much as it sucks, men aren't attracted to women like me."
Any woman out there who feels that flying solo for the rest of their lives seems much more pleasant than having relationships?,"I'm in my mid-twenties. Have dated seriously a few times, put everything I had into the process. After a while, I always reassessed the situation and asked myself what I got out of it. The answer always is very little, other than sex. 

My life, when I'm single, is very pleasant. At this point, I'm seriously questioning the values a relationship, no matter how trouble-free, would bring into my life."
"Stop fucking telling me to ""lower my standards""","Like real shit stop telling me ""oh youre aiming to high go lower""

&#x200B;

Honestly? No I will not lower my standards. I want be with the best possible partner and be happy and content with them instead of someone lower that im just ""Ok with they'll do""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I want me a woman that will treat me with geniune kindness and respect someone to chill and hang out with and will dominate me silly in the bedroom?

&#x200B;

Is that aiming too high? Oh fucking well and if i dont get that. I'll be fine on my own because im not just gonna end up with someone that im not content with cuz my ""standards are too high"""
You should stop being afraid of expressing boundaries,"Its hard to get over I know, but in the end expressing your boundaries is only going to help you find someone you’re compatible with quicker. 

I used to feel like I wasn’t allowed to express discomfort over certain things because my partner would get upset with me. That’s not a cool feeling! You should be able to tell your partner, “hey that actually makes me really uncomfortable.” If they get upset or disregard your feelings you will know they aren’t right for you."
Anyone else never been in a serious relationship?,"I’m a 25 female. I’m happy with myself and my life but do get lonely at times and feel like I’m really missing out on having that romantic partner in my life. I know it’ll eventually happen for me but I feel like I’m inexperienced when it comes to relationships when I compare myself to my friends and other people my age... I’m also nervous that when a guy finds out I’ve never been in a relationship, he’ll judge me for it and think that there’s something wrong with me haha. 

Anyone feel the same or have any advice?"
Word of advice for mothers on dating apps,"I don't know if I am the only guy who feels this way, but if you are a single mother please don't only put up pictures of your children. Whether that be of your human children or fur babies (as I've heard them called before). While I have no qualms with being in a relationship with a mother, it can be quite off-putting when your profile is filled with images of your children and little to none of you. It's also a little weird ""liking"" a profile of nothing but 5 yr olds...  One or two images of you with your children is perfectly fine, but please have some in there of just you as well."
A PSA to every guy who is starting to get frustrated,"A friend of mine who is 30 and has never been in a serious LTR sent me a screenshot the other day of his exchange with a girl he knew from work and was setting up a first date with. He wanted to know if he was ""getting played.""

For whatever reason she wasn't very communicative and the date day had passed. 

His responses were short and annoyed. Asking ""When we seeing eachother?"" her responses were simply side stepping his questions and his responses got more and more frustrated. 

My advice to him and to every guy experiencing something like this is:

1) You need to completely reframe why you're talking to women in the first place

2) If a girl is acting flakey, ESPECIALLY before a first date, just move on and whatever you do, **never** show frustration.


Re number 1, I've been in a couple LTR's (6 and 3 years) and I think generally speaking my goal is to make a connection with a girl who is interesting. Obviously I need to be attracted to her too and obviously sex is on my mind if that's the case, but my main goal is not to get laid as soon as possible and I think the lack of desparation is obvious to my dates. 

I've been trying to understand what I've been doing right these last few months as my dates have been pretty successfull. 

It's 100% what you value. I place a lot of value in building close relationships with people in general, especially with women.  

If a woman isn't interested in that, with me, I move on because why would I waste my time forcing something that can't be forced? 

So ask yourself, what do I actually value in dating, what am I truly looking for? And if that person doesn't seem to align, move on.

Curly hair=Attractive?,So i know some girls go crazy about guys with curly hair but do guys feel the same about girls with curly/wavy hair?
I went on a date this weekend. Holy shit I dodged a bullet,"We matched on Tinder and we were having fun, nice talk. We exchanged numbers and set up a coffee on friday.

When we met we started talking about stuff, I've noticed she didn't have much of a filter for topics to talk about. At the first date she:

* Said her friend commited suicide. Gave details of what happened
* Is on heavy meds for depression and meds for sleep
* Talks about her exes, asks about mine and talks about other Tinder dates she had
* Emphasizes how she can't date fat dudes (ironically her weight isn't ideal either)
* Has expressed prejudice against LGBT

&#x200B;

She asked to go out again in saturday and I gave the benefit of the doubt. Confirmed everything on the next day

On sunday I was definitely not ready to talk with her. Thank the gods (airhorns) I found out she blocked me."
I just want to be kinky and f**k but only w/ someone I really like and can be in a serious relationship with.,"rant- UGH just fuck me but also cuddle me for hours. kiss me softly but also make out with me all the time. et cetera. i recently decided to stop “trying” to get find a good guy (because i’m always disappointed), but i’m still open to them conveniently falling into my lap. WHY is this not happening to me?? is it really that hard to fall in L❤️VE?!?!"
The height thing,"The general thing on reddit seems to be that a lot of men have issues when women ask about their height, because apparently that's a selection criteria for some women and they only want tall men.

I can imagine it being frustrating. 

But men seem to portray it as if height 'discrimination' is a thing only women do.

I'm 180cm, so I'm a tall woman. I don't discriminate in height, most of my boyfriends were shorter than me. 

But I lost count of how many men in OLD have told me that I'm just good to fuck because of my height, but not relationship material. That I'm a really interesting person and attractive but they can't have a girlfriend who is taller than them or would be taller than them with high heels on. Then they wouldn't look 'man' enough.. 

So, if it could be of any consolation, the discrimination goes both ways. :) 

And to be honest, I don't even care that much. I want a confident boyfriend, someone who isn't superficial or has a fragile ego. So my height is already a good filter to help filter part of the fragile egos out. And I assume it's also the other way around. Why, as a man, would you want a women who places so much value on something as your height?"
How do people just..meet other people?,"So its as the title says, I(27M) have no idea how people just meet other people so easily. Like is it location? Is there something I'm too dense to get? 

I hear about all these success cases around me for both online and in person meetings all the time. Two of my best friends found their current partners through online services, and quickly at that. So maybe its that online profile wise, I'm boring or unattractive? Could be my crippling phobia of talking to someone I've never personally met before but hard to tell.

In person too though, I work customer service, I see people ALL the time. Sure, I'm not particularly looking for a match while I'm working, but even when I'm just out and about (quarantine not withstanding) I don't just happen upon others like I always hear about. So I'm more curious during this time of isolation (I work customer service though so It's not so much isolation for me), what sets those who can just meet people apart from others?"
First dates feel like job interviews to me now.,"I'm a 22 year old male, been on 28 first dates since I started at 18, the most recent was just today. We met for a quick coffee at noon. As soon as I sent the follow up text a few hours later I knew she'd reply with a polite rejection telling me I seemed like a nice guy but not thinking it would work out. And she did.

The thing is, I don't even enjoy first dates, not really. I kind of dissociate when I get there, it feels like a job interview, like I'm not there to enjoy myself or get to know another person, I'm there to get a second date. Then I go on a second date to get the third date, and the third date to whatever--it never goes past the third date.

Dating with the apps feels so artificial. I'm an introvert (surprise, surprise) and it takes time for me to be myself. All my close friends tell me it took a while before they felt that I actually liked them. It's just my nature which flies in the face of how most people expect an insta connection on first dates. Even more so when you're strangers on apps. 

I know I should take a break I have taken many breaks and I always crawl back to the apps, if not for the paucity of available women in my immediate day to day life, then to fight back my fear of dying alone or being a 40 year old virgin that's never been in a relationship. I feel trapped in s cycle of failure and I can't escape. I feel like I'm living my best life beyond dating--my research looks promising (in grad), I have a good position, I have a car, I'm fit, I'm as social as I can be. But I'm alone. And I hate it."
"I met someone I actually like, and have a mutual connection with, for the first time in almost 5 years.","We’ve only hung out twice so I don’t want to jinx it but I’m excited to see where things go and I needed a place to express this! I have a total crush on this dude and it’s going really well. I know I’m a total dork but thanks for reading this!

EDIT: Someone asked me to provide an update later and so I shall!"
Enough with the taco bios.,"Seeing all of these profiles in dating apps saying they love tacos, taco this, taco that, etc makes me think I just need to go hang out at the local taco shop to pick up dates rather than use dating apps"
This shit makes me feel hella insecure,"So 2 weeks ago at work I was talking to my co worker and asked her if we could go on a date together I knew her 2 years ago when I first started working here. She said “no, I’m a lesbian.” I immediately apologized to her “ I’m very sorry I asked” but just a few moments later I hear her and her friends laughing and pointing fingers at me saying and I quote: “he must be hella stupid if he thinks I’m gonna date his dumb ugly ass.”"
I QUIT on the idea of finding a romantic partner today. I ACCEPT being single forever,"So I am 27F and I am done trying to find myself love in the form of a romantic partner. I have so much to give so much love, care, compassion to give but I get friend-zoned or bro zoned every time. Guys will tell me you are the most genuine and loving person I have ever met, they will vent to me for hours but nope I am not marriage worthy.  I have tried with all kinds of guys, I guess my standards are too high for them. I simply demand basic human things. Communication, ambition, respect, humor, intellect to name a few but I guess that's too much nowadays.

So today I QUIT officially here which is to announce that I will be focusing my energies on living my life and doing great things. May be finding a romantic partner isn't for me. I am not made for this.

Rant over."
I think the one hardest part about not working out is wondering why you weren’t good enough.,"This especially happens when you see that she wasn’t into you or she breaks up with you and then short time later she’s with someone else.

You begin to wonder “why?” “Was I not good enough?” “What about him did she like that I wasn’t enough?”

Now of course this does not account for unhealthy relationships like abuse and all that stuff. I’m talking more about when a girl loses feelings for you or was never into you in the first place."
"Something I learned from my recent breakup, that I’d rather not forget.","We go into a relationship, beaming with joy and enthusiasm for the future. We don’t know this but we are subconsciously expecting this person to be exactly who we imagine them to be in our day dreams, in between steamy/funny texts and calls. We unknowingly place unrealistic expectations onto these people. We expect them to be someone that our mind has imagined up. Nine out of ten times, we don’t even have a clue as to who they really are. This is just one reason relationships fail. There are so many others. For a relationship to work, it needs to stand up to so many challenges.

When you do finally get to know the person for who they really are, keep in mind that you too have your flaws. No one is perfect and nothing in this world is perfect, so how could your significant other be perfect? Remember that only you can provide yourself with a love that is truly fulfilling. No other person can give this to you, so please stop waiting for and expecting it from your SO. Remember to stop focusing on the negatives of your SO and start focusing on the negatives you yourself are guilty of possessing. Remember to stop yourself from over analyzing small details that you know mean nothing in comparison to the big picture. Remind yourself to stop placing blame on others, ask yourself “what part do I play?” Every time you think of a bad experience with a significant other, ask yourself, what did I do to fix things? If you go around placing blame and pointing fingers, you have already lost the battle. Focus on yourself.

Some of you may already know this, but struggle with applying it to real life situations, like I do. It’s hard. But I hope the reaffirmation helps it stick."
Yesterday I was rejected in person for being too short,"I met a girl from tinder after a week of mon stop chatting. She was fawning over me.

In person, her first words to me was you're shorter than I expected despite me telling her my height on text and she saying she was fine with it. She told me she couldn't do this and doesn't want to waste her time and easy. She then apologised, said she can't do it and left.

I'm so distraught. This pain hurts so much."
It's okay to be desperate.,"Everyone wants to love and be loved. It is human nature to seek companionship. There is nothing wrong with being 'desperate'. Those who have the most love to give and want to give it the most are seen as the most desperate and those who are seen as the most desperate are seen as the least attractive. This is ass-backward logic. If you want someone who is going to treat you right, find someone who is desperate to be with you. Having someone be uninterested in you means they're not going to care about your feelings. People need to stop going after people who aren't interested in them. That's all I wanted to say, thank you for your time."
Idea: Popular dating apps should host speed dating events in major cities,"The idea would be that you have to sign up and maybe even pay a small fee, say $20. You get a couple of drink vouchers or something, these companies rent out a ball room, offer a bar and have hourly slots that you can sign up for.

I’m sure some sort of system can easily be created where 2 people who would like to see each other again can link up.

I personally would love this because it would be a controlled environment so women can feel safe and yeah there’s risks of sketchy people but no more than meeting someone from an app. 

It will also solve the problem of pointless conversations over the app, or matches flaking on meeting. Those who truly want to meet someone will show up!

Thoughts? 

I know there are already speed dating events in certain cities, but I think with a large population of younger people heavily relying on Apps such as Bumble and Hinge, it’d be cool if they hosted something. Obviously the requirement would be that you have a profile set up."
Compiling a list of the worst cliche reddit dating advice and assumptions,"* Everyone is assumed to be not trying and that you haven't thought to ""put yourself out there more.""
* While you're at it, ""work on yourself"" and ""focus on what you love,"" which is to say that anyone who can't get a date must be a complete trainwreck who doesn't already spend hours each week in the gym staying in tip top shape, being social, having interesting hobbies, having healthy habits, having a career, already having a great sense of style and grooming.
* If you stop using the Internet and go out and join some activity or group, you'll automatically meet someone right away because that's where all of these hidden gems of perfect matches have been hiding all along.
* You also haven't already thought of that and tried that a dozen times, and realized doing so was filled with people you weren't into, were not your age, and attractive people who have their shit together never join these kinds of things.
* Guys who aren't succeeding at dating *must* be coming off as desperate. That's the only explanation!
* All women have an endless line of suitors, all of whom are male models, and they never feel lonely or sad with dating and hookups.
* If you say you're lonely and feeling down, someone who knows nothing about your life assumes you're clinically depressed and tells you that you need to go to therapy because heaven forbid anyone vent something that's not positive.
* Online dating works the same exact way for everyone, regardless of gender, location, race, and age, so if it's not working for you, ""there must be something wrong with you"" or that your profile must totally suck even though you have a Master's in Writing and are a professional photographer who knows their way around words and pictures.
* Just move and get a new job some place where there's more people. That will fix everything, even though you've already done that twice or more, and only found yourself among more people your age who are taken and married, so now you feel even more single than you did when you lived in a smaller area.
* You got ghosted because the person wasn't that into you or they met someone else who was ""better"" than you, and not because the other person was a sociopath and emotionally abusive.

Any more? Add them below!"
I DID IT!!!!,"I DID IT!!! 


I finally asked out the girl that I’ve been crushin’ on. 

Unfortunately she did say no, but I’m still glad I asked because now I know for sure what her answer is.

In a way it’s kind of a relief or a feeling of closure. Now I can focus on other things, and if another lady grabs my attention, I’ll go from there.

I know objectively this isn’t all that exciting but I’m glad I actually took a risk. "
Please dont AGREE on a date if you're clearly not interested,"Happened to me (F, 20s) a couple of times this month. In both ocassions, the guys agreed to the date, even sounded excited about it, showed up, and when they did they acted like they had zero interest and were forced to be there against their will.

This is stupid and a waste of everyone's time. If someone asks you on a date and you don't think you'd be into the person, just say so! ""hey you are a cool person but I just don't see that way"" is a much better strategy than ""I'ma show up and act fully uninterested the whole time so she gets the point.""

It's okay to say no from the get go. Please don't say ""yes"" just to be polite.

/Rantendshere

EDIT 1: Since a lot of people are asking this, I met both of these guys in real life not dating apps so there were no ""they didn't look like their photo"" surprises.

EDIT 2: I met both of these guys in 2 different weekend-long camping trips. So we had spend a considerable amount of time talking in a group setting. aka they had at least gauged my personality.

EDIT 3: A surprising amount of ""did they know your body type?"" comments. [Here's a pic from before my run this morning.](https://imgur.com/gallery/SjkdXlZ) Disclosure: all 3 people discussed in this post are huge gym rats. One of the dates took place at a gym."
It’s starting to become very clear to me that boyfriend material and hookup material are two different things,"Being boyfriend material is something that most guys can work on and have value as. That’s what all this bettering yourself pep talk is aimed at: to make men more confident and better providers so they can be better boyfriend material. As long as your personality isn’t absolutely awful, if you’re decently winning at basic life stuff you probably have some value as boyfriend material. Being hookup material is different. That’s more of a you have it or you don’t kind of thing. And a lot of men don’t have it. Men have much less control over that I think. It’s a roll of the dice and a much more difficult skillset to learn if you don’t already have it. So basically I think it’s frequently easier to be boyfriend material than hookup material.

So a lot of guys are boyfriend material but not hookup material. Which sets things up for a lot of confusion and frustration for these guys over why they are apparently not wanted when all the cool kids are hooking up all the time. Then eventually most of them get settled for. I think a lot of these are the original “nice guys finish last” type of nice guys. But it’s not that they’re nice. At least not entirely, maybe being overly nice factors into the issue. They just aren’t hookup material for some reason.

Basically these guys put up with a lot of disrespect over nasty valuations. It’s kind of fucked up

Edit: Apparently it’s necessary to say that I’m a man"
A few things to consider if you’re trying to step your game up.,"**Cooking.**

I’m definitely not a master chef, but women I have over seem to like it when I cook for them! It’s also loads of fun to have them involved in making the dish. I make sure to ask for feedback when I’m adding spices or ingredients, and I like to have them help out with chopping things up or other such things — that way the dish isn’t just mine, but theirs too. 


**Wine.** 

A nice wine selection never hurts. It’s a good way to take the edge off of any initial awkwardness if you’re just meeting them, y’know?


**Scents.**

If you’re bringing someone to your place for the first time, it’s good to have a pleasant smell to greet them when they walk in. I like to have little jars of spices and potpourri, as well as scented candles.


**Having a space of conversation starters.**

I like to make my room easy to comment on. This can range from having books on the nightstand, instruments laying out in conspicuous places, posters, that sort of thing. (Of course, I keep it clean and smelling nice too, but that’s a given.)


**A weighted blanket.**

This might sound corny, but it’s frighteningly effective — I have a weighted blanket, and I like to offer people a chance to try it out, usually after a glass of wine or two. I don’t think I need to explain this one.


That’s all! Hope this helps. :)"
A friend of mine showed me screenshots of her tinder profile MSG's...,"Holy moly... To be honest I was shocked by how disgusting and scary things can be for girls on tinder lol. I used to envy them for having 200 likes daily (this is my friend's rate)... 

Most of them are asking for sex right away which is good imo because at least they are straightforward and not playing games. Some of them are rude as fuck when u reject their sex offer. Others start sending you dick pics when u give your number to them..

Knowing all this should raise decent guys self confidence to be honest because at least you are not as cheap as most guys are ... So if a girl ignores you it's her loss..."
I told someone I like them for the first time in my life,"Yep I did it. 90% certain they don’t like me back but I did it anyway. I need to move on with my life and having this crush is not helping me whatsoever ahahahahah

I told him I liked him and literally left so now I have to wait for an answer - I know I’ll get one he’s a good guy. 

God I just want him to reject me quickly so I don’t have anything to think about anymore!

Edit 1: idk if you guys who commented get notified when I update a post but here’s what’s happened so far

Saw him Wednesday/Thursday in class and our relationship hasn’t changed at all! I’m a cuddly touchy person so he touches me a lot for instance on Wednesday if I needed help while working on the desktop, he’d come over and basically plop his arms around me to get to the desktop - he even put his head on my head.  Another time we were listening to a lecture and I was falling asleep (I was sitting in front oh him) when I rested my head on the back of my chair he picked my head up with his hand and put his arm under it. Thing is, we haven’t talked at all about this whole me liking him thing, and we don’t text much of at all (he leaves me on seen actually) and last Thursday I asked him if we could chat and he avoided it - but to be fair to him he could’ve been busy like he said idk.

Honestly I’m so confused. I have no idea what to think. I messaged him today to tell him we should chat on Monday at lunch at that lunch was on me. So hopefully all goes well. I’m pretty certain that if he was sure about me he’d have already said something, so either he’s unsure or doesn’t want to let me down.

I have contingency plans for both situations; if he’s unsure I’ll suggest we could try dating - no pressure, or if he’s not interested then I’ll ask him to be more wary when it comes to touching me and teasing me."
Maybe there really isn’t someone out there for everyone.,"[29F] here that has never had a boyfriend, and frankly have never even come close to being in a relationship. I tried online dating, I tried meeting people in person, I tried delving into hobbies, but nothing has come  of it, and I’m cripplingly lonely.
 
I had some progress earlier this year when I finally lost my virginity, but the guy I gave it to, told me I was special, but his life was too chaotic at the moment and he wasn’t ready for a relationship. So naturally, I took that as “I want to be in a relationship, I just don’t want to be in one with you.”

At this point it’s getting embarrassing because my parents are now stating that I should let them pick someone for me. And I even decided to delete all of my social medias because I couldn’t stand seeing all those around me getting into relationships, getting serious with someone, or getting engaged/married. Meanwhile, I’m still here, watching from the sidelines and panicking because surely everyone is laughing at me for being single for the past thirteen years.

Do you ever hate hearing “you’ll find someone.” ? Because frankly, I honestly don’t think that there is someone for everyone out there. Dating and constant rejection has made me numb. And the fact that I’m basically 30, and still haven’t found someone to love me, or even try to get to know me, brings me to tears. I’m tired, I’m feeling hopeless, and I’m trying my hardest to accept that some people are meant to get through their lives alone.

End rant."
Hilarious update,"So about a year ago, I posted about a Tinder date ghosting me after 2 great dates.  We had had sex, great chemistry, then all of a sudden she went super cold and stopped making an effort.  After a month of pursuing her, I gave up.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last August, where she texted me apologizing. At the time she had just been out of a 10+ year relationship and emotionally was fucked up.  She asked if we could go out again, now that she was ready.

&#x200B;

We've now been dating for 8 months and it's going well.

&#x200B;

You never know what's going on with someone. Chances are if someone ghosts you out of the blue, it has more to do with them and their life than yours!"
Dating for a beginner?,"What are some dating stages and what information should you share during those? 

I understand that it depends on how comfortable you feel with them, etc but I'm supposing there are boundaries. I.e. not sharing your whole life story on the first date, not asking them to move in after the second date, etc. These are extreme examples and common sense that goes for anyone you meet for the first time, I suppose but I'd specifically like to focus on dating boundaries. How long is casual dating and after how long can it be considered serious? I suppose it depends on if you've decided to become exclusive but is there an average timeframe? 

I've never dated before and would like to be mindful of it. 

Also please list the green, yellow and red flags for dating men and women. What are some things that you should discuss/talk about to find out if your views, goals, etc. are compatible? 

Also, after dating, are there relationship stages? If so, what are they? What are the boundaries? What are some relationship flags?

Sharing any lessons learned while dating /being in a relationship would also be appreciated.


Edit - Thank you for all the upvotes and comments. Although I understand that the experiences are different, follow your gut, etc. Please refrain from offering generic advice. 

Even if everyone has different experience, expectations, etc. I believe there will be a set of red/green flags or experiences that are common to most if not all. So please focus on sharing those. Imagine you little brother/sister that has never dated before is about to start dating and you're giving them pointers based on your experience. 

Thank you once again, kind strangers."
Be patient.,"Be patient.  Don't rush into a relationship, even if it takes a while to meet someone.. what's good will come to you.  :)"
"Guys who can't get dates, how do you cope with the loneliness?","21M Virgin here. My question is to others in my boat, how do you get over the feeling of missing out and being unattractive to women. It really sucks never having experienced cuddles, or holding a girls hand or kissing. It's always on my mind when I see other couples, and the medias constant barrage of romance and sex.

What's the best way to cope with the feeling of loneliness?"
Who should pay for the date?,"I’m a physician (35f) and have recently started dating. I’m of the thought that women and men should spilt the costs of dates. For instance, I’ve had them take me out and pay for everything and then I reciprocate on the next date. I was just talking to two guys at the hospital and they both agreed that men should pay for EVERYTHING in the early dating phase. What do you all do?"
Why is dating so shit nowadays?,"I don't understand dating anymore, it's so fucking confusing, it's beginning to turn into this like chore. I've been single for  3 years now, and for the entire 2019, i've been trying to find someone that is on Tinder or Badoo apps. Well ofcourse there are just those types of girls, which you think you hit it off very well in the chats, and when you suggest to go out they disappear. Getting random girls to go on dates with me wansn't easy, but I did go to alot of dates (I've gone out with like 20 girls) and I've just been so sad, because it never seems to go anywhere from the first date, either it's the classic ""i'm busy"" or you just get ghosted. It just feels like a routine at this point. At this point, you, the person who is reading this, will say something like: ""Dating shouldn't be a chore, and you're suppost to have fun"". How should I suppost to be having fun, when whenever talking to the other girl, they feel like, they have a gun pointing to their head, and don't share much about them?  I've been single for a long time, and I used that time to really find out what kind of person I truly am, what I enjoy, and what I need. I'm not miserable, I'm studying right now, have good friends, I enjoy making people, I love to cook and for hobbies I enjoy fixing cars, I don't get anxious when talking to girls, so I think i'm ready to be dating. Now, again, you the reader, will say something like: ""Take a break"". I did, like 6 times. I've reinstalled like tinder 6 fucking times, and still, theres nothing I found. I need real advice."
Does online dating and social media make anyone else real depressed?,"I know it's not real life

but i go on tinder and see so many unatainable beautiful women then go on instagram and see more of the same but also really good looking guys who owuld have no problem getting these kind of girls. Kind of makes me feel shit about myself and depressed"
Got stood up ... not even mad,"(22F)Talking to this guy(24) on tinder for a while, he was eager to meet . I was not cause have some issues.
We decided to meet today , but he didn’t show up . I waited for 3 hours called him but he wouldn’t respond. Was not even pissed cause I have this thought process , if it didn’t happen probably it was for my best .
Now chilling with my pizza and watching a movie .


Update: He texted me after 27 hours saying “ sry I got a heart attack , was at the hospital” “ ....hmmm ok .......and the pizza toppings were - sausage,jalepenos and corn"
"If you ask someone out and they respond with ""Thanks for the invite but..."", No matter what the reason that follows (even if it is legitimate) accept that they aren't interested in you.","I have had this response given to me a few times recently but when you read between the lines, although they may mean it when they say thanks for the invite, its just a generous way of saying ""you're cool but I'm not feeling the potential for ""us"" tbh"". All you can do is move on from them and find someone who is feeling it 👌

Okay so, funnily enough, a situation just happened which kinda contradicts a few of the replies to this post (not the post itself). If you are communicating really well with the other person and they write something like ""I am working/busy during [insert time] :)"" you can push to see if they are free another time. I just did this and even though the girl I am talking to (not the same girl in the original post) works till late, after a little push she suggested that she is fine to go out after her work shift even though it'll be pretty late. So ultimately, even if they don't immediately suggest an alternative time, don't immediately assume they aren't interested but this does depend on the chemistry and comfortablity y'all are showing beforehand."
Does anybody else feel like they don't find anyone attractive on dating sites/apps?,"I've spent the last few hours swiping on people on an online dating app & I feel like the pictures just don't do people justice. I either come across people I don't find physically attractive or those model types where I'm not even going to try to get a match with them. Does anybody else feel that way? Idk if I'm just too picky, too raw from an ex, or what..."
Online Dating - Tips from an Average Joe (with examples)!,"First of all, hey. How are you doing? This will be the first and last time I open like this.

I’m a 24 year old male student, average plus looking, I’d give me a 6 or 7, but beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I don’t have a fancy job or even a car, I’m a pretty average man who has had a great amount of success on dating apps. After lurking around and trying to improve my game and myself, I’d like to share what personally helped me improve my chances to translate a match into a date.

**Opener**

Openers are important. They are. You should always think of a good one, with the balance of being witty, funny and charming, while not sounding too “try-hardy”. Sounds tricky, and at first it is, but a good opener improves your chance significantly to get a date with the girl you’re talking to. Still don’t think openers are important? I’ll share a story.

I live with two female roommates. We’re pretty open with each other and share stories about our dating lives quite often. One night we’re hanging out and we talk about dating apps, one thing led to another and they ended up both creating accounts that same night. They both got over 100 likes. In less than an hour. Woke up in the morning and one had 300 and the other 400. After 24 hours they both got over 999+ likes. 

Point of the story is, if it wasn’t obvious already, women tend to have a lot more option than men on dating apps. For every girl you’re talking to, there’s 19 other guys texting her and sending her messages. 50% of those men will probably open with “Hey”, or “How are you doing?” or some variation of that. Men who want to improve their chances need to stand out of the crowd. If our appearance isn’t going to help us stand out, our opener will. So how do we do that? 

Think to yourself “What do you like about this girl?” “Why did I swipe on her in the first place?” “What’s attractive to me about her?” Thought of something? Good. Take that idea/compliment/statement and add a little twist to it. Complimenting is always better than “hey”, but something even better is to take that statement and be playful or tease a little bit. I read a tip on the ""dating advice"" sub by [LeatherDaddyLongLegs](https://www.reddit.com/user/LeatherDaddyLonglegs) which I agree with- If you're going to compliment someone, compliment them on something they have control over. I’ll give a few IRL examples of openers that got me numbers. Bear with me since I’m translating from my native tongue to English:

Girl with a bio stating she’s studying engineering, has a dog in one of her pictures:

    Me: “I’ll be honest with you, I just want to meet your puppy, but I haven’t found her on the app yet.”
    Her: “Haha it’s a he. Are you still sure that you want to meet him?”
    Me: “Sure, but make sure he doesn’t have any expectations. Maybe I’ll meet a cute engineer along the way.”

Girl with a bio stating her hobbies include singing in the shower, generic pictures:

    Me: “I hope you like singing outside the shower as well, you can complete my duet while we cook dinner”
    Her: “Hahaha, I’m not sure that you want to hear me sing. But I am pretty good in the kitchen.”
    Me: “Stir-fry is my specialty, but I’ve got some more recipes up my sleeve. When we grab a drink, you can hint what you prefer”

And my favorite: Girl with generic picture, no bio or bio consisting of a random emoji (Like what the hell is that supposed to mean)

These ones are tricky and are pretty common. Go back to what I wrote before. Why did you swipe on this girl? Is it because she’s cute? Is it because she’s throwing off good vibes? Does she seem like a genuinely good person? Take that thought and add a twist. It’s like a cold open, but for dating apps. If you meet someone IRL, you can ask them a question about something fun, or you can make an assumption about her. This works in dating apps as well, do that and let the conversation flow from there.

Examples:

“You seem like a fun person to be around, I’ll see if I’m right when we grab a drink”

“You seem like the athletic type, or did you just snap a cute picture to show off?”

Experiment with your openers, and don't be afraid to be daring. Don't play it safe, tease and have fun all while being respectable of the person you're talking to. By the end of the day, we're all here to enjoy ourselves.

**Getting her off the app**

You thought of a witty opener, and she responded. Great! Now what? 

Every person is different, some will give you a dry answer to your opener, some a “hahaha (add emoji here)”, some will give you some material to work with and some won’t answer (you can’t win them all). Your job is to get her off the app and into your phone/Snapchat/Instagram as smoothly as possible. Use texting as a means to an end, you’re not trying to build a connection via texting. You guys both swiped on each other. Take that as a hint that she’s attracted to you. My general rules of thumb to do this as effectively as possible are:

1.)	No interview questions- You’re not trying to get to know her. You’re trying to get her on a date, so you can meet up face to face and get to know her then. NOT VIA TEXTING. Imagine this scenario:

You’re a girl with 20 messages in your inbox. 10 of them say “hey” (or some variation of that). She answers 3 of those messages because the guys follow rule 1 to an insane degree. She looks at the other 10. One asks her “What do you do for work?” She answers a dry answer. Another, “What do you do for fun?” She answers another short response. “How do you enjoy spending your spare time?” She doesn’t answer and gets off the app. 

Texting shouldn’t be a chore and getting bombarded with questions isn’t fun. Interviews are dreadful enough, imagine if you got 10 interview questions every day. You probably wouldn’t answer them all, and eventually you wouldn’t bother with them all together. I'm guilty of texting the girl a lot before the date to get to know her. I learned that the effect is more negative than positive. If you don't have anything interesting to share or say, you're better off not texting at all.

2.)	Text with a purpose- What’s your goal? Why are you texting her? Imagine texting like a path from point A to point B. Your job is to get from Point A (matching) to Point B (a date) as smoothly as possible. Don't make the mistake and mindlessly text her like I used to, navigate the conversation towards that. One way I like to do it is:

    Me: “(Some statement on something we talked about), I’ll see if I’m right when we meet up for a beer. Or are you more into wine?”
    Her: “I like both to be honest”
    Me: “And when we grab a drink next week, what would you prefer?”
    Her: “Hahaha, well it would honestly depend on my mood.”
    Me: “Give me your number and we’ll see when we can make that happen.”
    Her: “Haha #####”

Always think a step ahead on how to navigate your opener into fun banter, from fun banter to hinting that you should go out, and if you get a good response from her, get her number. 

3.)	Banter > Questions – Asking questions is good for one thing- to get the banter rolling. If you don’t have information to work with, asking a good question can get the ball rolling and can get her to share more, which gives you more information to work with, which leads to better banter, which leads to a better chance of you getting a number. I’ll use an example where I ended up double-texting after she didn’t respond and got a number (and eventually a date):

    Me: “Good thing my A/C is working so I can chill after being let out to dry”(Bad translation)
    Her: “Sorry, I didn’t see your message”
    Me: “Happens to the best of us. So how does your athletic side come into play?” (I assumed before that she had an athletic side to her)
    Her: “I was on the national gymnastics team.”
    Me: “Do you also do cartwheels and handstands on random objects in your apartment?”
    Her: “Hahahaha not really, I’ve gotten lazy”
    Me: “Too bad, that could’ve been a sight to behold. How about we get off this app and you give me your number?”
    Her: “Haha alright ######”

4.)	Close on a high note – Don’t ask for a number out of the blue, because if you do that, you’ll mostly be brushed off, or worse, get ghosted. Look at the examples above. If you get a good laugh from her or if she’s responsive towards going out with you, it’s a good sign to try and close her number/social media. She’s much more likely to give to you as well. Worst case scenario she says no, brush it off and change the subject.


**Setting up a Date**

Congrats! You’ve charmed her and you’ve got her phone number (I don’t do Snapchat or IG personally). Send her a text with a GIF (bitches love GIFs) or something witty and try setting up logistics. I’ll walk you through my thought process:

Ask her out to X activity on date Y, her response is...:

**Yes:** Great! You’re all set, send her a text back that you’ll see her on date Y, you’re excited to see her or something sweet of the sort and end the conversation. Check back on her at the date that you’re going to meet up to make sure you’re set to meet up on that day.

**No, but I’m free on Z:** Great! If you’re free aswell, set up on that date and follow the directions above.

**No:** Okay, why did she say no?

**“I’m busy, I won’t be able to”** – Alright, at this point I’d brush it off and ask her when she’s available. If she doesn’t give me a definitive answer, I’ll 
send her something like: “That’s fine, hit me up and take care”, and stop talking to her. The ball’s in her court now and you shouldn’t be hounding girls 
who won’t make a little bit of effort to meet up. Remember, dating is a two-way street. Don't waste your time on people who won't give you the time of day.

If she does give you an answer, she’s interested and try setting up the date.

**“I get off work really late”/”I have to study until late”’/”I’m too tired” etc.** – This isn’t a hard no. She’s making excuses on why she can’t come. This is 
where persuasion comes in, convince her that you’re worth it, just make sure you’re not too pushy. I follow a rule I learned while I was working in sales: 

If I get one ""no""- Why did she say no? Agree with the reason and try to persuade and charm her otherwise. If you get a second no, drop it and talk to her at a different opportunity. Nothing is a bigger turn off than neediness, and the last thing you want is to pressure someone into doing something they're not comfortable with.

People are willing to sacrifice sleep and time if they believe they’re going to have a good time. I’ll share an example of something that happened to me last week, with a girl that lives 40 minutes from me (sadly I don’t have a car ATM):

(Background: We decided we’ll be spontaneous, that we’ll meet up today and she’ll drive to me, but it will depend on how she is after work)

    Her: Hey, I think I won’t make the drive today :( (Not cancelling yet, just thinking about it)
    Me: It’s all good, we’ll find a different time.
    Her: Sorry, I know it’s not very spontaneous of me.
    Me: I expected more from you, maybe I’ll see your spontaneous side at a different opportunity.
    Her: Haha always have low expectations, I have to find the energy to make the drive (Warming up a little)
    Me: Grab a cup of coffee and drive. Worst case scenario that you’re exhausted and can’t drive home, you can sleep on my comfy couch. (Teasing a bit)
    Her: Hahaha what?? Instead of offering me to sleep in your room you’re offering me the couch?
    Me: You can order me a drink first before you jump into my bed
    Her: Haha
    Me: Anyways, if you’re feeling spontaneous hit me up. I’m going back to my books to study, they need some attention.
    Her: They deserve it haha! Alright, I have 11 minutes to decide.
    Me: (Insert happy GIF)
    Her: Alright I’ll come.

If you've come this far, thank you for reading and I hope you found this useful. Good luck and happy dating!




*Edit* 

**Thanks to everyone who upvoted and commented! It's always good to see other people's opinions and get another perspective. I'm considering writing up another one of these, but more along the lines of how I like to date-prep after the date is set up.**"
"How do you not take being ""ghosted"" personally?","Something as wonderful as dating, unfortunately, comes with the dreadful prospect of being ""ghosted"". How does someone go from ""talking to you makes me feel like I've known you for years"" to radio silence? And to add insult to injury, how do you not take that personally? 

The horrible thing about being ""ghosted"" is not the fact that a romance didnt spark, it's the ripping of the hope that we held out for your decency. And worst off, we make excuses for your newfound muteness. Then, we check our phones more than usual, hoping to hear from you or even see if you're online so we know that you're actually still alive. Only then, it hits us - you've decided to vanish. 

I wasted days thinking about someone who didnt value them. I think that's what it boils down to - the realisation that the high regard you held them to was not reciprocated. The late-night calls, the inside jokes, the secrets - they were personal. I take it personal because we made it personal."
Here is what I learned in my 112 active days of online dating...and Ive stopped bc ironically I found someone in-person,"What I learned or had reaffirmed from my dating blitz**^1** (31 different girls, 78 dates,!nearly 10 new “bed post notches,” over $2,500 spent on dates, app subscriptions, clothes, etc)

* whether you believe you’re out of their league or you’re not (overall, not just in the looks department), ***you are right***. 

Confidence really is everything. And insecurity really kills boners and lady boners. 

* It’s a lot more feasible to follow Rules 1 and 2 than you believe — but it takes work

Sure, genetics rule all. 

But if you work out, get a fitting haircut, take care of yourself overall (nice skin, healthy skin color, healthy looking eyes, not-yellow teeth) and you show some sort of effort in fashion, you’ll be ahead of the curve so much that you’ll be considered physically attractive. 

I am not conventionally good-looking. But I workout, take care of myself, dress well when needed, and I’m an awesome person. 

I’ve gotten feedback such as “you’re fucking addicting” and “you’re extremely attractive...official 12/10 rating” and “no, you’re cute” (after I passively texted “oh that’s cute” to a dog pic) etc. 

But fret not...

* It’s like the worst-kept secret that guys typically take terrible pics 

...and the ones that take great ones usually disappoint and/or are narcissist (just from the many anecdotes I heard). 

I got so many “wow you look so much better than your pics” and “why do guys always take such bad pics?”

Because we are guys. 

Of course, that brings up the quandary of whether you should knowingly put up a bad pic or try too hard by putting up a try-hard pic. Obviously, the answer is neither — though even our best pics still don’t do us justice. 

But isn’t that better than being photogenic? Even for a dating app? Better that than disappointing someone IRL. 

* your first online messaging convo should be 10 minutes MAX

Just some flirting, some clear signals of attraction and suggestive comments for activities, then mention that you’re jumping off the app to do something else and — this is up to you — either give them your number or ask for theirs.

I’ve had great success just saying “k gotta go but we should totally [get pancakes for dinner] so text me at 9118675309” and like 80% of the time I get a text within 3 minutes, 95% of the time I get a text. 

* girls are way too good at taking pics. Beware. 

No body pics nearly always means they’re hiding it. You may be into it. You may not be. I’m just pointing it out. 

Even the hot girls don’t look as hot in person. 

Why?

Girls have literally 1000s of pictures of themselves, on average. Imagine their top 0.5%. They are not going to look their 99.5% best the first time nor every time. 

But that’s obviously ok. 

* There is such a thing as having too many dates and it’s a shitty thing to do

It just is. It’s narcissism. I had that streak. And I got my penance for it. I did shit like slept over at a tinder girl’s date then showed up at an 11am brunch date with a girl I actually liked 20 min late because the previous girl’s shower felt like Chinese water torture, and I showed up in the only clean shirt I had — that girl’s souvenir Toronto tourism T-shirt that smelled like a girl. 

But the worst was having to try to be mature and break it off with girls I had been on 3-4+ dates with.  

It broke me. It humbled me. I don’t ever want to feel that way again. No it’s not a good problem to have. What the fuck will you do with all the dates? Naturally you’ll be seeing like 4-5 people for the 3rd or 4th time — it just doesn’t work. 

* Do not talk dating with dates

Obvious. But not so much. I did this early and got punished and stopped. 

Many others still did this. 

* Hope for guys: the quality of the dating pool for girls may be deep in numbers but shallow in quality

So don’t worry about how there are so many guys. You cannot control that anyway.

Change what you have control over — yourself. 

* Personality goes a long fucking way

We all know this. Imagine being with a hot girl or guy who is vapid and stupid. Now imagine being with a moderately cute girl or guy who makes you laugh and makes your heart sink when her name pops up in your phone. 

* Improve yourself for you. Sincerely. Then, dating benefits will come 

I’m done convincing people of this. Either you get it or you don’t. But I’m comfortable calling this a truth. It works. Trust the process. But you should be doing it for yourself — you owe it to yourself. 

Here’s what scared me straight: imagining meeting a multiverse version of me who was the best version of me and picturing what he’d be like and how terrible he’d make me feel. I tried to become that guy. 

* Asian guys: stop making excuses

It’s not because you’re Asian. It’s because you’re letting it get to your head. 

I dated like 50/25/25 white/asian/other. All the girls were attractive physically. I even had a pseudo relationship with a hot black girl (until she tried to propose to me, yikes). 

Rid your insecurity and do away with excuses. And hitting the gym may help. 

But yeah, there are girls not into asian guys. But then again, this summer I heard at least from a dozen different girls “I never thought I’d _____ with an Asian guy.” 

Oh also, asian guys who are violently and/or emotionally abusive, go fuck yourselves. The stereotype is strong according to too many anecdotes. 

* Tinder has gotten worse very quickly, but Tinder Vegas is awesome

If you’re looking to just hook up in Vegas, fire up that Tinder and spring for Gold. 

I feel like Tinder in Vegas brings the app back to its roots: a user base comprising mostly young and hot people looking for no strings hooking up. 

Just put in your bio you’re in Vegas for XYZ period. It will work. And like 9/10 profiles are HOT. 

As mentioned I was 35 now 36, and hooked up with two smoking hot girls (age 26 was fine but age 23 made me feel a bit creepy...until we were hooking up...what?) back to back nights and we haven’t talked since.

* If you’re looking for relationships, CMB and Hinge worked well for me

Bumble must run on college interns because Bumble was fine early May then just got worse and worse over the summer. 

I get high quality matches and likes on Hinge for free. 

I get high volume and occasional high quality matches on CMB. 

Tinder is hit or miss. 

* Value NOT “shared interests” but ***shared principles***

No one gives a shit if you guys both like At The Drive-In or Godspeed You Black Emperor.  Congrats, you both listen to the ultimate hipster music before hipsters were a thing. Who cares?

I already have people in my life who share interests with me, people with whom I get along well — they’re called friends. 

You want to share relationship and life-outlook principles with your significant other. Quoting your favorite GB Shaw quote during a fight won’t do shit. 

If anything, having different interests makes it more fun. Lots of new things to try. And you know it’s real when you find yourself staring at her as she discusses her hobby passionately and you just keep thinking of how to participate with her or get her something thoughtfully related as a gift. 

* actions speak louder than words

What they say matters little. What they do matters a lot. 

We should know this by now. 

This is how I knew the one I’m with now is the one I want to be with for the long haul: she was the 31st different girl I had met, and I had a second date after a great first one — and for the first and only time, I showed up to a date 15 minutes early instead of 1-2 min early or late. I did it because I really liked her. She noticed (since I was picking her up) and she later told me she saw it as a good sign from me. 

* it’s not them it’s you

More times than not, this is the answer to “why can’t I find anyone?”

* it’s much better to show physical affection early than to play it safe

This is how you get ghosted even by people who liked you. 

No surprise, many girls (and everyone else) like to feel wanted. 

Don’t play games, don’t play it safe, don’t be gross. You’re on a date. You already find each other attractive. 

**SHE COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE THAT MOMENT WITH SOMEONE ELSE OR NOTHING AT ALL...BUT SHE IS THERE WITH YOU ON PURPOSE**

Yes it’s from Hitch. Doesn’t mean he’s not right. 

The date is yours to fuck up. Everything is in place. 

Little things like putting your hand on her back or shoulder blade for two seconds, or grabbing her hand to help her out of the car, or a playful slap of her arm. They work. 

Also, pick up on cues. If she’s on your left and totally moving her hair to the other side while talking to you, she is giving you signs. Too many signs to list. Research them. Act on them. 

You may get rejected, sure. 

Better than being ghosted and “not knowing” where it went wrong. 

* Don’t lie 

Duh. It’s a lose lose. If you get serious with her, she will find out. It’s also social and sexual fraud. 

* The One doesn’t exist. But Your One does. And that person may be online, or you might meet that person in real life. 

I didn’t learn this so much as it just reaffirmed something that didn’t need reaffirming. 

Stop looking for him or her. Fate nor destiny doesn’t exist. There is no grand plan. There is no cupid. Etc. 

This is all comforting. It means that it’s in our own hands. (Sure, “luck” is involved, but not so much luck as it is just fortuitous timing and placement in a completely chaotic world where we have virtually no control over what happens, and even then, we have no knowledge of what could have been or what could be). 

But the bottom line is that you don’t have to worry about there being only one or “the only one” out there — the only thing you should and can worry about is what you can control: yourself (your self-identity, your appearance and grooming and hygiene and style and look, your fitness shape, parts of your personality that are more pliable and definitely the negative traits, etc). 

For me to have met my current (and likely last) SO, sooooo many things outside of my control had to have happened. Even if, for example, I happened to show up to my yoga class 5 minutes later that day then she and I 100% wouldn’t have ever met since she went to my class for the first and only time, and I met her ***in real life*** (poetic how I spend all this time and effort and money on online dating only to find My One**^2** through in-person interaction).  

What I could control was my fitness, appearance, my sense of humor, and the ability to muster up enough “courage” to ask her out after a yoga class (probably what some/many girls would just hate happening in their yoga classes, especially if more men came just to make it “a place for guys to meet and ask out girls” but I legitimately do yoga twice a week to balance out my exercises). 

**And she said yes**. (And I don’t think that’ll be the last time I’ll say those 4 words about her and me asking her an important yes/no question; though technically she “rejected me” when I asked if she wanted to grab some coffee afterwards only to find me on FB that night — we had talked a little bit outside before class began — and apologize and explain that she was a bit taken aback and flattered and blushing when I asked her out, and that she mainly said “no” because she “felt gross and sweaty” after hot yoga, but that she wanted to grab dinner instead...and the rest is hopefully history forever in the making)

As I said, SO many things had to happen for us to even date. None of that I could control. But I could’ve been a disheveled slob and likely not gotten a date with her even if the stars aligned...but I can control whether or not I look presentable. 

* Bottom line: it’s chaotic out there, online and in the real world. Take solace in the fact that you can only worry about what you can control, and relative to the chaos, there’s very little to control 

Again, just physically, you can turn yourself from a 5/10 or 6/10 — depending on just how “off” you are with grooming yourself or how bad your haircut is etc — into even an 8.5/10 or something. 

**Step 1**: get a proper and possibly new hair style/cut. GO TO AN EXPENSIVE STYLIST JUST ONCE TO GET A RECOMMENDATION. Even a place that costs $35 for a haircut. They’ll tell you what best fits you. 

A haircut can make you look like a bum while another can make you look handsome AF. Compare World War Z Brad Pitt to Oceans 13 Brad Pitt, Limitless Bradley Cooper to Limitless Bradley Cooper after he has “cleaned up,” or *NSYNC Justin Timberlake to Justin Timberlake, or John Krasinski in the early seasons of The Office to his final season...and he keeps getting better looking now that he’s RIPPED....

**Step 2^^: hit the gym and watch what you eat. You don’t have to go full John Krasinski but there’s like a 95% chance that you can improve your physical health/looks, whether it’s trimming some fat, gaining some muscle, ridding yourself of the cancer patient look, dripping down from obesity, etc. 

Biologically, women are *generally* attracted to “healthy looks,” like good skin color, healthy shape, healthy hair/skin, ample muscle tone, etc. Many of these things help with producing better offspring and protecting the offspring. 

**Step 3**: Overhaul your wardrobe if it “sucks.” Hell, you can spend a few hundred dollars at H&M and have enough “stylish” clothes for years as a guy. 

There’s no single style. Pick one that suits both your personality and body type. Maybe you like skinny jeans but you’re overweight — don’t do it. Maybe you like the grunge look but weigh 130lbs at 5’8”. Well you can’t even wear loose flannel without looking like a girl who slept over at a guy’s house. 

Pick out stylish clothes that accentuate your best features. I have a strong jaw line and high cheek bones, so I keep my hair rather short and choose shirts and jackets that have collars that accentuate my jawline. I have nice arms and shoulders apparently (I had better have them, I worked out for them), and I often get complimented about them because I wear NOT *tight* shirts but shirts just loosely above “fitted” where it’s almost like I’m hiding them. 

**Step 4**: General grooming 

Accentuate your features, but also choose a style that matches your personality and life stage. Don’t be wearing lettermen jackets if you’re 38, unless you look young or are black (in which case they look young too). 

Grow a beard if your jawline is “missing.” Shave if you have a jawline and/or can’t grow a glorious beard. 

Cut your hair short or shave it if you’re balding. Grow it long if you have a small head and round face. Cut your hair if you have a square face and/or jawline, as long hair looks AWFUL on square jaws. 

Have the right facial hair. If you can’t grow it fully just go clean. 

Shower shower shower. Not just on date nights. Bacteria accumulate. You don’t want to have trouble getting rid of BO because you haven’t showered in 4 days. 

Wear clean clothes. 

Footwear is important. Don’t wear the same 2-3 pairs of shoes unless all 3 are very different, fashionable, clean, and they can match your clothes. And this applies only to first and second dates. Don’t wear your Jordan’s for a second time on your 4th date...at a steakhouse. That shit may have flown on your second date playing mini-golf and going casual because it’s summer and outdoors but good god man have some shoes that you can wear at a place that has cloth that doesn’t have unlimited breadsticks. And no, work shoes don’t count. 

FIND YOUR *OWN* SCENT. Believe it or not, that Light Blue cologne from Dolce & Gabana that you believe smells great? Yeah, only like 10,000 other guys in your area think so, too....and thus, it’s popular. You don’t want to end up smelling like everyone else. 

You can still wear popular colognes but I suggest ***trying Axe body spray*** to BLEND, not MIX or COMBINE, the scents. 

Yes.  Body spray. For 2 reasons (if you need another, I’ve had at least 5 girls tell me I smell great unprompted on dates, and another 4-5 friends say the same)

1) Reddit will tell you that Axe is for 13-year olds. Largely, they’re correct. But you’re not using it as your catch-all tool to smell like you’ve showered. You’re using it as a non-cologne fragrance undertone to blend with your cologne and make something totally ***unique as a fragrance that girls can only associate with you***. Of course, this matters more with girls you go on 3rd+ dates with or are in a relationship with. The body spray goes UNDER your outfit while the cologne outside if, with some cologne underneath. Small dabs though. 

2) you want to smell good naked, not just like deodorant but body spray and a hint of cologne, whereas with clothes on you want to smell like cologne with hints of body spray. 

Just do NOT smell like the last guy she just had dinner with. You WILL encounter that if you just wear cologne from Macy’s (nothing at all against Macy’s; they have all colognes that even the stores themselves don’t carry in stock, but it also means many men go there and buy the same ones you’re wearing). 

* **FINALLY: yes, self-improvement is the key. But do not do it for anyone but yourself. Do it for dating and you will never attain the level of improvement you need. It’s a catch 22. Thankfully.**

**TLDR: either you read it or didn’t. It’s your dating life. These are words from someone who dated nearly 3 dozen girls in a short time and learned a great deal.**


———————————————————–

**^1**

I’m fortunate to have been able to date at all. Yes I was the best version of myself. But...

First off, I’m an Asian guy — strike 1 for online dating, I’m 36 — strike 2, and my pictures are all years old because I don’t take selfies and I’ve had to I untagged myself from many Facebook pics during a job search a half decade ago — strike 3. Many will tell you that being an Asian guy alone = zero dates, and many will tell you being over 30 and especially 35 will hinder you, nope...still got dates. Oh, and I used pics from like 2011...which many girls called misleading because....well, I’ve gotten countless comments on me being “far more attractive” in person (someone even rated me as a 12/10). 

**^2**

Yeah it’s early but while age is just a number, it can also be an indicator of dating and relationship experience. We are both around our mid-30s, but no kids or divorces....just bad “luck,” and we both have and had zero desperation in finding a partner because we were both on the verge of taking a break from dating...

...but we managed to bump into each other and we are already in ***marriage***-talk mode, which, if we weren’t in our 30s with extensive dating and LTR experience each and we were 24 instead, we’d probably be focused more on ***wedding***-talk, as the former focuses more on how we’d operate as partners and things we notice that makes us great partners and the latter focuses on just being swept up in love — or infatuation — and *getting married* instead of *staying married*....it’s just two young kids not wanting a good thing to stop, without thinking about how the good thing can last and how much work it takes. My Also, since my SO and I have had many LTRs, this is one of the cases where we have bot the “just know” feeling but we’ve also logically thought it out)"
"improved my life, now dating sucks","In the past few years I have improved my life so much. Doubled my salary, have my own side business, work out all the time, have my own place etc. Generally happy, feeling good, like life is going somewhere. I have the money to go out and buy nice clothes and shit, etc. 

But my dating life has gone to shit. I haven't met anyone in the past two years that all this has been going on. When I ask people in IRL, they seem to cringe at me. I go on dates, but it's like, nobody is interested in a person who has their life on track? All I get is ghosted or rejected. 

3-4 years ago I was broke, depressed, never took care of myself, etc. and I had women throwing themselves at me, like would sleep with several a year, etc. I dressed like a bum, dirty sneakers, oversized clothing, did nothing but play video games, etc. Despite being a 'loser' through all my 20s, I always had girlfriends. 

What the fuck is up with this world? all you ever here is 'improve yourself if you want to date', except, I did, and now it sucks. It doesn't matter that objectively I'm way more attractive and feel more confident... if nobody will actually date me? I don't understand how my happiness is such a rabid turn off to people. 

Even my friends have commented about how much better I seem to be doing and they are really happy for me... and they say 'yeah man makes no sense to me either, i don't get why anyone dated you back then, but now you seem like a real catch'.

My experience is so backwards compared to common sense/general advice. I am really getting frustrated and depressed about it."
Learning the difference between a situation that needs communication and a situation that's a sign things just won't work out saves everyone a lot of time!,"I think the first thing you should do when you're dating or in a relationship with someone and something is bothering you you should communicate and find a way to fix the problem. This should be the first step because realistically a lot of dating problems can be fixed with more mindfulness and intentionality by all parties involved.

BUT **there is a difference between an issue that just requires some communication and effort from both parties and an issue that is just a testament to how much two people should not be together.** Sometimes they are just not into you and/or vice versa and no amount of communication will fix that fact.

Someone that is into you will listen, speak on their side of the issues, and encourage you to work with them to find a middle ground, compromise or solution because to them, being with you is something they value and enjoy and see most problems trying to impede that as worth fixing. You will both make attempts to meet each other's needs.

With someone who is not into you, you will feel the need to communicate the same exact issue again and again and you'll be met with either verbal promises that never actually materialize, or they will react negatively to seemingly natural requests, e.g lashing out and making you feel bad for bringing a reasonable request up, or they'll just ignore it.

I'm sharing this as someone who learned it the hard way.

TL/DR: Pay attention to how people respond to your needs and how you respond to theirs. Sometimes ""They're just not that into you"" and it will not work out is the only conclusion."
Anyone else feel horrible for not being successful in dating? (24 M),"I’m so sick of it. I hear so many comments about not having a girlfriend from my family and coworkers. Either they’ll ask why I’m not getting dates despite explaining myself so many times, or they find ways to make comments about it in conversation. They act like it’s the easiest thing in the world, they’ll say “just go on tinder” even though I’ve made it clear that I’m not comfortable with the idea of hookups, not that I would even be able to get them. 

The worst part is that everyone is absolutely enthralled by my younger brother, he’s the little darling of our family even though all he does is constantly pump and dump chicks like some kind of pickup artist. He’s a beefy jock type so it makes sense that he’d have more success. But I just feel like they’re always trying to compare me to him because the rest of the family (especially the men) are a lot more like him than me. It’s always been that way. I’m usually the lightning rod everyone gangs up on. 

Here’s the thing. I’m smaller, I’m nerdy, I’m less outgoing. I like to stay inside and read books or discuss various topics. I like myself though. I don’t want to change. I’m sick of feeling like everyone wants me to though and that to be a valid man I have to attract women and to attract women I have to be a certain way. 

You know, I’ve tried. I’ve approached so many women. I believe I have a lot to offer and that I’m not a loser, so I don’t have confidence problem. Whats bothering me is the endless rejections I have come to expect. I’ve kind of given up at this point because I always just know I’ll get rejected. It really hurts constantly feeling worthless and lonely, after a while you begin to think there must be something mentally wrong with you. But you can’t find the reason and that drives you crazy so you try on all these different philosophies about dating but none of them really ever fit.

Now I just want to be left alone to not date and tell people I’m just not really interested. But maybe I’m the biggest hypocrite of all because that’s a greasy lie. The truth is, late at night all I can think about is how nice it would be just to know that somebody I like actually likes me back. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
Modern Dating is a Really Shitty Game,"A game where everyone is highly disposable despite each player having non disposable feelings. A game where selfishness and lies are rewarded with convenience and bliss. A game where stronger players and even spectators can prey on weaker players because everyone is highly disposable and nobody really cares about your feelings unless you're helping them win.

It may not seem like such a big deal if you're the type of person who constantly has new options to milk and attempt to win with, but it's actually really rough for those of us who have to wait months between decent chances of getting anywhere near a win. It's especially rough when one of these chances just turns out to be someone wasting our time or simply using us for whatever secondary objective they're really after.

What's sad is that if we could all grow a spine, communicate with one another like grown, responsible adults, and treat each other's feelings like we'd like our own to be treated this game wouldn't be so nasty and difficult.

But oh well. All a boy can do is try his best and set the example for what he'd like to see in the world."
"Did anyone try the ""ignore women, live your life and women will enter your life"" approach? It didn't work for me","I see this dating advice given out a lot of times. They say to ignore women, live your life and you will find that women enter your life and become attracted to you. I've also seen many times guys saying that once they start ignoring women, women became more attracted to them.

Did it work for you? I tried this approach for about 3 years and nothing happened. I wasn't any closer to getting a girlfriend, a date or sex than I was before. I lived my life and achieved things but nothing happened with regards to women."
Dating = Darksouls,"Dating is like playing Darksouls with no autosave.

You try. You die. You go back to the start. 
You try again. You die. You go back to the start. 
You try. You die. You go back to the start. 

You try. You get past the first boss! Then the second! You're on a roll now. You push that part of you aside that's telling you ""Don't let your hopes up. You're going to die again just like all the other times"". You get to the final boss. You make one mistake. 
You die.......  You go back to the start.

You're shattered. You're exhausted. You HATE this game and you want to stop playing it... 
... But you REALLY want to beat that final boss! You WANT it. You NEED it. You DESERVE it! 

So you try again. You die. You go back to the start. 
You try. You die. You go back to the start."
"Is anybody else not worried about the first date anymore, because you'll know you'll be ghosted right after?","I've been on a few dates and all of them end the same. They never talk to me again. I was going to have a date today, going out for breakfast, and I was thinking about why I wasn't nervous or anything. And then came to the realization, I probably won't to talk to her ever again. But who knows, there could be hope, considering she cancelled our date because she doesn't feel good... unfortunately like a dingus, I didn't check my phone and showed up to the place and waited for 5 minutes until I turn on my phone to tell her I was there.... Then I got the cancellation message.... 😑"
Online dating is dehumanizing,"I hate that you can virtually bond with someone over the couple of a few texts and before you even get the chance to ask them out, they’ll ghost you into oblivion and stop responding completely.
I get that everyone is free to do as they please but I’ve been rejected at least three times this past week just by girls who stopped replying and let the conversation die, even if it was well.
Im a girl by the way. It just sucks. I’m hopeless and I feel like I’ll never be able to meet anyone for real. 
Im gay so it makes it twice as hard for me to find someone to date and online dating is a good way to meet women but if they didn’t ghost after three messages that would be better"
I’ve “settled” before; here’s what happened. (Female Perspective),"I’m a 28 yo female. Currently single and I’m just here to give a little story about a long-term relationship where I felt I was “settling” and describe how it went. 

I don’t really like using the term settle when describing this relationship or just any relationship for that matter because it has a negative connotation making it sound like ‘ohh I gave in and said yes to the ugly but nice guy’ - that’s not what happened in the story I’m about to tell and I find that in most cases where women and even men feel as though they are settling, it’s not a matter of he/she isn’t good enough, it’s that he/she isn’t the right person. 

I was 23 when I met him (were going to call him Ryan). It was a tinder date. I had pretty good luck on tinder. I met zero creeps, I met very decent professional guys, I matched with most of the guys I had swiped right on (of course not all wanted a relationship and I was respectful of that, I wasn’t offended, I understand what these dating apps are for - just politely told them that’s not what I was looking for or just didn’t pursue anything).

Online dating can be fun and very useful, especially for someone like me who’s pretty shy and introverted (but opinionated and definitely not submissive). Obviously physical appearance is the first thing anyone notices but then comes all the other important attributes (interests, lifestyle, goals/ambitions, etc.) and I do my ‘swiping’ based on the criteria I see/like in that order, especially because I’m doing this for serious dating (side note: tinder was not as saturated in 2015 as it is now. And I no longer use it for dating, due to the many fake/spam profiles). 

So here’s how I’d separate the guys I’m “swiping right on” - there are guys: 

- I really really REALLY like 

- I definitely do like

- I kind of like 

Ryan was a guy I kind of liked. He was a good looking guy (but not my type - dont scrutinize me, I’m allowed to have a type). He was smart with multiple degrees, and I could tell from the look in his eyes/face that he was a genuinely good guy (I ended up being right). We matched. He was easy to talk to/text. He was very quick in asking me out and since I was very eager to get into dating and hopefully meeting someone and getting serious with them, I said yes. Even though I wasn’t really that into him, I thought it wouldn’t hurt. 
Our date went good. He was very very easy to talk, I felt comfortable around him. I had fun. He was really good at ‘courting me’ (hate that word lol but ya). He was a gentleman. I learned that he had a really good job, he was financially stable at age 25! And he wasn’t bad looking. 6 ft, physically in shape, dressed well, well-spoken, great guy! I went home that night not really thinking or feeling anything. I just fell asleep like it was any other night. This story is getting too long.... so we eventually started dating. About a month in I broke up with him because it just didn’t feel right. But then two weeks later, I started to feel alone and I called him and said we’re not getting back together but let’s just go on a date and see what happens. We eventually continued dating..... It was very on and off because I struggled a lot with our intimate life, I had a really really hard time getting into it with him and we really tried everything.... even therapy....

Now I know everyone’s going to wonder why we didn’t just break up for good? Well on my end, it was hard because I had found such a great guy, who understood me, loved me, cared for me, was ALWAYS there for me, he was such an amazing friend to me and that was the problem, he was more like my bestest closest friend that I didn’t want to kiss and have sex with but I did it anyways because he desired me in that way and I felt that I should be doing this because he’s my boyfriend and this is what people do in romantic relationships. I was very open with him about my feelings and had expressed my struggles very clearly from the beginning and he would react by going from being frustrated and resenting me to completely ignoring what I was saying and being in denial about it because he had a bit of a superiority complex (it wasn’t that intolerable, I teased him about it quite often actually) so because of that, he had a hard time even comprehending that someone wouldn’t be “into him” but I’m sure part of him also felt hurt because his feelings/desires were not being reciprocated (at least not genuinely).
The craziest thing was, he was willing to stay with me, he never even considered breaking up as an option, he wanted to make it work and I just went along with it until I couldn’t. 

Our relationship lasted 1.5 years in total with many many breaks in between. We did a lot together. We traveled, stayed in and drank wine, cooked together, ate out at fancy restaurants, he gifted me many many beautiful things. But we also had our ugly moments too. Arguments about my feelings (or lack there of), our awkward sex life (sorry for tmi but I would mainly stay dry to the point where it actually hurt - I never had this issue with anyone else). Toward the end, he loved me but hated me at the same time. We ended on bad terms and don’t speak. I never regret our breakup. I felt suffocated and confused. I had met a decent guy who treated me well and loved me and wanted to give me the world but I just couldn’t bring myself to be into him. I found myself fantasizing about random men all the time while I was with him. He took me “ring browsing” at Tiffany’s once and as excited as I was I kept thinking “why am I here with him? I want this but not with him”, it was awful. I always felt this void. 

So here’s why I wasn’t attracted to him even though he wasn’t considered an unattractive guy. It’s because I have my preferences just like anyone else and sometimes (like in my situation) it’s NOT OKAY to ignore these “preferences”. It’s what we desire. I’m not saying it’s the only thing that matters, but it does matter and shouldn’t be ignored. I learned my lesson. I gave a guy that I wasn’t attracted to a chance and it didn’t work for me. 

So what I took away from that experience was not to swipe right on someone I kind of like. What I do now when I meet a potential someone in person or come across a potential profile on a dating site, I immediately picture myself having really hot passionate sex with them and if I like it and it excites me then I continue with reading their profile and deciding whether or not there’s potential. I know it sounds crazy but it’s helped me avoid situations like the one I described above. 

Now I feel like I’m going to get backlash for the passionate sex thing. People will say things like... oh well... women are only going to feel that with the “top 20% of hot men”. NO. That’s not true. Men on here really don’t give themselves any credit. They bag on themselves more than us women do. Maybe the guy I get excited for when picturing myself having really hot sex with doesn’t look like a Calvin Klein model with a perfect hairline and abs (I actually prefer an average body-type honestly) so don’t say things like that. That guy Ryan I dated, he used to get checked out by girls allll the time when we were out and I always felt confused honestly, I didn’t understand why I couldn’t see what they saw. 

Anyways, to end my story. Don’t ignore the signs of attraction (or lack there of). Don’t listen to people who talk about “leagues” and are telling you to lower your standards and “settle”. Don’t ignore your instincts."
Not sure why people always put a group picture as their main dating app picture.,This happens so often. They would have a picture of them next to their friend. I always hate it when I see one where I’m like “oh that person is cute! I hope it’s that person” and then it turns out to be the least attractive person in the picture in my opinion.
I was dating an Instagram normie,"Things seemed fine at first, but I did notice she seemed to use an awful lot of emojis in our txt conversations.. but I was smitten and refused to see the signs.

Then one night I caught her taking selfies in bed.. and it all became clear. I checked online and sure enough, Instagram account with 2k followers. There was my bae with dog ears. I felt so played. 

It's over with her, but at least now I know the signs.

So confused...are people still visiting their date’s place during this quarantine? What’s the general advice?,"I’ve been holding off on visiting someone I started dating right before the quarantine, as I’m trying to be extra cautious right now. However, my roommate has still been bringing over her SO to our place every now and then throughout all of this. I think her SO lives with roommates too, so this has all been making me a bit uneasy. Am I right to ask that he not come over for a while, or are many people still doing this? I’m trying to keep my distance either way. I’m in the U.S., west coast."

"Hey you single, beautiful, soul!","Valentines Day is around the corner and I know it can feel shitty, but just remember that romantic love isn't the only type of love there is.

Love comes in many forms, so who cares if you aren't in a relationship? Love for friends, family, chosen family, pets, SELF-LOVE. All equally important (sometimes even more important), and all equally valid.

So go on, celebrate love on Valentines Day, in whatever form you have it in. Spend time with loved ones or just treat yourself. You deserve it."

While the media is bringing only negative, toxic news to your mindset, I will tell you how you can come out of this crisis more sociable and with more confidence than before.

When was the last time you were forced to sit at home with plenty of time, no restaurant to go to, no activity to do outside and no distractions?

Right now is the perfect time to look at your life and ask yourself:

Am I happy with my life?

Do I feel fulfilment in my relationships?

Do I feel lonely?

How would this crisis be different if I had a person by my side whom I care about?

Sometimes life gives you a chance to review the way you are living. Don't take it as a thing that is ''bad''. You have the opportunity to self-reflect and set some goals - Don't waste it with binge-watching Netflix. 

The choice is yours. 

Do you want to come out of this crisis the same as before? Nothing will have changed. Except that you will have watched every series on Netflix.

Or do you want to come out of this lockdown smarter and more confident because you finally set plans and asked yourself what exactly is bothering you about yourself and your life?"
Deleted dating apps — and I’m single.,"I’ve been using dating apps since 2010, and I’ve had a handful of relationships but nothing that was ever too meaningful.  They’re not for everyone, and I realized that a littler later than I should have.

A piece of advice for anyone who cares to listen: don’t use apps if they aren’t working for you. Plain and simple.  Live your life and do things that make you happy."

"I [21 M] have absolutely no idea how to meet new women without potentially creeping them out, how do you meet strangers these days?","So I really struggle with dating. I’m 21, a little socially awkward, not entirely ugly but I’m a short ass, which doesn’t help me with tinder or other online dating apps. I don’t really like them anyway, I do get some matches, but they never go anywhere at all. It feels so hard to get to know someone that way. I’ve come to realise the big issue for me is that I see hundreds of women who catch my eye, but approaching them in a way that is sensitive to the fact that they deal with creepy, shitty guys day in day out, and managing to break past that barrier and get to know them is basically impossible. Because of this, I just never try get to know girls I think are attractive. It just seems like a crazy idea to me at this point. I should probably mention to begin with that I completely understand that women tend to have their guard up around guys they don’t know for a very sensible and understandable reason. It’s the creepy pieces of shit who go out their way to terrorise women that are the root cause of all this. it’s completely normal to feel like this. I feel however that this is a problem not just for me, but probably hundreds of normal, everyday guys out there, who mean well but just have no idea how to approach women while being respectful of how weird it is to be approached by a stranger.

Like, how the fuck do people meet each other these days man? It’s a mystery to me. After school finishes it just becomes seemingly impossible to meet anyone to date. In class at college I try keep to myself, and try not to sit next to any girls I find interesting cause I don’t want to be that creep that sits trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get a degree. I wouldn’t want to date a co-worker, for obvious reasons. Online dating completely sucks as a way to meet someone unless you’re intrinsically good looking, especially for guys. Average looking guys just dont get that many matches, and women get too much to the point that they have to be pretty picky about who they want to match with. It’s kind of a broken system. I’ve never been the type to try have a drunken hookup with some girl I meet in a club, again people just aren’t that attracted to me until they see a glimpse of my personality, and that can take time, and it’s hard to get that across shouting over the music at some stranger you don’t know. That leaves the same group of girls I’ve been friends with for years, who I see most weekends and have had some flirtations with over the years, but I know that none of them really see me as dating material. I’m at a point in my life where I need to meet some new girls and start dating, but I’m completely stumped as to how to even go about it.

It basically leaves a few options that all just seem crazy. Basically, just approaching any girl you find interesting or ‘sliding into the dms’ of someone you kind of vaguely know, which just seem ridiculous to me. Like no girl wants to be approached by some random guy when they’re going about their business, and no girl wants some stupid reply guy filling their dm’s up with stupid hollow attempts to get to know them.

I really just don’t have a clue how to meet girls. I’m not a completely lost cause; I’m not some fedora wearing neckbeard. I’m a little socially awkward, and it can take time to get to know me, but aren’t we all like that? It’s just that the girls I know well have known me for so long they see me as just a friend, a drunken hookup at the very very best, and me being a little socially awkward means that meeting new people is something I overthink to hell. I see what girls put up with all the time, with random guys approaching them on nights out and hopelessly trying to flirt with them when they’re just trying to get on with their day, and I never want to do that. So, my question is: how the fuck do you meet people to date? It sounds simple, but it’s completely beyond me. I just wish it was as simple as seeing a girl you’re attracted to, saying hey, and getting to know them. I wish the world could be that friendly, but everyone has their guard up these days (for good reason) and it just doesn’t work that way man."
They’re not “that” busy.,"I had to remind myself tonight that no one is truly *so* busy that they cannot make time for you. No matter what. 

I’ve been pursuing a girl for some time now, but I’m calling it quits. We had good chemistry, but I haven’t seen her in months. She makes excuses on every chance to get a drink, coffee, go out, etc. However, she goes out every weekend. There is no excuse you can make to make it seem like you are *that* busy. 

Don’t let someone have your time of day when they won’t even give you theirs. It’s not worth it. Cheers to you beautiful ladies and gents of Reddit. On to the next one

"
Is it normal to feel a bit sad on Valentine's Day?,"I used to push my bitterness and sadness away for a long time by acting like tomorrow is just another day. Just another stupid holiday that people go crazy for. But recently I've been accepting my feelings and thankfully let go of my bitterness thanks to the therapy that I've been getting. 

But I do feel sad and lonely though. I walk around and see some people holding hands, kissing, and hugging each other, and it makes me feel isolated. I feel like I'm missing out, and it honestly kind of sucks. 

Is this normal?"
Is the bar really this low?,"I'm a 21M guy and I think I look alright but kinda besides the point.  I feel like every girl I go out with is so ecstatic to have a dude that isn't making lood comments right off the bat, or super awkward or just normal for the most part.  Like I don't think I'm a superhero by any means but dating has just seemed so easy lately.  Is it just my age range, is it being in a big city?  Has anyone else male or female noticed this?



Edit: I truly did not know this would be so divisive.  I also have never written out lewd before so pls forgive me."
Attachment Theory and why modern dating sucks,"So I love psychology and was recommended this book called ""attached. the new science of adult attachment and how it can help you find and keep love"". I read it all in 2 days and learned a lot about myself but also my previous partners. I will be putting some ideas from the book mixed with personal experience and what I've been seeing on this subreddit.

First there is a thing called attachment theory which is how we connect with others and how we interact in relationships. There are Four types of attachment styles: Secure, anxious, avoidant, and anxious-avoidant. I unknowingly fell in the anxious-avoidant and it has led me to not find a fulfilling relationship. 

A secure attachment person has healthy expectations for a relationship and can communicate their needs and desires. Note that having needs and expectations is a good thing and not something to be looked down for. A lot of advice I've seen on the page is about not having expectations. The people often asking for advice are asking how to bring up communications or desires which secure people already know how to. This makes up a pretty decent size of the population, i'd say about 50%. These are the people who easily find themselves in a healthy relationship. This doesn't mean they will always be in a healthy one and may end up staying in a unhealthy one because they can forgive their SO and don't keep count against them. They may also be able to communicate and their actions may lead to some changes in their SO but their SO (who is one of the other 3) may fix it temporarily and then fall victim to their attachment style. These are the types of people who are upfront about what they want or need in a relationship early on, have healthy boundaries, and will not deal with games early on.

An anxious attachment person will be constantly seeking attachment and commitment. They are very sensitive to negative signals. They can feel when someone is losing interest, any change will cause an alarm, and they may come off as ""clingy"". When their alarms go off that they may lose their partner or potential love interests they need to be calmed down and if they're not they may do things like over text, call, get mad, etc... They're fearful and may lash out. Some may try to punish their love interest to teach them to never do that again. They don't communicate their needs clearly out of fear of scaring their partner away from them. They make up about 25% of the population.

An avoidant attachment person is afraid of commitment. This person may do really well until they feel ""pressure"" or ""too close"". They may be proud of their independence and don't want to rely on anyone else. This can go to an extreme where they stop paying attention to their Love Interest out of belief that they should also be self-reliant. These people are the type to ghost after someone says they love them or they are showing large amounts of affection toward their  Love Interest. They don't communicate their need for space or for things to slow down. They rather do things to keep their Love Interest at arms length.

Anxious-Avoidant are a combination of anxious and avoidant. These are people who really want a relationship and they get anxious that their love isn't reciprocated so they push away and claim to be self-reliant. 

So what happens when each of these interact with each other?

Anxious vs avoidant tend to be a pull push cycle. Anxious person seeks closeness and tries to get closer while avoidant pushes the other away.

anxious vs anxious may end up in an extremely codependent relationship who are always walking on eggshells with each other.

Avoidant vs avoidant tend to fuck and leave. Never really committing and always looking for something better or just not communicating that they wish they could stay but are afraid.

Secure vs Avoidant are capable of lasting. Secure may not deal with someone wishy washy like an avoidant forcing the avoidant to either run away or deal with their shit. Secure may also give avoidant the space needed for a healthy relationship to be built. 

Secure vs Anxious are also capable of lasting. the secure can communicate to the anxious and ease their tension. The anxious may also push the secure to extremes or get bored of the secure because there is no emotional rollercoaster.

&#x200B;

So what does any of this have to do with online dating? Well the anxious and avoidant people are going to be recycled on these apps because their actions keep them on the dating market. Secure people are more picky and may commit once they find someone worth their time.

So how does one fix this issue? Simply communicate your needs and desires. If you're seeing someone and start freaking out, calmly say what's going on with you and what you need from them. Make sure you date secure people and people who are putting in the effort. It's already hard enough finding someone who like to spend time with but dealing with someone's attachment style is hard if you're not a good fit. Figure out which one you are and work on fixing it.

tldr online dating sucks because insecure people stay recycled on those apps. Figure out which one you are and learn to communicate. Having needs is not a bad thing and keep yourself in check."
The regret feeling for trying,"You ever have that feeling of seeing someone either in person or on your social media and wondering why you ever thought you had a chance? Even though you had people in your corner hyping you up and building your confidence because they want to see you happy. So they encourage you to talk to the person you find attractive and you're interested in, But you know that in your mind you don't have chance with them in hell with them. Then you do it and you end up getting rejected by them or they aren't into you like you are into them. Then a few days, week, months go by and you come across them in person or on social media and you sit and wonder why did I think I even had a chance in hell with them?"
What the fuck is wrong with people?,"I've posted about this guy I met last month a few times so I won't go into too much detail but I am passed the point of feeling sad and onto being pissed off and just disappointed. 

I met a guy in early September and we hit it off very well in messages. We hit it off even better in texts, he was so attentive and sweet, and this was before we even met. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is. We met and he could not have been more excited and expressive about how he felt. When we parted ways after our first date, he told me he already missed me. Yellow flag? Now, I believe it is.

So this kinda stuff continues. He tells me to leave a goddamn toothbrush at his house the first time I stayed over (and 2nd time we hung out) because he just *knew* we would be spending a lot of time together. He can't wait to introduce me to his friends, he wanted to wait to sleep together because he didn't want to rush and ruin things, etc. etc. Hindsight is 20/20, and maybe this all should have been a warning but I guess I thought it was genuine excitement. Even though I was a little like ""WHAT""...I felt very similar and I ate it up.

He got distant and cancelled plans that he set up. I try not to read into it and didn't mention any concerns until it was twice in a week. He assured me over the phone and in person when we saw each other again that he was still just as interested and he just got busy and stressed. I left it at that. He made another plan. Then cancelled that plan. He didn't talk much the week of that and went away for the weekend. Sent weird, confusing texts and at that point I was like, ok what the hell is going on??

I got no straight answers. I told him very clearly, if he isn't interested that he needs to be fair to me and just tell me so. I thought we both enjoyed hanging out and that we wanted to keep doing so and get to know each other. I got no response to that so I took that as my answer that he wasn't interested in dating me. I then later on was told that I was wrong in thinking that. 

I took a few days to not give any energy to the situation and came back to see what the fuck was happening. Why he can't just say what's on his fucking mind like an adult. If you act weird and someone questions it, just say what is going on. He tells me that we should meet up and talk and get on the same page. I let him know if it's something he can say over the phone, there is no need for a meet up. Because the whole ""we need to talk"" thing is making me think it's because he doesn't feel the same way that I do. Once again, I am told that I am wrong and he wants to explain things. 

The day comes to meet up. I am anxious as fuck and wondering if this is all even worth it. But I'm very curious as to what he has to say. An hour before he texts me that he is not coming. That he doesn't feel comfortable. That I was being too serious before. That he scares easily. 

WHAT. THE. FUCK is wrong with people. So you come on strong, get distant and weird and I question it and that's me being too serious about things? A big part of why we clicked is because I thought we were on the same page about dating. How the fuck am I going to get to know someone if I don't spend any time with them. Okay, cancel on me once or twice, things come up and life gets hectic. I get that. But again and again, yes I am going to question if this is something you want to pursue. I gave him multiple chances to say he was too busy at the moment to date. Or he lost interest. Or he met someone else. Be a fucking adult and tell someone that. Playing games and sending cryptic messages for weeks is not the way to act. ESPECIALLY when the weeks before that was nothing but great conversations and great dates and future fucking planning. 

What is wrong with someone like him? What the fuck could not be said. What is so fucking scary? How do you tell someone you think you need to talk, then tell them you need to talk BEFORE YOU TALK? What a colossal waste of my time, my energy, my feelings. 

I did like him, too. Through most of that shit I still liked him. And I'm not going to say I acted cool and collected the whole time. I eventually lost my cool and send some long winded texts. But nothing crazier than all the shit he said to me when we met. Yet, it comes back on me. And then I start to wonder if I did something wrong along the way, that scared him off. But fuck that thinking, I liked someone and I wanted to spend time with them. I thought that is how you date. 

I told him that there was nothing to talk about and I didn't want to speak to him again. I can never bring myself to send the classic ""you're an asshole. You wasted my time. You lead me on,"" etc etc texts because it's not my style and it's not like it will resonate. The crazy part is that I have been out with other guys since I met him. I ended up not connecting with anyone like I did with him, but I still put myself out there because it's too early to know for sure about anyone in 1 month. That's why I said I wanted to get to know each other to figure out if it could be something. 

What the fuck. 

Well, I have a date tonight so, we'll see. At least I try."
"Why don't more ppl apply ""he/she is not that into you"" when it comes to the dating game?","Seriously.  It's the most simple rule, and it answers 99% of questions you may have.  The vast majority of the time, this reality is the answer to anything you may be wondering about, and will save you some mental torture.  We try to make excuses for ppl, like ""maybe he/she is extremely busy"" ""maybe I said or did something wrong"".  No.  They just aren't that into you.  Pppl let a lot of things slide when they are into you.  Fact.  Also, the ""busy"" excuse.  No.  Anyone who is interested can and will make time for you, or at least go out of their way to let you know they aren't intentionally ignoring you.  Ppl who are interested DO NOT leave you hanging.  Why?  Because they don't want anyone else capturing your attention.

As someone who is guilty of all the ""wondering"" bullshit myself, I think we in the dating game would have a much easier time if we just look at reality.  The vast majority of the time, if you find yourself questioning their interest level, it's simple - THEY'RE JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU.  Move on."
Is dating sex?,"Throughout my entire life looked for something special in a relationship. The romantic film kind of relationship. But the more I got older the more I realized that most people don't care about trying to find someone special. Most people care about trying to satisfy them for awhile. And to some people, they may even call that dating. Which doesn't make since to me because dating to me is making a choice to be with someone you value in your life but in my dating experience and seeing the some of my exes evolved over time. It seems like people just see dating as sex know. And I still can't comprehend how someone can see dating as just sex..."
Did I do the right thing?,"I was on a second date with a girl, and she said ""I'm a fundamental feminist, I demand the same from my partner, I don't just expect it, I demand it""

I don't know why, but I danced away from the table (we were in a bar)

I did the move in which you bend at the knees at fist bump your chest, then I did an Irish jig to the door. Once outside I just thought ""ohhh dear"" and went home

I work with the girl's friend, so it was pretty awkward for a few days

EDIT. Thanks for replies/opinions everyone. Nothing really happened after that, other than having to work with her friend that I mentioned, but she was more passive aggressive than anything else

The girl I dated sent a few angry texts, but didn't show up at my work to cause a scene or anything like that

I don't even know why I danced away, I never dance, and I wasn't trying to be funny, or show off"
"remember kings, sometimes he/she just isn’t worth it and I know it hurts","I know it hurts sometimes but you’ll get over it. 

If she doesn’t show interest after a while or anything suspicious, just drop it. Wait for a real one to come. It’ll hurt but you’ll be much happier in the long end"
"1,5 years ago I posted here about an amazing date. Now, I am completely (heart)broken from the break-up with the same girl... I am lost and don't know what to do.","Since this is a subreddit for dating and my issue is about a break-up, I am not sure if this post is allowed here... However, I think I really need some advice on how to deal with things, since I am completely lost right now. Sorry if it is a bit of a story, but I really feel the need to write this off me.

Around 1,5 years ago, I created post here about how I've met this girl during my roadtrip through the US, after the roadtrip she came over to visit me once again (she lives in another country), and I really started to like her. After this post, we visited each other multiple times, both fell in love and ended up in a relationship. It was great. While it wasn't my first relationship, it surely was different then the ones I've had before: everything felt much more intense: my feelings for her, my happiness every time I saw her, texted her or called her, everything. While normally I wouldn't think a long-distance relationship would be something I'd be interested in (my last relationship before that ended because of the distance), this time it wasn't a problem at all. Everything felt great and for me, it felt like we belonged together.

But ofcourse, no relationship is perfect. Sometimes our personalities collided: while I often say/do things out of emotion, she often did/say things from a more rational point of view and had a hard time showing her emotions to anyone. This resulted in us sometimes not understand each other why the other one did/say something and could cause a discussion. But despite all of this, I was still happy to be with her in the long run. We both worked hard for this relationship.

Last January, the first big issue came. I was at her place and we had a pretty big fight in the morning, which resulted in a break-up. However, I stayed there the rest of the day because I didn't want to leave yet and she didn't want me to leave yet... The evening came and I had to head home (had to drive for 6 hours to get home). Saying goodbye at that moment was horrible. We spend around 30 minutes sitting in my car crying in each others arms, before I eventually drove of. The drive was horrible. I was constantly in tears, couldn't focus on the road so had to stop every time, and even had to vomit a few times. So I texted her how I felt and the situation I was in... and she called me. She was in tears as well, saying we might have made a big mistake. Now, many people are not a big fan of restarting a relationship after a break-up for multiple reasons, but it was obvious here that we both still loved each other and couldn't let each other go yet... We didn't want to pretend nothing happened, so we decided instead of heading fully into a relationship again, we would 'lable' ourselves as 'back to dating' to take some of the pressure off. A week ago I flew to her place once again, and we had an amazing time! No discussions, no fights, everything seemed great.

But then, one week later, she called me. She said she has thought about us and everything a lot, and she said her feelings concerning 'being in love with me' have faded away and she sees me more as a friend. That call broke me. Personally I thought we were heading in the right direction again, but I guess I was wrong. I can't help but blame myself.

Due to the distance, she has send me a letter explaining her feelings. When this letter arrives (it hasn't yet), we will make one final phone call, to give both of us the opportunity to ask questions and make sure no things are being left open. Then, we will break contact for a while. We both don't want to lose each other out of our lives, because we still care too much about each other. We want to continue as friends, but both know that is only possible when I am completely over her and have learned to love her as a friend instead... But thinking about not having contact with her after that call is hard. These last few days were horrible. I can't focus on my work or study (I am a student pilot, so I had to cancel all my flights for this week due to a lack of focus), I start crying in the most random moments... I am a mess. I don't want to sound pathatic, but my heart is broken and I don't know how to get over this... I have the feeling I have lost my soulmate and love of my life, and I can't stop blaming myself that it now is over...

EDIT: Thank you all so so much for all your kind, incredible supportive messages full of tips and tricks! While I am on Reddit for a while now, I had no idea the Reddit community could be so supportive! I will try to react on every single message I get, because since all of you invested some time in trying to give me some (really great and usefull) advice, the least I can do is react to it! I'm currently a bit overwhelmed, but I will get back to you if your message hasn't been answered yet! Again, thank you Reddit!!"
I held hands with someone for the first time in my life today!,"I know this isn’t a big deal to most people, but at age 18 it felt like it was a long time coming. I feel like most people my age that I know held hands with someone back in middle school or early on in high school, so I definitely feel like a major late bloomer. 100% worth the wait; it just has a special feeling that a lot of the things considered more “romantic” don’t have. 

Didn’t have anyone to tell without sounding like a hormone-filled 13 year old so I’m here now :)"
So my attempt at getting back into the dating world just ended in the most spectacular way.,"It's our third date, she offered to make me dinner at her place.  After dinner we were talking and cuddling on the couch.  We disagreed over something somewhat political, then she started insulting and berating me.  I eventually had enough and said ""I am nowhere near emotionally invested enough in this relationship to fight this hard to make it work.  And honestly, I don't have to take this from anyone. "" So I grabbed my coat and then when I went to open her front door she straight up punched me in the face.

So yea I think that's enough dating for me for the year.

**Edit**:  Had a few people ask what the argument was, so I've copied my other comment.

I had mentioned how a few people have told me I kinda looked like Obama. She got unreasonably angry and said how much she hated him. Her reaction threw me off so I decided to steer the conversation away from politics. She was too riled up by that point and said I ""have a lot to learn"" and ""don't know anything about life"". 

She's a bit older than me and this was the third time she had said something like that to me. I had already told her once already that it's extraordinarily rude to say shit like that to someone. So I said it again, only this time I added ""I don't have to take this from you, or anyone for that matter"". 

Then I put my jacket on and was halfway out the door and WHAM. 

I'm not a doctor or anything but I don't see how anything I said warrants that kind of behavior.

I think her anger might not have been so much about politics, she might just hate Obama because her ex husband also kinda looks like him too.

"She asked for a second date, then the day of told me she's not interested","I met my crush at a bar after DMing her on instagram following the fact that we matched on Tinder. The date went as well as I could've hoped and we ended up at my place. She was excited to escalate things sexually but I  told her that I like to get to know her first. It was clear her intentions were to hook up, but I thought it would be better to cut it at kissing. We continued to dance and hangout, and it was obvious we were both attracted to each other. On top of that, **at the end of the night she even asked me out on a second date at a museum during the next week.**

A few days later, I reached out to her to confirm the time to meet at the museum. She replied the day of saying she was not interested in pursuing anything further, but thanked me for the invitation. I'm confused because she asked me out for the second date, *not the other way around*. Not sure what I did wrong. Saw her on the train home too that day lol. This one hurts

Update: Thanks for the silver, stranger! Appreciate everyones thoughts and feedback. If anything changes, I will let you guys know"
"Online Dating: Men, FFS put a bio and don’t take pictures with the camera pointing up your chin and nostrils or half naked on your couch. It makes you look like a creep.",I wish I could reach out to people and tell them why their pictures or profile might be hurting their chances.
Craving intimate sex,"I've been seeing a FWB for almost a year now and while I get along with her well and she is fun I have no real emotion towards her. I have explained this and she's fine with things being the way they are.

Every time we have sex it makes me feel that bit more lonely. I mean I do enjoy the sex and so does she but it really makes me miss that close intimate sex you can have with someone.

I do go on dates to meet other people but I've never found anyone I really like.

I'm 33 this year and sometimes you do wonder if this is going to be it. All my friends are in LTR, married and have kids. On the plus side it gives me a lot of time to focus on my goals and dreams but I really do wish I had someone to share my heart with"
I'm tired,"(24M) I'm tired of people telling me that 'there's always someone out there for you""  or ""have patience and the right one will find you"", I'm tired of hearing lies all the time, like I rather have people tell me the truth and say ""hey your right, no one is going to date a guy like you "" I literally rather hear that than getting my hopes up for nothing, I don't want to wait around for something that'll never happen..."
A classic: Unrequited Love,"Dating is an adventure into the unknown with some of the highest hopes we humans are capable of.

You start off completely neutral, ready for anything, mentally prepping yourself for all possible outcomes.

But sometimes, the moment you meet someone new, it's instantly and unequivocally clear: you are in love.

This person takes over your thoughts. You seem to have lost control and desire one thing only: to love them unconditionally.

You know it's unhealthy, and yet you can't help yourself. It transcends everything you do, blinding you to the likely and painful truth: it's not mutual.

Unrequited love is one of the most painful outcomes in dating, and it's all too real. 

To all my unrequited lovers out there, you may feel alone, but you are not, I guarantee it. Find solace in this, and never lose hope ♥"
Online Dating would be better if..,"You read their profile and then if you like their answers their pictures are then shown. Instead of the typical picture first then profile feature.

If you don't like the photos you can still swipe left. This isn't meant to discard looks.  It just focuses more on compatibility initially. 

Then if you see potential you see the photos. Then you can swipe right if you like the photos after the personality. Or swipe left you don't."
I feel like I’m actually doing this right for once,"I’m (20m) having my third date with this lovely gal(21F) on Friday. We’re going bowling! We’ve been going at this slow pace that I’ve never gone before, and I haven’t had anything like it. My last actual girlfriend was unable to go on dates because her family was controlling and didn’t know about me. Her mom tracked her phone, watched her like a hawk. So we only saw each other at school. Her mom questioned her when she saw me at my McDonald’s job for 5 minutes. Another girlfriend I had after her only lasted 3 weeks and we only had one date and then saw each other and fucked 2-3 or more times a day. That was nice, besides her emotional instability. That was when I was living in Orange County. Here, in my small hometown, I figured I wouldn’t meet anyone because there was no one to meet. I was wrong.

I met her when I saw her in the building I’m always in at the college, which is the theater building (I’m a music major). She was panicking looking for her wallet and I helped her look. I did some circuits around the inside of the building and she went to the student center to the lost and found. I kept looking and I made a circle around the building. She came back a while later and I was still looking. I stopped for a minute to practice piano but something just pulled me into looking. I couldn’t just stop. No way. So I saw her in the theater again and she was kind of amazed that I was still looking. We exchanged names and went on our way. Next time I saw her she was working at the local grocery store and she shook my hand, said she actually found her wallet. I told her she could find me at the theater building Mondays and Wednesday’s. We saw each other again soon after that and basically said we should hang out but we didn’t exchange contact info. Next time we saw each other was the 50th anniversary concert at the college and I performed with the vocal jazz group and she sung with the chamber choir. She gave me her number but I think it was a texting app. She never responded. I don’t think I saw her for another 3 weeks and I almost completely forgot about her. I was going to sleep on one of the couches in the theater building  and she got my attention and we added each other on Facebook and that’s when I asked her on a date.

This slow pace that we’re going feels like it’s going lightning speed. That’s because it feels natural, and she’s actually interested in me as a person. For the first date we got coffee. That was really nice but super nerve wracking. I ordered a mint tea with honey and lemon because my voice was shot and I had a performance that night (I was supposed to be on vocal rest but I made an exception). When we first sat down I froze up. I kept opening my mouth but no words came out. I visibly expressed some level of frustration and then I excused myself to the bathroom, splashed some cold water on my face and came back. It was all good after that, but I think my nervousness made her nervous too. We ended up talking for 2 hours and played chess (we didn’t finish though). And I think the staff was lowkey stalking us because they thought the date was cute. When we parted I thought about kissing her, but I didn’t and we only hugged. Overall it went well. Her eyes were quite dilated I noticed and I’m sure mine were too.

Next date we went to a nice restaurant and saw Tom Hanks A Beautiful Day in the neighborhood (I HIGHLY recommend the movie, especially on a date!). When we were at the restaurant I sort of confessed my crush on her by casually slipping in “the crush is real” in another context but implying the double meaning. She did tell me that this was the nicest date she’s ever been on. We were planning on seeing frozen 2 but it was showing too late. When we saw the movie it was top 10 one of the most emotional movies I ever saw. I cried and she definitely noticed. But I had my arm around her the entire time, and when it got to the part in the movie where the journalist was asking Mr Roger’s wife what it was like to be married to a living saint, and her response being that she doesn’t like that word because it implies that that way of being is unattainable. I said “what a beautiful way to be” I looked at her and we kissed. A lot. I put my other arm around her and she held my hand. When it was over I told her about an emotional self growth/self love moment I had. I drove her home and she made me absolutely melt because I walked her to her door and we kissed, talked some, I looked to my left and she moved forward to kiss me on the cheek. Something about that made my knees weak. Before she went in, she came back out and said “one more” and kissed me again.

Melted.

What a beautiful experience. It was genuine, it was a lovely connection, and I could argue that it was a spiritual experience. I felt 100% myself the entire date. I have Asperger’s syndrome and I told her that the first date. She said her brother has it too. That’s an important detail because I spent until I was 16 or 17 with a forever alone mentality, until I had my first real girlfriend that was a toxic relationship, and kinda grew as a person and my self concept changed so radically that I feel like a completely different person. Only recently have I actually considered myself to not be severely socially inhibited.

We’re having our third at the bowling alley and I might take her to a thrift store nearby and the ice cream parlor at the merc if it’s still open. Super excited about that, and she’s looking forward to it too. She’s lovely guys. I’ve got a good one potentially.

Tl;dr I don’t even know how to summarize this. Just read it it’s fucking beautiful and I’m really thankful for everything that’s happening in my life."
9 SImple Datings Tips for Introverts,"First dates are stressful enough; but when you are an introvert, they can be panic-inducing. You already don’t do well with meeting new people, but meeting someone you know will be “sizing you up” is definitely shallow breathing time. So, as you think about the upcoming event, you start re-living all of the past disastrous first dates you have had—your short, curt responses to questions asked, your inability to keep a flow of conversation going, those awkward “good nights.” And the shallow breaths are now accompanied by that grinding in the pit of your stomach.

While no magic wand can take your introversion away, there are some things you can do to master the art of the first date.

The Preparation  
1. No Drastic Changes  
Should you decide that you want some new shoes or even a new outfit for your date, go for it. But don’t make big changes. Don’t buy a pair of shoes or an outfit that isn’t “you.” And don’t get a brand new haircut.

Here’s the thing about such changes: You will spend the date being very self-conscious because you are not comfortable with such a change. You haven’t had your own time to get used to it, and now here you are on a date. Yikes. The goal is to increase your comfort level, and dressing as you always do will help that.

2. Pick a Dating Event That’s Short  
Meeting for a drink or coffee or attending some short event is usually the best for an introvert. There is comfort in knowing that it will be short up front, and you will have far less dread or stress. And, if thing goes well, that short chunk of time can always be extended into dinner or something else.

It’s much easier to approach the date this way than to plan a long evening, then try to cut it short. Actually, this is good advice for all first dates with strangers, so don’t feel that you are somehow different.

3. Choose a Place or Event You Know  
Going someplace new can add to your discomfort—you won’t know your way around and you’ll be distracted trying to familiarize yourself with the place. If this is the short first date, choose a coffee shop, simple restaurant, or a small bar you already know. You will be familiar with the table arrangements, the location and parking, the menu, and the people who will be waiting on you. All of these things will let you focus on the person you are with.

4. Pick an Activity You Enjoy  
If sitting across from a stranger and making conversation is awkward for you, why not choose a date in which you will be actively doing something? Weather permitting, you could go to the zoo or botanical garden; you could go to a wine or food tasting event or a street fest; how about a bar that has air hockey if you’re good at it? Being involved in an activity gives you more to talk about, and it allows you to “be you.”

5. Practice a Bit  
When job candidates go for interviews, they often practice answering the likely questions with a friend. A first date is a bit like an interview, let’s face it. Get a friend to sit down with you and ask you some likely questions. Practice both your verbal and non-verbal responses, including facial expressions and other gestures until they seem natural. Then, turn the tables. You come up with questions to ask your date, then practice being an active good listener as well.

The Date  
6. Ask Open-Ended Questions  
If you have practiced with that friend, you have questions to which there are longer answers than just “yes” or “no.” Ask them, and practice those listening skills with eye contact, head nods, and small smiles (and laughs if they are genuinely funny). You want that individual to know you have a genuine interest in others and in him/her specifically. Plus, how else do you get to know someone if you don’t ask questions that allow them to open up and show you who they are?

Instead of asking them what they do for a living, ask them what they like best and least about their job. Just don’t keep firing those questions out of nervousness. You won’t your date to feel like it is an interrogation. And if you have practiced the likely questions you will be asked, you will know what to share or not. Oversharing on a first date can be a bit awkward for the other person. Giving all of the details of your last breakup is oversharing—save it.

7. You Don’t Need to Hide Your Introversion  
You may be able to “fake” an outgoingness for a short period of time—especially if you have practiced this before—but you are really only doing that to make what you think will be a good first impression. If this first date turns into a second one, however, and s/he wants to take you to a large social event, your secret will be out. You don’t have to blurt out that you are an introvert, but as you talk about your interests and hobbies, it is likely that that aspect of your personality will come out.

8. Plan Your “Escape” in Advance  
If you’re seeing all sort of red flags, take note. Here are just a couple:

Your date’s talk is all negative about other people—last relationship, boss, co-workers, etc. This is not a good sign.  
Your date treats a waiter or waitress badly and/or loses his/her temper when something isn’t cooked just right—this isn’t a kind person.  
Your date is a narcissist and can only talk about him/herself, never asking you a question.  
An extrovert in this situation might very well be a bit confrontational and announce that the date is over. Introverts tend to bite their tongues and endure the pain for the duration. You don’t have to do this. Set up your excuses ahead of time. Have a friend text you about an hour in and have a signal to text back. Then the phone call can come that presents a situation that requires your immediate attention. Or start feeling poorly and go to the restroom. When you return, explain that you are ill and really need to go.

A fake excuse, mind you, should be used as a last resort; if and whenever possible, it’s best to be honest about things. You can bow out of the date with a simple “I’m sorry to do this, I’m just feeling a little overwhelmed with things and would prefer to go home.” In preparation for this moment, it’s a good idea to drive separately to your date, as well. No need for an awkward car ride home.

And Afterward  
9. Don’t Ruminate  
Introverts have amazing memories—detailed memories—because they take everything in. This is both a blessing and a curse. At work, it is often a blessing because introverts observe and listen before drawing conclusions and often come up with good creative solutions.

After a date, it can be a curse. Introverts tend to re-live every single moment, kicking themselves because they said something stupid or because their awkwardness/anxiety was showing. Give yourself a break. You are exaggerating and focusing on your perceived “bad” rather than on the many good things that probably happened. Focus on the positives of the date and what went well instead. This gives you confidence for a second date or to move onto someone else."
Honestly being cheated on stings,"I’ve been married and divorced and am not a saint or anything but I am proud I never cheated. Every time I’ve felt things are not working out and I might end up looking for sex/attention elsewhere I break things up before I even meet someone. Maybe that’s why I am single at 35  but it’s better than cheating.

Just found out yesterday the woman I’ve been seeing “exclusive” for six months and whom I’ve been to trips and already had a lot of memories has always been with someone else all this time.

You never get too old to feel disheartened and disappointed and it is really hard to not blame yourself and get a hit on your self esteem.

I wonder why it is so hard just to say they want sex with someone else or just accept we are just a hook up. Self centrism and selfishness that’s what it is. 

I am hopeful I’ll find someone. It’s never too late.

> Edit: The kicker is that the other guy also thinks they are exclusive...

>Edit2: Catching up on Netflix Sex Education and realizing now I need to be checked also sucks..."
My parents never taught me anything about dating. The Internet helped me learn in two months what they could have in years.,"Coming from a conservative Christian family, my parents never taught me about dating. They just told me stuff like :

""Boys are of the devil."" (So stupid because I have a little brother)

""Go to school, graduate, find a job, get married."" (Like it's that easy?!)

I really love my parents, I do, but I hated it that they didn't teach me ACTUAL and PRACTICAL skills on how this is done and I kind of blame them for my failures.

That's why I'm so thankful I found Reddit. Two months ago I was this naive, vulnerable immature woman when it comes to dating.

But after learning after several dates and a break up, I learned a lot.

I also learned soooo much about dating from YouTube and from Reddit and I'm soooo grateful for it.

Truly, this is a learned and applied skill and whatever success we accomplish is the result of hard work."
Is it weird for a guy to sleep with stuffed animals and love them as if they were his own children?,"I’m a 24 y/o working professional. I’m short but pretty muscular and have never dated before. What do girls think of guys with stuffed animals? I currently have a stuffed pig, two teddy bears, a moose, a rhinocerous, a penguin, and an elephant. They take up half my bed and I treat them like my own children. I have names for each of them, and pretend to be their father and cuddle them before bed each night. I also have a pillow that I humanize. The pillow is a picture of Ralph Wiggum (an animated little boy from the Simpsons who I think is adorable) and I pretend he is my own child and cuddle/kiss my pillow. Will women find this weird, and can I still maintain this habit? I’ve had these animals for as long as 20 years and don’t want to get rid of them, but I won’t mind storing them somewhere if my girlfriend or wife doesn’t want to share a bed with them"
"I'm absolutely gutted, from 100 to 0 in a instant.","So, I really haven't been that interested in dating anyone for a very long time, for at least 5 years. Sure I've met people that I liked but never really clicked, or they have other issues which stop me from wanting to be with them. I haven't really been looking... But I haven't been turning people away either.

4 months ago, I met someone who I thought was freaking amazing.  Very pretty, smart, funny, similar personalities, similar interests. She was absolutely stunning. She wasn't perfect, but initially we got on like a house on fire. Honestly It's been so long since I've felt a genuine connection with a female. I'm typically pretty awkward, but things just seemed really natural and easy going between us. We seemed extremely well matched.Issue was, that this was a camping trip and she had come from another part of the country. So we only saw each other for a few days before separating. For the last four months, we have been talking every day, and calling weekly. Things seemed really healthy, and I was becoming optimistic that I had finally found someone.

But things between us slowed down in the last few weeks. Largely because of me having a rough time with life in general.

* My sister tried to commit suicide, I saved her life after she overdosed.
* My dad has been extremely low with depression.
* My friendships have been suffering, due to me finding out about one of my good mates cheating in his relationship.
* My granddad is very ill, and likely wont leave hospital again.
* One of my mates died in a car crash.
* I lost my job (redundancy). And have been struggling financially.
* I failed study because of the above.
* I have felt really low, and depressed. Feeling like I don't have much support.

I let her know what was happening, and she didn't seem that worried at all. Although I wasn't reaching out to her as much as normal during this time, she would always respond straight away. She said she understood, and was really caring and supporting of the situation. So I planned a trip to go visit her and my brother, after things settled down. At this point we were not in a relationship, but were still really close. My plan was to see how things went, and perhaps consider asking her out if things went well (I knew for sure she liked me).Keeping in mind, I have family where she lives, and was graduating soon. The job market in her part of the country is ideal for what I'm studying... So moving to be closer to her and my family was defiantly an option. Any relationship with her wont have been long distance for long at all.

I booked flights, and she was really excited. All systems were go.... Until today. She messaged me, saying that she probably couldn't make it to our date, since she had to work instead.... I was really confused, since we had been talking about this for awhile, and she had told me she had taken the time off work.I then saw something on one of her mates snap chat, which to me looked like she was with someone else at a party.So I asked her whether she was seeing someone else. Her response, ""Yea, sort of... We have been staying at each others house, and seeing a lot of each other. But we are not really dating"". She then goes on to say how he is her ex, and they were together for 3 years a couple of years ago, and how they have caught up, and things are starting to pick up again.

I then asked weather I could have done anything differently, and weather things would have worked out if we were in the same city. Her response was that yes, she probably would have dated me if we were in the same city, and that she did like me.

So well, fuck. There's my weekend plans ruined. At least I have family up there, so my plans now are just to catch up with my brother, and help him work on his project car.Just feels like a really shitty ending, to a really shitty point in my life... So I've got a plane to catch in a couple of days, to go spend some time with my brother. Which is fine.... I was just really looking forward to seeing this girl. It's been so long since I've actually developed feelings for someone, and now I'm crushed.  


Edit: Grammar.   


Holy shit. Wasn't expecting such a large response everyone. Cheers for the support."
Ladies would you go on a first date in the morning eating breakfast?,"The idea came from a meme but could this be a good idea?
I look back on my previous dates and remember the anxiety of dressing to impress, I could imagine the pressure is worse on girls.
Going out for a movie, dinner or a coffee pretty much doing any of the usual dating things are so cliche especially in the evening.
But going for breakfast sounds more casual and more relaxed"
"Thanks to this sub, I finally learned to take the high road and be honest….","45/F here.  In the past year I haven’t had any action in the dating scene other than a couple bad & brief first dates.  Lately I’ve been feeling like it’s time to “scratch that itch,” as they say, so I turned to Tinder for help.  It’s not something I normally do, but what can I say; sometimes a girl has needs. And Tinder delivered!  Got matched with a very good-looking guy, my age, no red flags in his profile or our texts.  We decide pretty quickly to meet up soon, rather than text endlessly.  

&#x200B;

So we meet up tonight for a drink at a bar near my place.  He looks like his photos and is very sweet, there's instant chemistry, the conversation is flowing.  Before long we’re making out.  I bring him home to my place and things get hot and heavy. For a little while, I’m a happy girl.  But then…

&#x200B;

In the middle of us having sex, he says – and may I just stress here that this is our first date – “I love you so much.”  I don’t reply, and he says it again.  

&#x200B;

Me: “You do know this is our first date, right?”

Him: “I know, but come on, say it back.  It’s just words, it would be so hot to hear you say it back.”

Me:  “Nope.  Not saying it.”

Him:  “But it’s just words.”

Me, shaking my head vigorously as my desire begins evaporating: “NOPE.  I’m not saying that.”

&#x200B;

Suddenly things aren’t so fun anymore.  I’ve been with this type before – the love bomber, or whatever they’re called.  He’s also saying things like “You’re just what I was looking for,” and “I’m so glad we met, I really want a girlfriend again” etc. etc.  Alarms are going off in my head and I’m having instant PTSD from all the previous similar guys I’ve met.  They flood you with affection and say all the things they think you want to hear on the first date, and before you know it, you’re being stalked or emotionally abused or they want to move in together after two weeks.

&#x200B;

NOPE NOPE NOPE.  Bye bye desire.  But he’s still in my damn bed, saying he wants to ""do me all night.""  So I say I need to go to the bathroom, and I leave the room to go sit on my couch. 

&#x200B;

Even though I already know what I need to do, I log on to r/dating for a boost of confidence.  I read similar posts about all of your frustrations, and your awesome advice to each other.  I know I need to tell him this isn’t going to work. 

&#x200B;

After a while he comes into the living room, confused as to why I left the bed.  At first I say, “oh I’m just catching up on my work emails.”  He tries to kiss me and I resist.  He says, “So… do you want me to leave?”  

&#x200B;

I take a deep breath and explain that I think we’re looking for different things, I was only looking for a night of fun, but not anything more serious than that.  He takes it very well and says “oh okay that’s cool, I’ll get dressed and leave.”  And he does.  He says while walking out, “Hey let me know if you ever want more fun.”  I say I will, but I won’t.

&#x200B;

So I did it.  Instead of lying there all night, watching the clock, agonizing over what the morning will be like, what to do next, feeling bad about not liking him when he likes me (yep that was the old me) etc. etc... I just bit the bullet and was honest.  And it feels good.  

&#x200B;

So, thank you Reddit.  It took me a long time to gather up this kind of courage, but it sure feels good to be up front and express how I feel to a guy.  And to not lead them on, for fear of hurting them.  I know now that it’s ultimately more hurtful to disillusion them.  Or ghost them.  

&#x200B;

Sleep well, everyone!  I know I will.  

&#x200B;

TL/DR:  Met a guy online, he wanted something more serious than I did.  I got up the courage to be honest and tell him how I feel right away, rather than lead him on or ghost him.  He took it well and I feel so relieved."
I’m in my 30s. I’ve never had a gf. I’m about to be a physician. Getting in a relationship earlier would have only decreased the odds of me getting here. Worth it.,"I was a nontraditional student meaning I graduated with my bachelors degree, worked for a bank for a while, then went back to school to try to get into med school. I did and now I’m almost done with med school. Trying to get into med school was a weird idea for me before I got in. No one believed I could do it, not even me, but I worked my ass off for it anyway. I can only see a relationship holding me back from getting there in these circumstances. I think I would have been less of a risk taker and more realistic if I had been in a relationship. Which means no crazy med school dreams. So there’s really no reason to beat myself up about this. I should just move forward. I still honestly have all the time in the world."
Loyalty during the “talking” phase.,*mostly for men* If you are “talking” to someone  NEVER be afraid to talk to other people too. At least before you both have become exclusive. You can be loyal all you want but nothing is stopping them from not following the same rules. In the end you don’t know what they do out of your view.
Getting a Picture Together,"This is more to share my excitement at this milestone most people have in their teens. 

I’m 26F and I’ve dated plenty, have had boyfriends (none that lasted too long), but for the first time ever me and the guy I’m dating took a picture together. 

So yes, I’m super fucking giddy and happy and I’m looking at it all the time. (It’s also a live photo so I love it more that it captured us goofing off) 

It’s the small things like this that make me feel special and appreciated. It’s been 2 months with this guy and he’s just been a breath of fresh air of how easy it is to talk and be with him. 

So here’s to more positive stories in the future!"
How do I break it off with a girl who was bigger than her photos after a good date? Feeling terrible...,"So I was talking to a girl for a while now and we finally agreed to meet yesterday for drinks. As soon as I saw her I realised she used old photos and was clearly bigger than I was led to believe. We have a few drinks and after an awkward while it starts going ok, long story short we go back to hers but don't have sex. She was very quiet and is now talking about meeting her friends, which is too much for me, coupled with her bringing up her ex a lot.  I feel terrible though about it because we had a good time, but I didnt want to be an asshole on the date and not have a good time becaue of iy. Am I being unreasonable? I'm not free for a date this week so I have time to break it off ASAP. Any advice is appreciated. 

P.s. I feel like this should be an easy solve but its my first time doing this

Edit: thank you for all your help, I definitely went about the date wrong but it was an experience I can work on, you've really helped this overthinker!"
"Apology to the women I accused of ""having it easy""","Honestly? Yeah, as a single man I've let myself be swept into feelings of frustration and anger over women's ""impossibly high standards"" and the supposed disadvantage a male has in the dating world. I don't know why, but it's tempting to feel like a victim, like the world is unfair, to become angry and frustrated over it.

I gave it some genuine thought and came to these conclusions:

&#x200B;

***1***: I have some pretty high standards myself. Age (-7 or +5 compared to my own), location (at 40-50mi I'm starting to think ""that's way too far""), education (college-level+), job (must be able to contribute to a household and must be passionate about their job), looks (not expecting a supermodel, but must be reasonably fit, reasonably groomed & decent style, must speak to me on a sexual level,... luckily I don't have narrow tastes).

And that's just the basics, then there's common life goals and values, personalities that mesh well together, some similar interests + areas of being complementary,... Yikes, just typing it out I realize just how high my standards are... It's not just women, I suppose.

&#x200B;

***2***: I used to focus on the happy couples, the guys and gals who seemed to have no problem whatsoever getting dates, hookups and ltr's. But I realized that not everyone is constantly hookup up, or building a future with their high school sweetheart. I was blind to all the people I know – male and female – who have been single for a long time, never got into a relationship etc. And they're quite diverse... They're not all stereotypical ""weird uncles"".

Many were too busy with their careers or other interests, never thought that love and relationships were all they're cracked up to be. However, I do acknowledge that the population of 'forever alone' people has many people somewhat lacking in the looks and/or dating/social skills departments.

I was a late bloomer in many regards, but I've had several girlfriends and ltr's. Many of which started on the woman's initiative. I'm thankful for the experiences I've had in those relationships, and the lessons I've learned. Many of the eternal singles I know never had such opportunities – and I now humbly admit I could've been one of them, if it weren't for those opportunities.

&#x200B;

So in summary: to the ladies, my apologies for having been so quick to play the victim card – I don't have it as bad as I thought. And to myself: a regular dose of perspective can go a long way to prevent bitterness and cynicism.

I miss the feeling of being loved,"I feel like I haven’t felt it in so long... this is the longest I’ve been single in my entire life (2 years). I miss being kissed, cuddled, going out, having someone to always talk to.

"Why are men ""required"" to be the first ones to message , and ""must"" be original ?","Im all up for a cheesy but funny pickup line or the nice Icebreaker question but goddamn if all you have on your profile is your name and your photo , what am I supposed to say except the very simple and straightforward "" hey , how's your day been?"" 

Maybe Im just looking at this wrong , would like to know what you fellows think.

Edit : I'm looking at this from a long term relationship view , hookups and the such aren't my goal and so I usually try to avoid girls who are interested in just that ."
Try to enjoy being single and make the most out of it,"I had been single for a while, and I thought it was the worst thing ever. I was full of doubts about ever being able to find somebody, about my appearance, and even about my desirability to the opposite sex in general. I just wanted to have something going on with someone so badly that I feel like I missed out on the life that was going on around me. I hated the situation and myself for being in it so much that I didnt enjoy the quality time I was spending with friends and family. 

Well now I have something going on with someone, and while I really like this, I look back to the time I was single and realize it wasn't that bad. Clearly if someone likes me now, then all of those doubts I had were untrue, I just couldnt see it at the time.  It's not that I want to go back to being single, but I feel like I wasted a large chunk of my life just feeling sorry for myself, and well, life is finite and I wont get that time back. 

I know it gets frustrating and depressing at times, but understand that this is just as much a part of your life as are the times you're in a relationship.  You learn just as much from being single as you do when you're in a relationship. And above all, most importantly, if you can let go and make the most with what you've got, it will make you the type of person that's more attractive and will help you get into a relationship in the first place. 

Yeah, maybe this is survivorship bias. Maybe I wouldnt feel this this way if I never met anyone.  But its given me a lot of perspective, and I thought I'd share because I felt like it might be helpful to a lot of you."
How to ask a girl out,"I went out last night with friends and we talked to a few girls at the bar and before we left I said to the girl I was talking to “I like you can I take you on a date this week” and she said yes. 

So for all of you wondering how to get a date, there ya go. It’s that simple."
"Just got stood up, basically..","I was supposed to meet up with this girl for drinks at 3pm. Around 2:10pm, she texts me asking if we can do 4 instead. Already could tell she had crappy time management skills, hah. I agreed to meet up at 4. I get to the bar and there I am waiting for ONE hour for her to get there. I keep checking with her to see how far she is and she keeps saying “10 minutes”, “sorry almost there”. At the end, I texted her “I’m leaving soon” then soon after, walked out and blocked her number.

This has never happened to me but I shouldn’t have waited like an idiot for that long.

Only spend your time with people who respect it.

Bad dosage of online dating for me today haha



****EDIT (07/06): wow, I wasn’t expecting this post to take off. Thank you everyone for your feedback and for sharing your experience(s). It’s much appreciated. 

Yesterday was a big lesson for me. I now have a decent idea on how to spot someone who’s disrespectful of someone else’s time.
Overall, my experience with online dating has been great so I will keep on going.

PS: I wish I could reply to everyone’s posts but I have a pool and some sun waiting for me on this nice holiday weekend. Salud."
"I’m tired of hearing “If you’re not happy when you are single, you won’t be happy when you are in a relationship.”","Just because someone wants a relationship doesn’t mean that they are unhappy with how life is currently.

Humans are social creatures and as such we crave connection and intimacy with other humans.

I’ve never had a girlfriend myself so I put a lot of effort into OLD (even though it’s been a waste thus far). I’m happy with my life, I have a circle of close friends, many acquaintances and a good support system in my family. That being said there are many things you get from a significant other that you can’t get from friends or family. There are also many experiences that you miss out on.

I’ve seen what a significant other can do for my friends, they carry themselves a little differently and there’s a sparkle in their eye.

Just because I want to experience that for myself doesn’t mean that I am *unhappy* with my life. It means that I’ve seen what a significant other can *add* to your life and I would like to experience sharing my life with someone.

Sure, there are people out there who base their happiness on their relationship or lack thereof and those people need to work on themselves."
Impulsively asked a girl out for the first time ever.,"Sup people.

I (M23) have no dating experience. I asked a girl on a date very suddenly tonight (over FB—I don't see her in person and I don't have her number). 

I've been thinking about asking her for a while but never built up the nerve to do it. Dunno why I did tonight.

(Edit: YES, I know her. Yes, we have texted before. Yes, we chatted before I asked.)

Gentlest rejection I could have asked for for my first time. I thanked her for letting me down easy, we carried on chatting, and now we're hitting up a cafe as friends.

Did not expect that.

I realize not all rejections are as easy as this, but I wanted to share. I'm glad I asked her. 

I don't think this sub will ever have enough JUST DO THE THING posts. So there you go."
"Men, you wasting a lot of time not being straightforward. speak your intentions within the first or second conversation","If you are looking to date, state that. If you want to fuck - tell her you find her very attractive, and if the chance presented, you would love to have sex.... 



When:

When you have a rapport....understand this: vulnerability begets vulnerability. 

why: 

If you are honest upfront, you will know
 whether you are wasting your time... also, if she declines, she knows where you stand - there's no confusion.....

and if you really really like her: you can still have that dynamic

thank you for coming to my Ted Talk 

Also, Don't do it in public obviously, do it when it's a private conversation. Most women have to battle the opinions of other women especially with slut shaming, me too movements being amok.  


Just don't lie about who you are and what you're looking for...

Also,

women primarily know whether or not they want to fuck with you by how you carry yourself, listen to the first minute of ODB-don't U know...... being truthful just brings it to forefront ...

edit: a lot of you men don't understand basic attraction or body language signals.... I don't go up to random women, strike random convos, and blurt it out... you get a convo, if she clearly Happy to talk to you and engages and wants to tell you things it's a good sign.... if she's giving you a look it's a good sign...."
"You will always be able to tell if someone is into you by appling the "" two knock method""","
After being in sales, you'll  realize that sales is alot like the dating world.  In the end you're selling a product. If someone  is interested they will bite. If not  they'll  move on.

Either or you have to be in charge of you and realize the genius of you.

Just like sales I knocked from door to door which was ""b2b"". Grant it the job was shit, but I learned a valuable lesson. This lesson was when to move on and learn ehen someone  isn't interested.

So here comes the two knock method.

Two knocks just means two tries you give to the person to show their interests  in you. After two tries you feel and hear or see nothing you move on.

If on fb you add a girl and you don't  feel anything at first or she's  short give it a second chance. Odds are we're  human. Maybe she was busy or maybe she had somewhere to go. Nevertheless, within that first knock you feel around and gather atmosphere and how she responds to you. If it feels flat then she could be i to someone else and not you.

Second knock is most likely dealing with  hanging out. If she mentions she going somewhere and you wish to come along say hi or something  and she never gives a time its because shes not interested. You only need to ask one two times to hang out or date.  That is the maximum. If she doesnt dm you or text you a time she's  not into you. She's  dropping hints  that she'll  wish to go where she goes and she doesn't  want you around.

Take that hint. Ask her no more. Seek her no more. Contact her no more. If she shows interest from now on it's  her responsibility to find you. She most likely wont because just like in sales the customer will either bite what youre giving or slam the door in your face. 

Two knocks is all you give. When the door opens it will be effortless if not theyre not into what you're  selling. When you internalize that you'll  never have an issue with someone wasting your time because  they'll  never be able to.

"People say you should be a “complete” person before you try to be in a relationship, but how does one become “complete”?",And what determines completeness? What if you can never be fully complete?
Tinder and Bumble for a week. A Meta-analysis.,"**Introduction:** Hello everyone, i'm Alex and i've been visiting this sub-reddit for a year now, i always saw a lot of posts about OLD and how unfair and uneffective it was, especially for the boys. OLD is slowly becoming the standard way in which a guy and a girl meet for a relationship, let's face it, almost everyone has Tinder. So i decided to try myself to take  some results out of it and share with everyone to have a nice discussion about it. Also that's my first post and english is not my main language, if something comes out bad i will modify it as soon as possible, you can also correct me please.

**Background:** I'm a 25 years old guy born in Romania and raised in Rome currently living in Frankfurt,Germany and i don't speak german yet,i study nursing sciences and work in the construction field to pay my course, i don't have anything particular or exciting, i'm not a fancy hipster who loves art and likes to travel and taking photos, i'm not muscular and i don't always have positive vibes going on (wtf). In short, i'm a normal guy with no particular ability just a big interest in social dynamics and the evolution of modern interactions between people.

**Purpose:** To open a big discussion on the effectiveness of the OLD and the cons that comes with it. Also i made a list ofthe main topics:

1. Which app is the most succesfull.
2. What kind of conversations come up during the interactions.
3. Do looks matter? Or is the interaction more valuable?
4. Ghosting percentile.

I need some participation to answer those topics so feel free to share your numbers and experiences.

Also that's not a meta-analysis but that word looks too great in the title to pass on it!

**7 days on Tinder and Bumble:** So i downloaded both apps on 19th of september and set up the profiles with these photos and without any description (added my height because that's one of my strong points).

**Tinder results:** 29 matches

1 girl texted me

3 girls got a text from me

2 girls answered

0 dates set up

**Bumble results:** 14 matches

10 girls texted me

0 dates set up

I should say that all the girls i've talked to ghosted me at one point or the conversation died. There are only 2 left which i'm still talking to and i feel like they will stop texting very soon.

**Conversation examples:**     1.   [https://imgur.com/7twVMcH](https://imgur.com/7twVMcH)

5. [https://imgur.com/bPpp3Ki](https://imgur.com/bPpp3Ki)

**Conclusions:** I have to be honest with you, i couldn't wait for this to be over, it was nice during the first swipes getting a lot of matches, later on the days passed and every conversation i had was not stimulating, poor, boring and most importantly it never came to a conclusion, of a date or a hang out.

I also was very frustrated when they stopped answering out of nowhere and for no reason, to me it felt like these apps are used just like instagram, to show off the appearence and nothing more. Many girls have their instagram on their description (always swiped left on those) and the majority of them are so clichè with the traveling, photography, art, positive vibes, fitness related stuff and so on. I've found no one interesting.

One thing i noticed is that even if i didn't enjoy the swaping thing i would always be attracted towards it, i've found myself continuously  reaching for the phone to swipe and check the girls, i find it very detrimental.

To close this topic out i'd like to say that i don't feel like these apps are made for genuine people with genuine purpouses (sex or relationship), it's more about showing off and texting with someone when bored. I don't feel like if you don't match with some girls or if someone ghosts you or doesn't answer you back means that you have something wrong or that you're not good looking or your eloquence is bad. But those are just my opinions, let me know yours and i hope you liked it, if this discussion has some success i will do a 20 or 30 days osservation. You can test it yourself and make your own post, let's be creative!

\*OLD stands for ""Online dating"""
How to tell if your crush likes you: a guide.,"I've read so many posts about ""she did this, does that mean she likes me?"" or ""he texted me this, does that means he likes me?"" and the answer is always the same: ask your crush out.  If your crush gives you any variation of ""no"" (this includes, but is not limited to: ghosting, a non-committed response, saying he/she really likes you as a friend, saying he/she isn't ready for a relationship, etc.) then the answer is no, your crush isn't into you.  If your crush agrees to the date and actually *shows up* to said date, the answer is yes (as long as you don't screw it up on the date).

I understand you want to know beforehand whether your crush likes you or not to avoid rejection.  But you have to realize that even with the infinite wisdom that is reddit there's no guarantee.  There's a chance your crush will say yes, and there's a chance your crush will say no.  There's only one way to find out: ask."
reconnected with a girl i met 4+ years ago,"It all started in 2015 when i (m25 then, 29 now) first met her (w21 then, 25 now)  via mutual friends. We both were single at the time. She never had a bf before and zero experience at all, on the other side i already had 2 pretty shitty short term flicks. We started to hang out more often and eventually i had a feeling that this could work out, so i did send that risky text, asking her about what she feels. I'm a pretty shy and introverted person so this was anything but easy for me and the reason i did it via text and not in person. She turned me down, not because she didn't like me but because she  felt more like being just friends would feel better to her. Back then i thought ""fuck yeah, i got friendzoned"" and sadly did not invest that much effort into the friendship anymore. I always told myself it was to get over my feeling to her, but in the end it was kind of a dick and selfish move.

Some months passed and i eventually met my now ex gf of the next 4 years. In all that time i maybe had a handful conversations with her, mainly on birthdays and new years etc. It still felt like there was some kind of connection even when we havent seen in all those years and barely talked. I actually was interrested in keeping closer contact and build up on that friendship now that i'm not single anymore and feelings probably couldn't hurt me. But my gf at the time was a really jealous person and did not want me to have contact or a friendship with a girl i used to have feelings for. So we never met in those 4 years, when it actually could have been so easy since she studied in the same town as i was living in for the past 2 years.

2020 rolls in, i'm a fresh single again and actually pretty happy with that. At first i didn't thought about her but she recently started being quite active on social media (she is a cosplayer) and it got my attention. I asked her to met up and she was in for it without any hesitation. It took us almost 2 months to finally set up a day but in the end we got there. Since then we have met more than once, just the two of us and sometimes with mutual friends and this past weekend she slept at my place because we were out with friends and she couldn't catch her train in time. ""Nothing"" happend, we just talked for hours straight (you know that drunken trashtalk you do) until it was already early in the morning and we totally messed up out sleepcycle by only getting 2 hours of sleep in the end.

I had to get up at noon for a football (soccer) game and told her she could stay in my appartment as long as she wants to. As soon as i left for my game i felt like i probably missed a chance there and couldn't help it but text her about how good it felt to reconnect with her and that i haven't been that happy in a long time. I once again send that risky text asking her about what she feels and if she still thinks of me as ""just a friend"". Even if she did, i would have been fine with it now, i learned so much in these years that i wouldn't have called it ""friendzoned again"". To my surprise she answered almost instantly and hell this fact and the actual response cheered me up like nothing did in a very long time.

She is in for the ""let's see where this is going and if it works out, why not"". Later we talked about the sleepover and what would have happend if i made a move that night. She said she probably would have gone with it, but she is very happy i didn't since we both were still a bit drunk and that i showed a lot of respect for her to not take advantage of that. She thinks it was way better to talk about it before and if i haven't send that risky text, she would have done it later that day.

Now here i am, looking forward to dating a wonderful woman and so excited for what is about to happen in the next days, weeks, months or even years. :)

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my story and have a nice day everyone!

&#x200B;

small update: We met again and watched princess mononoke at her place (we both love this anime) and after the movie talked again for hours. I had to leave at midnight because i start working at 6am. On friday she has plans in my town with some friends that want to go to a karaoke bar that is like 10 mins away from my place, so we concluded she can enjoy the evening without having to care about catching a train home because she'll stay at my place for the night."
"Ladies, do you find Asian men attractive?","I'm an Asian man in my 30s and happily married, my wife is Chinese-Vietnamese growing up in the US. She has been with me for 10 years and prior to me she has never ever dated or even attracted to Asian men, despite being friends with many of them. She had always been in relationship with Caucasians. 

As for me, I spent my high school, college and working life in the US, and I was never able to start a relationship with anyone. Nobody ever found me attractive except my wife. But that was 10-20 years ago, and I'm curious whether things have changed these days. 

So ladies, if you don't mind me asking - do you ever find any Asian men attractive, either in real life or as a celebrity? If you do, what's the quality of the man that turned you on the most?"
"Others may come and go, your relationship with yourself is FOREVER"," taken from someone else's comment earlier today.

Date Gone Wrong: When my date burped at me and used me for free dinner,"While I was a grad student (literally last year), I matched with a student athlete on Bumble. She was this giant pretty cute 6'1"" tennis player who could most def crush mere average built 5'9"" boy like myself. We vibed (so I thought) from DMing each other so I asked her out on a dinner date at a Japanese restaurant. When I saw her in real life, she was just as expected; tall. We had a really friendly dinner but there was an issue with the order. She ordered beef teriyaki dinner plate but instead they brought out chicken teriyaki. When it arrived, by her looks, the waiter immediately recognized the mishap so he promised he'll bring the correct order and left the chicken teriyaki since the wait time was long. Without hesitation she started digging into the chicken teriyaki and by the time the beef teriyaki came out, she was already finished with it. She then started inhaling the beef teriyaki like Kirby swallowing all the innocent waddle dees while I was half way done with my dinner plate (guess I was doing most of the talking since she was too busy focusing on eating but damn that was a spectacle). When she finished her second plate, she looked at me straight in the eyes and let out like the loudest burp I've ever heard. Then in a cutesy way she was like ""Oops I ate too fast"" and sat back rubbing her full stomach. In my mind I was like ""What... the... fuck"". If this was all recorded in like a video, you probably can see my hair get blown back due to the sheer force of that expelled gas oof. I was too shook and didn't know what to say at the moment so I just blurted ""bless you"" as if she sneezed haha. Guess she found that funny to as she was laughing too. Anyways I paid for the bill and when I was driving back near campus so we can hang more, she gave me this lame excuse of how she needs to get back to her dorm because her roommates get drunk and she usually takes care of them. I could've nudged her to ditch them just for one night since I wanted to get to know her more but I obliged. After dropping her off, I texted her that I'm down to hangout again but never got any response thereafter.

TLDR; A girl I took on a date ate 2 whole dinner plates and burped at me, to which she later ghosted me after I paid for her dinner bill.

Edit: Thank you all for the recommendation. I'll def focus more on taking my date out for coffee or something relatively cheap but worthy activity. Hope future dates don't burp at me tho lol"
"[Venting] Today is day 1 for me. I just got back from the gym, and I'm a bit of an emotional mess.","Today is day 1 for me. I've been going to the gym for 3 years, and today after a long time, my past kicked me in the balls all over again. I left the gym wanting to cry.

Growing up, I was the shortest dude in my class, and I'm still short compared to people around me. I was one of the few Indian kids. I also wasn't very strong. I used to get singled out by the gym teachers in high school to compete with girls, was never allowed to compete with guys on sports events (btw, I don't think women are weaker than men, or that there is anything wrong with having to compete with women, because hey, I'd love to be as badass as so many women I know). I used to get bullied in so many ways.

""Your mother must be scared to look at you"" ""Why are you so pidgeon chested"" ""Don't worry man, you'll find someone""

I used to get valentine's day cards saying ""I like the smell of your armpits"". I didn't have any BO, but people wanted to see me excited, and then watch my face drop.

The girls who asked me to dance at school parties did it because of a dare, and only wanted to make fun of me.

Guys used to push me into girls, and then everyone would call me a creep. As an Indian guy, I'm already very sensitive to girls not feeling safe around me (yes, we have a terrible reputation, and we collectively need to get better). I hated it. I hated being the reason for other people not feeling comfortable.

So I made myself really smart. I got really creative and artistic. I became a student leader. I made myself weirdly popular, respectable, and untouchable just so all of the bullshit would stop. I never got strong, not for lack of trying. I never attracted or genuinely excited anyone.

At the end of college, I experienced heartbreak because the girl I fell in love with after 3 years of knowing her didn't feel the same way about me, and fell for my best friend. So I graduated, and let myself go completely. The only thing I held on to for dear life was my career.

3 years ago, after a medical emergency, I started getting my act back together again. I started from the bottom of the bottom. I started keeping up with my creative pursuits again. I started doing everything I could to be the best man I can. After 3 years, I've only now managed to achieve where most people start. So I'm calling today day 1 with the hopes and dreams that one day I'll be good enough for someone to appreciate me for just existing, and for that person to accept everything I have to give to them. But I'm also emotional, because I don't know if I even have the potential anymore, and I'm operating on 0 confidence.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: I'm trying but don't know if I'll ever be good enough to be able to fall in love because of past experiences, and that made me emotional."
Biggest dating mistakes I’ve made,"22f here, Let this help you guys out, coming from a screw up like me. Learn from this, and avoid doing what I did. 

1. Seeing every guy/girl you meet as a potential love life. 

The truth is a big pill that’s hard to swallow, but that mindset is a sign you’re desperate to fall inlove. Don’t be. Falling in love with you is a privelege reserve to only one person. Stop looking at a person and thinking this could be the one. That’s just adding pressure to yourself and unwanted expectations along the way. 

2. Opening up to people too much. 

I used to think that people will open up to you if you open up to them. No, not really. Well,at least not immediately. 

Let them earn the real you. It takes time. 

3. Rushing 

There was this boy I met, Philip, It was going good for the first part. But I think I scared him away because I wanted to be with him as soon as possible. 

You see everybody is afraid of the idea of committing, thats why dating is hard. We’re afraid of the risks.

4. Focusing too much on a person 

Enjoy your life. If he doesnt reply, so what? Then go do something you enjoy. WatchTV, go jogging, talking to him isnt the only thing you can do. 

If he cancels, then go make other plans. 

The only person you should focus on is you. 

To whoever reads this, Love is hard. But how do you know you can love someone else, if you cant love yourself ? 

🌸"
Ghosting is just rude and hurtful,"So I'm messaging this girl back and forth for a week straight before the date flirting, getting to know each other etc. 

We go and have the best first date Roller Skating.. no times of silence, both having a laugh. After the Roller skating we drove back near hers. Watched the stars whilst chatting some more.. she came to me for a kiss before we parted ways. No indications of the fact she didn't have a good time.

Following days replies slow dramatically with ""work is really busy"" ""might not be able to see you at weekend i suddenly might be busy"" then they just stopped. I'm sorry but I've been brought up so if you just don't like someone.. or the chemistry wasnt there you could just tell them. How difficult can it be to say ""I'm sorry i didn't feel a connection, good luck dating"" instead its radio silence doubting everything you did on the date not knowing if it was something you said or whether she'd simply started talking to someone else. Its emotionally draining to put your heart into dating for it to get so easily rejected. 

TLDR; A week of constant messaging from online dating. 
1st Date went really well (at least i thought so).
Then a couple slow replies then gone.
Ghosting is simply a rude no backbone way of rejecting someone. 
If you're someone that does it please consider the other persons feelings."

Ways for guys to improve your online dating profile.,"When you date online, Tinder, Bumble, OKC, you are literally selling yourself. 
You are telling the world:
""hey pick this one, I'm not a serial killer and I'm actually a pretty cool guy to be around."" 

That being said, here are a few tips for your dating profile to help with your sales from fellow swiper.

 Pick your brand and stick with it. I'm talking to you 25-34 year olds. This could actually work for girls too but I haven't seen many girl's profiles to give an accurate assessment, maybe you guys can post some girls tips in the comments. 

Back to it: Perception is reality. Seriously think about who you are trying to attract.

Tip 1: If you have a picture with a kid, I'm going to assume it's yours. 
If you don't want me to assume it's yours, don't have a picture with a kid. 
It doesn't make you seem eligible or paternal, it doesn't send off signals to women that you are okay with kids or want them in the future, it makes you seem like someone who already has a kid. 

Nothing wrong with having kids, but if that's not what you're going for and you don't want people to assume that the newborn on your chest is your kid, don't do it.

Tip 2: If every picture on your page is 6 of you and your closest bros at the bar/a wedding/night out, chances are you all look the same and I don't know who you are. 
One pic, maybe two is okay. 
It shows me that you're socialized and people have deemed you worthy of being around but anymore than that is straight up chaos.
I shouldn't have to work to identify you on your own profile.
I don't want to see your entourage, I want to see you. This can be especially bad for you if the guy you are standing next to is hotter than you. 

Because now I'm looking at your friend thinking:""okay nice.."" and then the next to last image is in fact, you alone, not the friend I had been looking at in 6 of your other pictures. 
Oof, welcome to shadowlands aka digital friendzone: a place where even if you are cute, I know I can't swipe on you because I already acknowledged your friend was the most attractive one in the crew and planned what our kids will look like in the future. 

Limit the bromance pictures.

Tip 3: No matter how funny you think it is, you wearing a speedo/banana bathing suit/being seminaked/wasted/
from that one time things got crazy with your boys doesn't really paint the best picture of you. 
Same goes for doing foolish, dangerous stuff.
I'm talking to you, guy welding in your underwear with no protection. 
Get your shit together man. 


Tip 4: If you have a pictures where you are suggestively embracing females similar in age, I'm going to assume she is your ex and you can't let go or she is your current partner in some poly relationship thing. At the very minimum you've swapped bodily fluids before. That's just what's going to happen.¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Tip 5: If you have a picture of your dog, you should be in the picture with your dog. You are a package deal with the dog, the dog doesn't come on its own, he doesn't need his own image, it's your profile.

Tip 6: I dont give a fuck about your truck. I am from California, I am not fluent in Chevy.
Also why? Why would you put your car on your dating profile? Maybe some people are totally down for that but do you really want people to date you for your car?  

In hindsight, I realize this may be a geographic thing. 

Maybe there are some women who need to know you have a truck before they swipe right on you. 
If you fall into an area with those requirements, carry on. 
I just want there to be more to your life than your lift kit.

The same goes for profile bios like: 
I own my own house. 
Like okay,
my guy, we get it, you're adulting. 

It's important to note that owning your house in no way directly correlates to you having your shit together. 

Tip 7: After hella swipes, unless you are sitting pretty at 12.5 on the hotness scale, chances are your face is not that interesting on its own, so write something in your bio. 

ProTip: Noone gives a fuck about you liking tacos. You're basic as fuck.

And do not put something super douchey like: 

""No one reads these things,"" - They do.

""You want to know something just ask me."" - hey, what kind of toothpaste do you use?

 ""Not going to waste time filling this out"" - News flash bro, you just filled it out. 

Most of these things have a pretty short character limit. 

You're inability to sit still for 5 minutes and describe yourself says more about you than you think.

Stop being difficult and put something in there so I can start a conversation with you about something substantial outside of ""I like your face."" 

It's not edgy or ironic, it's annoying. 
Why show up in the first place if you're going to half-ass it? 
I get it, you're a rebel, ""blahh fuck the patriarchy"" or whatever. 

Don't use your bio to complain about ""No one ever ever responds on these things."" 
It's probably because you don't have anything worth talking about on your profile and 3 of your pictures are subjectively funny memes, just saying.

News flash 2.0: You're not cooler than the rest of us lonely bastards trying to connect with someone to make existence you know, less lonely. 

'Do not pass go' tips:

Don't take pictures holding money. -just......why?

Don't take pictures chugging alcohol. - ""hellzz yeah, I drank a lot of posion really fast, in complete disregard for my abused liver."" Yum. Boyfriend material.

Don't use your golden days/high school pictures if you don't still look like that. 
- That is a lie. You should not lie.

If you have kids, put it in your bio or in your features that you have them. 

Don't surprise me with your four kids after I enjoy talking to you for a bit, that is a dirty trick.

If you're bald, don't use pictures where you had hair, that is also a lie. 
See above about lying. Chicks dig bald guys. 
Live your truth man.


Tip 8: Stop using cropped pictures, cutting people out or putting emojis on their faces and giving the excuses of ""I don't take pictures.""
I still see that chick's hand on your stomach from that time at the beach.
Motherfucker, take a new picture. 
Make an effort. 


On second thought, all that extra work of cropping and pasting probably took longer than you just taking a picture. 

And for fuck's sake, smile."
"As a short guy, women have destroyed all self confidence I've ever had.","I dont even know where to begin. I'm so beaten down and just sad at this point that I dont even think I'm worth it to anyone. I'm 25, 5'4 and am athletic/skinny as I mainly just rock climb for exercise. I think I look pretty good, abs and whatnot, I'm just not ""big"". I dont set the bar high for myself, I know I cant date women much taller then me. I have almost no expectations for women other then dont be overweight or rude to people who dont deserve it. Other than that, I have super low expectations. I've joined a few dating apps and jeez are they soul crushing. I'm up front about my height and get almost zero matches or even interests. The only women who tend to show anything are overweight women. I'm sorry that's a standard I set for myself and I make sure I'm in good shape. I'm not attracted to overweight women. Now I dont know where I sit on my looks, gay men tend to love me and that's cool and all but wrong team. I've had some extremely good looking women in my life that like to hang out with me and keep me around but never in a romantic way. Which is fine, I dont expect myself to get some of the girls I've made friends with, as they are straight up 8s or 9s. So I dont think I'm a bad looking guy then. I feel like I'm just going to end up alone because it's not fair to even be in a relationship with someone you're not physically into. I'm just so defeated. I cant be the ""man"" women want and I dont have much energy left to put into this. I just dont get why a lot of short women dont date around their height. I'm too short for the short girls and I'm too short for the average girls. I feel like if I say any of this out loud people will just attack me for being a woman hater. I mean women physically change their appearance to make themselves look better with makeup but I'm too short to date even though were the same height? Ugh. I'm just sad.

Edit: I understand you may be going through the same struggles but some of you have a lot of hate behind your words. I dont believe in spreading hate like that, even if I've been the one suffering in silence.

Edit 2: Alright guys, I wanna thank a lot of you for the support. My takeaways from this, there are a lot of women who care, some that dont. A lot of other angry short guys here. Most importantly, do not say any of this in my normal life, suck it up and pretend there isn't a problem and just live life. Oh and dont use dating apps."
Just joined a dating app. Why do girls always say that “they are bored or not looking for anything”.,Just made an online dating profile. So far every girl I’ve met asks me my intentions and I tell them that I’m interested in dating. They seem to always come back with the response along the lines of “lol I’m on here because I’m bored”. I feel that there are so many other things to do if you are bored though.
Anyone else in the cycle of Work-->Home-->Gym-->Sleep-->Work?,"I leave for my work at 6 in the morning, and leave the office around 4. I am home by 430 and HELLA tired so I take a nap (usually 5pm to 7).

That leaves me literally 2 hours to myself before I head to bed at 9PM so I get my 8 hours of rest. I use this time to hit the gym from 730 to 830, by 9 I'm back to bed.

I have a great friends group and hang out with them whenever we can. No problems socially even talking to girls. The question for me is, how the heck am I to find someone with such little time on my hands? Where would I even meet them?
I would really appreciate some srrious replies to this question. Thank you."
"Ladies, have you ever just picked on the fact that one of your guy friends like you without them telling you and what gave it away?","I’ve heard some girls are oblivious but some girls can tell pretty quickly. For those of you that could tell a guy is into you without him telling you, how did you pick up on it?"
Is there anyone who started dating in their 20s? What was it like?,"I'm 23 [F] and I've never been on a date or in a relationship. I don't even know how to be friends with a guy. 

I don't know where it's coming from, but I feel this pressure to date and find someone because I feel like I'm falling behind everyone else. I know if I was going to be in a relationship, I only want something serious because I'm not really interested in hookups. 

I downloaded Okcupid and Hinge, but I'm not  matching with anyone because at the back of my mind, I know that's not how I'd like to meet people. However, it's my only option at the moment because I'm not very social. I've been thinking about just going on dates as a way to become more familiar around men and then maybe going out more.

Edit: I'm trying my best to read and respond to every comment. I really appreciate all of your answers and I'm glad to know that I'm not alone."
"A happy post: I'm in my second relationship, and I couldn't be happier!","So, I've been in a rather unstable relationship half a year ago, my ex was very uncommunicative, depressed and ended things after half a year of dating.

I met my current girlfriend on Tinder. We quickly realized there was a connection between us. After one month of dating, we decided to make things official and now we're in a committed relationship.

And she is the sweetest girlfriend I could think of! She's cute, witty and clever. We have a similar taste in music, similar interests, life goals and ideas of the ideal relationship. Also we are sexually very compatible.

She wrote me a poem, and tomorrow I'm surprising her with a letter :)

I was pretty close to stop looking for dates online,  and try my luck in real life. But for once in my life I'm so happy I procrastinated!

To all the singles: Enjoy your single time. It prepares you for your next relationship. And to people in relationships: I wish you the best for your future, and may your relationship be a good one!"
Do creepy men ruin it for all the good guys trying to date women?, Women deal with creeps all the time. I can't blame them if they're hesitant of most guys but there are good ones out there. I feel since women get a lot of bad dudes hitting on them they have their guard up more and it just makes it harder for genuinely good men to date them.
Slept with a pair if twins separately not knowing it wasn't the same person,"I hooked up with a girl from tinder. A year later  I see a girl who I think is her on tinder also. I couldn't have remembered the name if my life depended on it. I ask if she wants to come over after we matched, the conversation was was consensually direct being that it was 11:30 on a sunday. I didn't mention that I recognised her. At that point I wasn't really sure if it was her and she hadn't placed me so I thought I was just having deja Vu . She said yes and came over. After we hooked up I said ""you look familiar"",I  wanted to get it out in the air because at this point I felt like I was going mad with her not remembering me. ""We've definitely hooked up before"". Her face went a little white. You know I'm a twin, right? I said ""no? ,  How am I supposed to know that?"" . ""Did you sleep with my sister"" she asked. I then said ""yea I guess so... Shit"". The whole thing seemed a bit surreal . Her sister, from a year ago, was living at her dad's friends place near her school where she was located. It was the same area where I was working in the city . I asked if she lived with the extremely religious family who knew her dad. She said that it was definitely her sister. I played nice. Trying to make it not awkward. I felt stupid for making the mistake and in disbelief of the situation. I invited her to the living room to smoke some weed and I had some cookies on the table, we chatted for about 30 minutes but it was 12:30 on a Sunday with work only 7 hours away, I said I should be getting to bed. (I had made this point  prior to her coming over which she stated she understood and was fine with) . This is probably one of the weirder non kink things that has happened to me."
I think one of the most nerve wrecking part about a first date is not the date or the person but being in a pubic setting.,"For me, I feel like the hardest thing is being in a public area. Like a coffee shop or a restaurant. You guys meet up or maybe you guys go there together and everyone knows near you that it’s a date and they might even know it’s a FIRST date depending on how you guys act around each other and all the eyes are on you. I hate drawing attention."
Deleted all the apps,"I went and deleted the dating apps from my phone. I was becoming too  enamored with the hits on my profile, the flirty conversations, which almost always lead to nothing. Time to be in the present and read a good book instead of worrying about who swipes which way on my picture. I know I may be back on them in a while, but right now I need to breathe. And be okay with being alone."
I just went on my first date ever!,"Idk, if this is really the right place for this since, I don't need advice. But, I just went on my first date, it was so much fun (after getting over the nervousness of it all), and I'm just really buzzing. But I don't have anyone to tell, so I figured I'd tell Reddit."
No ghosting pact,"Can we all agree that ghosting sucks? I think it’s terrible and I would rather have someone tell me straight to my face that I suck. 

If you all are interested in trying to end ghosting (a ridiculous concept) then let’s all agree to not do it anymore. 

The only reasons it’s acceptable to ghost (feel free to add) 

1. Fear of safety
2. Person treated you terribly 
3. Abusive
4. You never met (debatable/ should I remove this one)


If the other person was decent and you just weren’t feeling it. Just be straight up and say it! 

On flip side if they end it with you, don’t be nasty and move on. 


Deal?"
Being attractive isn't only based on looks,"It is true. Attractive people are treated better by everyone.  

Being attractive is based on good looks, yes. However, your personality, self confidence,  and how you treat people is more important."
Ever hooked up with someone you had a major crush on but never thought in a million years that they would be interested?,"This happened to me a couple days ago. She was a former work colleague who I’ve really really fancied for a while but never in my wildest dreams did I think I had a chance. But we’d been flirting for a couple weeks via text and then it actually happened. I don’t know if I’ve ever had a dream come true before, but this was actually it!

Let’s hear your stories!"
Stop letting them rent space in your head.,"They don’t deserve to live in your head, kick them out. When you find yourself thinking about them get mad and evict those thoughts. If they don’t bring you joy or a sense of fulfillment, kick it to the curb. You control your happiness and it starts with what you think about."
The apps are wearing me down,"So I matched with a guy on Tinder last night and we talked for like 3, 4 hours. It was a good conversation IMO, and toward the end of it I asked if he wanted to meet this week and he said he could do Friday. We continued talking on and off today, just general chatting because I was working but I wasn't unresponsive. I just went to message him and see how his night's going and saw that he unmatched me.

I'm not looking for an explanation as to why; I know I won't get one and it could be a million things. I know it was just a few hours but it seemed like we have a lot in common and have similar senses of humor, and I was excited about the date. 

The carelessness people treat each other with on dating apps is just so frustrating and these tiny rejections are starting to wear me down. I took a 5-month break from OLD at the beginning of this year and think I might need another one.

</rant>

Edit: Probably should have mentioned this to begin with but want to add that this feeling is the culmination of 10 years of being on apps on-and-off and watching people get less and less considerate as time goes by. This particular incident isn't an isolated one; it's something similar happens more often than not when I match with someone. This isn't me trying to say anyone owes me anything if we haven't even gone out yet, but it's hard not to get bogged down by it.

Also I've asked guys out after just a few messages and then had them turn out to be racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. I'd rather waste a few hours chatting online and getting to know them a bit than actually spend the time getting ready for a date and the money on drinks only to find out they're a piece of shit ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
Lost That Loving Feeling,"Anyone feel from being in a bad break up that it effects their ability to love again? Ive been single for 3 years now and in this time no one really has caught my attention. I've dated but I don't usually see someone for more than 2 months. After my breakup I focused a lot on myself and I think this has changed my mindset. I recently went to my best friend's wedding and noticed that love is something that I lack and want but I don't think I'm capable of anymore.


When I saw how they looked into each other's eyes at first made me feel like the feeling they have is something immature. Something I use to believe in but no longer. Almost like something I grew out of. It wasn't until I made the best man speech it really hit me that maybe I'm wrong. My friend was kind of the goofball friend who fell in love in college and completely changed. He's a doctor now with a wife. She changed his life and made him a better person. 


I feel that no one really excites me like how they feel. They were very fortunate to have fallen for each other at a very young age and didn't experience what I have. I  want someone I can grow with and share memories with like them. Unfortunately, these things aren't something you can just ""get"" but is acquired over time. I just feel maybe I'm the problem. People lacking experience usually fall in love quickly were I feel the opposite. Nothing or no one excites me. Makes me feel like cause of my past the feeling doesn't come to me anymore. Anyone else feel this way?"
To all us guys struggling.,"You’ve heard every bit of advice about a profile, dress up, take better photos, be confident blah blah blah.

Objectively being more physical attractive on dating sites will get you more matches, it just will. I’m not a physically attractive dude, I am about average I don’t work out but I eat very well and firmly believe I’m repping team dad bod. I’ve been single for about six months and I’ve been dating seriously for maybe 4-5 weeks at this point. 

In that time what I’ve noticed is that every genetic piece of advice you get is both correct and incorrect. I am not physically fit or attractive I have a relatively attracted face but objectively my female friends have put me at like a 5/6 I’m as they’d put it “Fuckable but nothing on Ryan Reynolds.” 

I offset this with my personality, now the issue with online dating is how can you use a personality to hook someone in a few paragraphs/A photo.

What’s worked for me is embracing my flaws, I’ve got a picture on my profile of me imitating fat Thor. I’ve got one where I’m in a fucking dragon onesie screeching like a fool. They are fun photos and I’ve gotten more conversations out of those than any of my professional pictures, which I also have on because I’m dressed up and look nice. I tell people I’m a massive nerd in my bio and people ask about those hobbies. You don’t have to be Ryan Reynolds to get matches, but you do need to create a hook that makes someone WANT to talk to you.

I’m not saying it’s perfect or guaranteed, but I’ve gotten more success out of going all out and embracing my flaws and making jokes out of them than trying to hide them.

Hope this helps some of you out there 😀"
It is weird for a woman to ask a guy out?,"I mean it’s 2020 and stuff but still, how would you feel if a girl hit you up for a date??"
Anyone else ever felt like your social circles are too small to efficiently meet people you could date?,"I’m kind of at that point, school just went online, my work circle is small and I’m not interested in anyone there, and my friends don’t know girls I would be interested in. I have just turned 21 today though, so hopefully all this covid stuff blows over sooner than later and I can go out to the bars and have fun."
Totally smitten and overwhelmed,"I have been going to a social meetup once a week and I feel like I have just met that 1 in 1,000,000,000 person. Its so serendipitous. I cant express how I feel. Its like I am weightless and walking on clouds. I have been out of the dating world for 5 years, having dated 2 girls for 2 years each back in university. There girls were in my friend group so we didnt really date; it just kind of fell into place. 

I definitely get a reciprocal vibe from her. There is tons of blushing, nonsensical laughing and kind of blank staring for long periods of time. After struggling with crippling anxiety for years, its like a massive weight lifted. I now have no idea how to proceed. Although we get along, I definitely feel my nerves creeping up. Its like a nervous excitement. I want to share this and express my interest but am not sure how to proceed without it being desperate.  Im running around like a chicken with my head cut off"
"So, when a girl repeatedly says yes to a date, but won't actually agree to a specific day/time, is she saying yes or no?","...or, third option: are you insane like she's making you feel with her mixed messages?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Jeezum Crow!! (as they said in my redneck highschool) This thread blew up!

Because I can't reply to everyone, I just want to say thanks so much for all your replies, the concensus is more or less unanimouse that **""If it's not a Hell Yes, it's a No"".** The *reasons* for interpreting such mixed signals as ""No"" are still worth debating.... In my case I am lucky because I can be sure it's not due to lack of interest or any intention of manipulation (because the female is too sweet, flirty, and humble for those to be plausible). But it definitly may be another dude in the picture or more likely (I hope) an oppressive, toxic family situation that is the root of my woes.

Love you all, as I always will.

PS/ 2nd Edit: I'd like everyone to remember that while many women do give mixed signals and ""lead men on"" the motive for that is not always manipulation! In some cases, the confusion is due to the woman genuinely desiring a relationship but being tentative or even just plain scared due to previous bad relationships or trauma. All humans want some form of closeness, but most have been hurt by closeness as well. You might say the very thing we all want most is the same thing which has hurt us all the most."
I didn’t plan on bringing in my 30th birthday alone. But here I am. And that’s ok!,"I was flaked on not once but twice yesterday by two different guys lol. Guy #1 “loosely” invited me to dinner then stopped responding. Guy #2 was supposed to meet up with me for drinks then 20 mins before proclaimed that he “lost his wallet” so couldn’t make it anymore. 

So, you know what I did? I went out absolutely solo and that’s ok! One thing I have learned while dating is not to put your happiness in the hands of others. People will flake. You’ll get mixed signals. You’ll think everything is going great and then it dissipates. It’s all a part of the race I suppose. 

I’m at a turning point in my life where I’m becoming ok with being alone. I’m learning to celebrate and enjoy my own company. I know my worth. I’m intelligent, beautiful, smart and pretty funny if I must say so myself. 

One day, I’ll find someone who is interested in being an extension of me. I do want a relationship but I won’t force one just to have someone. So as I woke up on this “monumental day”, I laughed, I smiled, even cried a little bit. But I’m here and I’m present. Happy Birthday to me."
She said yes!!!,"I FINALLY DID IT!  

I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiancée, and guess what? 

SHE SAID YES!!!

We met on coffee meets bagel a year and a half ago. She’s a interior designer/fitness instructor. I’m an accountant/consultant. On paper,  I didn’t think we would have anything in common or even any chemistry but here I am, looking at websites in how to plan a wedding!! 

I’ve been carrying this ring with me for the past two months! I wanted to do it on New Year’s Eve but another engagement stole the show. I was wondering if I should wait until Valentines Day but maybe too obvious. 

But over the weekend, we decided to go out of town as we found this nice hotel in overlooking the water. We were just enjoying each other’s company on the balcony with a warm blanket. And I decided to just go for it! 

"
Being together a long time doesn't mean it's a good relationship,"If you are ever in the position where you are thinking about ending a long term relationship, if the only thing making you stay is the amount of time you've been together, that one factor isn't worth staying. Now, if you want to try and work it out, by all means do so. But don't feel like you have to sacrifice or compromise your feelings for someone you have been with for awhile. It's never too late to start over and find that special person. Who knows, someone new could make you feel in six months how someone else made you feel in ten years. So if you're reading this and you feel like ending a long-term relationship would make all that time a waste, or would make you look stupid for staying so long, or for any other reason, it's ok. Not everything works out. That's life. It isn't anyone's fault. Just have the strength to follow your heart and if it tells you to move on, start looking for someone new. You can do that! I believe in you!"
"Reminder: male or female, your lack of success on a dating app is most likely not your fault and in no way a fair reflection of you (or how I deleted my apps and started loving myself and felt happier)","You don't need me to tell you about the woes many people, regardless of gender and orientation, deal with on dating apps. Feeling like they're not good looking enough, like they're not interesting enough, not tall enough or make enough money, etc. Let me tell you, I've been there so many times before. I've been on and off dating apps over the past several years, all at different times in my life , and for different reasons (looking for something casual, something serious, just out of boredom)

I've had a decent amount of success on these apps (by success I mean simply landing a date with a girl, regardless of whether anything more happened with her after), but I've definitely had more failures than anything. And like everyone else, I'd beat myself up and constantly wonder what I did wrong: did I not choose the right pics? Was my opening line poor? Was I too straightforward? And so on

This bothered me for a long time, because I genuinely thought I wasn't good enough for a lot of people. But this past year I've made a genuine big effort to improve myself, physically and mentally. I'm 20 days away from turning 30, yet I'm in the best shape of my life, I look fantastic and have been dressing better, and I've finally learned what it's like to be a truly confident person. Also importantly: I've been noticing a lot of girls checking me out, smiling at me, etc

Why do I bring this up? Because this past weekend I wanted to ask a girl out that I'd been crushing on, only to find out she has a boyfriend. I wasn't necessarily bummed about it, more like ""Well, I don't really know anyone else I'm interested in, maybe I could get on Bumble and see what's up""

Then I stopped myself, and I thought, I've made all this positive, great progress so far, why mess it up now? I'll probably get on Bumble or Tinder, not get many decent matches, and then be left wondering, again, if it's because I'm not tall enough or not make enough or whatever. I've gotten enough good vibes from people in real life to know I can do better than what I'd potentially get on an app

I know I'm not the only person who's keeping away from dating apps for the sake of their confidence/anxiety, and I also know that plenty more people still struggle because they think they're not enough

But you know what? You are dudes. All of you. Are you a little shy or introverted, maybe awkward and not sure how to talk to people? That's perfectly fine. There's lots of people who are like that. Are you worried you're not good looking enough? You're probably better looking than you give yourself credit for, and if you feel like there's room for improvement, it's not as daunting as it may seem: get yourself in shape and get some new clothes. You'll see how wonderful it all feels

This isn't something that happens overnight either. I've been working on myself since the beginning of the year, and with each passing week I'm still learning new things about myself, about mindfulness and confidence, about positive self-esteem and loving myself. It hasn't all been smooth sailing; I've hit a few road bumps along the way, but something else I've learned is how to better deal with those bumps. Setbacks don't feel so bad anymore; the highs are gradually getting higher, and the lows aren't as low

This can be you, because if I can do it, you can too. It's just going to take a lot of patience, dedicated effort, and persistence. If you stick with it, you'll get there, I promise

But wherever you are right now in your dating life, just remember: don't take Tinder, Bumble, whatever you're using, too seriously. Most of the people on there are either on there for the attention, don't know what they're looking for, or have such ridiculous expectations that they're probably not worth the trouble anyways (if a girl's deciding factor is how tall you are, or a guy decides based on how quickly you sleep with him, they weren't for you to begin with)

These two pics are from the last month or two. They're both probably two of the best pics anyone's ever taken of me (for different reasons):
https://imgur.com/7uDsRTI

https://imgur.com/0ygcDPg

Sometimes when I'm feeling a bit low I look at them and remind myself, shit, look how far you've come, and how much farther up you could go still. And, again, I'm just under three weeks away from hitting 30. I know people from high school (my age and younger) who've let themselves go, have basically given up, etc. I wasn't the best looking or most athletic when I was in high school or college, but I wouldn't trade what I have right now for anything

Again, this isn't something that is unique to me. I don't have any special powers or talents or shortcuts that got me here. It just takes times and perseverance. But I don't have a doubt in my mind that all of you could reach where I am too (if you're not there already) 

Love yourself, and the right person will come around. That's why I decided against installing a dating app: I'm not in a rush, and I have too much on my plate to be worrying about why I'm not getting the matches I want

Thank you for reading. I'd love to hear from all of you, whether you're happily in a relationship, on your way up like I am, or struggling (which, by the way, is perfectly, utterly fine. We've all been there). Share your stories, advice, suggestions, whatever"
Couples who still say I LOVE YOU deserve to go to jail,I'm joking I'm just salty cuz I've been lonely for over a year now
"Before asking r/Dating for advice, consider talking it out with the person you're dating","Hey r/dating! 

I've been an active user on this sub for a few weeks now and I just want to start off by saying how much I appreciate those on here who offer empathy to those who are getting ghosted, friend-zoned, misled or straight up rejected. It always hurts, but nobody is alone in this and we all feel the same pain at some point or another. So thank you to the ""empathizers"" out there <3

Here to offer some basic advice, title says it all really. If you're coming to this sub asking for advice on how to understand or interpret something about the person you're dating (what they're looking for, what it means if they text at X frequency, are they dating other people, do they see me as a lover or just a friend, etc.), often times the best solution is simply to talk about it openly with that person. Of course your approach and delivery will matter (e.g. don't come off as assuming they are sleeping with other people because your question might be interpreted as an accusation), but generally I think this advice is more applicable than people might think. I understand that sometimes it's just a question of courage: it's much easier to create a throwaway and ask this sub knowing whatever the responses are, it's not the response you'll necessarily get from the person you're dating. But sooner or later, the only way to get that response is to ask them directly. 

Well that's it. Kudos to everyone who are putting themselves out there despite your past shitty relationships, your rejections, and your insecurities. For the vast majority of us, *dating is* ***not*** *easy*, so for all the would-be lovers out there, keep your chin up and remind yourself that whatever stress you might be feeling when dating someone new, chances are the other person is just as stressed as you! So be open, honest, talk it out and leave the rest to fate.

Good luck to you all!"
Modern Dating: an observation,"To start off: I speak in “us”, “our” and “we” on occasion, because at the end of the day, we’re all in this together. Whether we want to accept it or not.

Here are some things I’ve noticed about dating, and dating apps in general, that might be summarized best with a comment from a conversation I had with my dad: 

“The issue here is that you’re trying to force something to work that, inherently, does not work.”

While there are success stories from people who have found love and stability via these means, I’m keying in on the fact that those are far and few between heartbroken reports of ghosting, catfishing, benching, breadcrumbing, half-night stands, and all of these other trendy coined terms to describe the slaughter going on out there in the dating world today. 

It has become easier and more “effective” to build rotations of 4+ people and networks of individuals that require little to no emotional investment or effort, are a text away from hooking up, with almost Amazon-like speed deliveries of a person from the internet to the flesh, to satisfy instant, and likely fleeting, carnal needs. First sign of trouble or friction? Next! Get back on that app and keep swiping, keep avoiding, stay expecting. Chasing that perfect “hit”. 

(Sure signs of abuse are exempt here, once you know, you go.)

Let’s say you develop genuine feelings, and somehow decide to date a person seriously moving forward. Can you guarantee that they’re not using the app while dating you? No! Can you guarantee that they meant it when they said they’re not on the app anymore? No! Among other scenarios that can play out here, the point is, TRUST has likely been lost in the foundation of the relationship, wherever it may end up...Unless both parties make it their business to respect and maintain it. Therefore, most relationships are already set up for failure, and at this rate, none of us should really be surprised that it turns out that way. 

Which leads me to the next point: most responses to dating failures seem so numb and devoid of true passion and deep reflection, that there is no real fight remaining for relationship building and sustaining as a purpose.

Relationships require time and attention, and it’s far too tempting nowadays to siphon that time and attention into superficial things like social media, likes, and that perfect selfie. Why? Because these “things” likely light up the reward systems in our brains like the addicts we’ve become, making the addiction to gratification and stimulus more important than our boring, monotonous, real-life connections to one another as human beings. Why settle down with one person and pay attention to building and growing slowly with them, when you can indulge your senses on the buzzes and vibrations of validation, flashing lights, fancy animations, jazzy notifications, bells, and whistles, and haptic feedback from your smartphone to dive back into the endless possibilities of the digital double life?

Also, recognizing a genuine connection in its infancy, and having it suddenly disappear without a trace no longer has the emotional protection and m support of a strong and morally grounded community to catch it and guide it back to where it needs to be either nurtured or ended with maturity. This may be a side effect of the absence of delayed gratification... massive-scale learned helplessness, or even the evolution of snack-sized wisdom in memes failing as substitutes for bonding over discussion and rumination on real issues and the reasons behind them. 

Instead, it’s seen as “Oh well, that’s that. Tough beans. Just move on.”...Insert a collective, giant, proverbial shoulder shrug. 

Modern dating has become a careless, free-for-all with no common standard of operation nor agreement, lacking measures of excellence. And most importantly, no real marker for when to stop and unplug! Too often I’m seeing people accept these destructive behaviors as natural, to the point where it is evolving into something common and acceptable. It’s being rewarded...and what is rewarded, continues.

And here is my last point: Many of us are failing to call a spade a spade. 

How many people have intentionally removed themselves from sex and dating long enough to truly reflect within upon the behaviors and beliefs they’re bringing to the table that mimic.. parents, role models, or TV? How much of this is learned and replayed through us, ruled by emotions only, without logic and reason? Versus a tried and true collection of “Yes, this works because it works, and I’ve spent time with my peers and colleagues to elaborate upon why it works...and observed the results that show that it works.”

How many are unconsciously seeking to satisfy some repetition-compulsion to repeat past trauma in new relationships to gain a sense of control and power where they once felt helpless and weak? Do we have the courage to address these topics?

How many people are willing to admit that they’re wrong? And that we’re probably going about this the wrong way? 

How many of us are willing to do the real, ugly, painful work so we can finally have healthy relationships with each other?

—-

TL; DR: We’re on the fast track to becoming a bunch of instant gratification addicts, trying to force things to work in modern dating that inherently, don’t work."
30 day challenge of asking how new ladies,"So I have a heart condition that is getting worse and worse, I may not have much time left on the earth. I am seeing a heart specialist about getting a defibrillator placed in my heart, but that has its own list of complications and risk.ANYWAYS, i am 26 yr old male.  I decided that since I may die at any moment due to sudden cardiac death, why not take risk in the dating world. Because of this I am going to be on a 30 day challenge of asking out a  minimum 1 new girl each week, a total stranger, it could be a gorgeous girl i see at the grocery store, or a cute girl at the gym. No more going back and forth in my head ""cmon man, just walk up to her, tell her shes beautiful and ask for her number"" I am just gonna do it.will keep yall updated on how this goes each week.   Give this  an upvote to hold myself accountable.  


EDIT\*\*\*   
 okay so I asked this girl out from the library, she was sitting in the cubicle next to me, ive seen her around and we have exchanged words in the past so she isnt a total stranger, but we are going to dinner Tuesday night! (:

Edit 2/13/19
Sooo went out last night with the girl. Dinner went great, she had a blast. She left her juul in my car last  night and she wants to hangout today and have me drop it off(hanging out the next day seems like a slippery slope, so I told her I would swing by on my way to work and drop it off).   I also have a hilarious NSFW story about the date but Idk if it would ruin the wholesomeness of the post, so maybe I'll just keep it to myself....anyways dinner went great and she invited me to go see hippie sabotage with her, not sure If I'm gonna take her up on that.   
Have a really busy work schedule the rest of the week but hope to ask out at least one more girl by Sunday. 

EDIT 3-10-19
sorry for being totally awful at updating this. Okay so it's basically been around 30 days. I've been super busy with work and applying for grad school. Anyways...um life's been great! Having another doctors appointment the end of the month. The ladies have been great! TBH I started getting really picky with the girls I felt worth asking, only cause I really wanted to be excited about talking to the girl. One big issue I ran into was that the girls seemed to be much more interested than I was. One girl I've been seeing regularly, I go over to her place and she's made me dinner and I've taken her on a few dates, starting to know her sister pretty well also. This is bad cause Idk if I'm looking for a LTR. 
Another girl has been a blast hanging out with, but she seems more invested than I am. We are going camping next weekend so I'm thrilled about that. 
Another girl was really sweet, I started up a convo with her about her shirt and then got her number that way, haven't gone out with her, not all that interested. 
Another girl just wanted to be a booty call but I'm not looking for any hookups so that was short lived. 
I've also been interested in asking out a coworker but I've heard from others she has a bf, however she's never expressed that to me. So not sure what to do.
All in all I'm definitely gonna keep this mentality up, I've learned you got to be selective with who you ask, you can't just ask every girl you find attractive cause you need more than just physical attraction to keep interest. It's been a great experience and I would love to read how yalls attempts went!
Happy Sunday! "
No Personality At All.,"Do you ever feel that people online dating don’t have a personality at all? I wonder what goes through their mind to pick you but when you want to chat about things and get to know one another, they just don’t respond or just don’t give it their time to actually meet someone or at least get to know that person.

Kinda frustrating that in this day and age we have devices that communicate in a split second."
Don’t assume it’s going somewhere because the first date went well,This has happened to be twice now where the date goes so well I’m like for sure this is gonna go somewhere and then it doesn’t. A person can drop all the hints like saying hey when can I see you next or maybe we can check out this restaurant together one day...but straight up that means JACK SHIT. Don’t fall into the first date trap where it’s going well and all signs point to positive because you never know what goes on in the other persons brain after the date that makes them change your mind. So for everyone who gets upset when contact ends after a first amazing date remember this is just the universe’s way of saying there are people out there for you and I’m showing you that but this just isn’t the one so let me save you some time and end this after one date. Happy dating to everyone don’t get dejected and stay hopeful :)
Stop thinking that is the only person that you would ever click with,"Okay so I saw some posts on this sub about some  people who were getting panicked about not getting much of a response back from someone who seemed really interesting at the first date.

I also read stuff like ""I haven't felt this way with someone else in a long time"" or ""I've never felt so comfortable with someone before and I don't want to lose him"". And I also get to hear the same from some of my friends but I never really talk to them about what's the best thing to do because I tried that a couple of times but they usually start saying to me stuff like ""you don't know me"" or ""no I only want him"" which is annoying.

Therefore I thought why not to write a post about it and tell you all that hey if the person you had a good first date with seems distant to you now and is not really showing much of an interest anymore, drop him. Find another date. Because if he really was the one he would have still been interested into you. It's as simple as that. The person who is meant for you won't do that."

Where do you meet single women after college without looking like an absolute creep?,"Here's what I've (22M) tried so far:

1. Dating apps - duh. My first choice since the woman can just unmatch if she isn't feeling it. I had some matches and conversations, but they didn't go anywhere. The vast majority of girls on there that are around my age are just looking to party or to stroke their ego, or if I match with someone that is genuine, they just don't respond. I've read up about the stats of Tinder matches, and it's just a giant waste of time from a statistical perspective. 
2. Meetup - as in the website/app. Well, the problem is that I live in Silicon Valley, and 99% of the meetup groups (I shit you not, check it out if you don't believe me) are related to AI, big data, machine learning, startups, or VCs. Like for fuck's sake I already spend enough time at work every week, I don't want to spend what little time I have left talking about work. There are a few ""actual"" social groups on there, and they're either for boomers or they're pretty much dead, as in one event per month with two people going. 
3. Gym - I go couple times a week, but it's not a very good place to strike up a conversation. It's crowded, and people all have their workout routines to go through. It simply does not seem appropriate to approach people in that environment. I've also heard from women that they absolutely hate it when guys try to talk to them at gyms, so I'd prefer not to get told ""get lost creep"". 
4. Work - I spend the majority of my waking hours at work. Unfortunately it's a tech startup which means there is more sausage than Oktoberfest. The few women that we do have are significantly older or married/in a relationship. Plus, it's just unprofessional to date a coworker. 
5. Nightlife - I'm not a club person, but I like going to bars. Unfortunately, most of the bars around here are for people in their 30s and 40s. While I could go to SF over the weekends, I haven't been able to get my friends to go with me (it's a long trek considering traffic), and I don't know how women feel about a lone man drinking at a bar. 

I'm also looking into joining a climbing gym because I heard a lot of young people here enjoying it, and it seems like a better place to talk than a gym. I'm open to any advice, but at the end of the day, I can't pretend to be something that I'm not."
"Ghosting is when you send someone a ghost 👻 emoji, right?","So my mom is meeting men using a dating app. Below is what she texted me... Too cute! I think I like this version of ghosting. 🤔🤣

————
Mom: Guess what I found out what GHOSTING is. I’m pretty hip.”

Me: Oh ya? What do you think ghosting is?

Mom: Ghosting is when you send someone a ghost emoji 👻 when you don’t want to talk to them anymore. 

Me: 🤦🏻‍♀️....🤣

—————

At first I thought this was so cute and funny. But this should be a thing...just saying 🤷🏻‍♀️😁"
How do I meet men when I have no social circle?,"This is currently my life: go to work and come home. Before that it was go to school and come home. I have never had a social circle, my two closest friends were online that I no longer talk to. Other than meeting people online, how can a mid 20s girl find some potential partners? I understand that I am not social enough, but very rarely do guys wanna talk to me or even be friends with me in real life. Online I feel like it’s easier to meet people because 1) you’re just typing on a screen 2) you know wherever you are online, there are similar people similar to how this subreddit is. As someone in my mid 20s is it possible 1) to create a social circle or is it too late since most people already have established social circles at this age? 2) is it possible to find potential partners in real life without having to look online in this day and age with online dating so prevalent?"
At what age should you worry if you have never met a woman who was interested in you?,"22M Virgin here. People say you're young so you shouldn't worry about not being on a date. My question is then, when should I worry? When should I recognise there's a problem? Or should I never worry about not meeting a woman who is interested? Many thanks"
This guy is keeping me on the hook until something better comes along and it sucks,"I met this guy on Tinder over the holiday break. We have a lot of common interests and there was a connection straight away, and we have messaged every day since. We had our first date a couple of weeks ago, a week after matching. We talked a lot, we kissed, it felt like I'd finally found my match. But I've noticed over the last week or two his conversation frequency has massively dropped off - it used to be we'd be talking constantly from start to end of the day. He'd check in with me and ask about my day. Now it feels it's a chore for him to talk to me at all.

I've asked him about it and he says he's still interested, he just doesn't have a lot of time to throw my way. But that sounds like bullshit, right? His time now really shouldn't be that different to when we first matched, so why is there a problem now compared to when we first met? I get that conversations die off a little after a while but to not even ask how I'm doing now and then? Ugh.

Also, there's no sign on the horizon of a second date. I've tried suggesting meets but each time he's had to cancel for one reason or another. And every time I try to bring up the what's going on conversation, he says he's still interested and we'll do [insert amazing plans here] next time we go out without ever actually planning said second amazing date.

Aaaaaand now that I've typed all this out, it seems crystal clear I'm in limbo. Anyone know how to self-resuscitate, or gracefully pass on to the other side? Have you ever been in the same situation before? What would you do?

Update: I ended it. A lot of you recommended just taking the high road and walking away, but I felt like I'd just be waiting for him to message me if I just pulled back.

I need ice cream. And shoe shopping."
How to move on?,20M here A year and a half ago I lost the love of my life. She really did complete me. She was my best friend and really cared about me and all I wanted was the best for her. She lost her battle with a heart disorder and died before she could be treated. Ever since I have been lonely and pretty regularly considered just giving up and ending it. I really want to find someone to love because I cant stand being lonely anymore. Any advice?
I hate this era/time of dating and how everything is tied to online.,"I hate this new age of dating everything is connected or linked directly to social media. The idea that even in a bar, club, or populated area full of real people everyone phones are out trying to show off online. I hate online dating and people inability to be honest when not desiring relationship and just want causal sex. Im tired of people first question being do you have an IG, Snapchat, or FB. I’m tired of not connecting with people in real like. I’m tired of filters and plastic surgery, and option being so big that people never want to settle down because they are always look for the next big thing. I’m sick of fake post, and vacation photos people can’t afford. I’m tired of only seeing people through a filter they create. And lastly I’m tired because i feel like I’m alone because i have no social media, and when i try to date traditionally it seems like a lost cause. I don’t want to swipe on tinder any more, or be admired simply because i look beautiful in photos.

I know it sounds stupid but.... I’m just sick of this ear of dating..."
People need to take a step back and look at the reality of things.,"People overthink dating way to much, especially in regards to texting and online dating, often they will subconsciously assume that dating life is like what it is on some tv show or in movies or how they see everyone elses lives. 
That dosent reflect reality. 

A lot of people have insecurities or are insecure because of either how they were treated from past relationships or because of how they were brought up in family dynamics. 
And this can cause major trust issues. 

Unfortunately the way we see the world as kids will often shape how we see it as adults and can lead to unrealistic expectations of ourselves and others. 
Especially in unstable or manipulative family dynamics. 

(edit):  Alot of people do not know what they actually want or need and how to communicate that in a healthy way. 
We go by what we “think” we should have or do in a relationship, not what is actually best for us, because there is so much stigma from society and other people in general. 
Therefore some may find themselves in relationships or situations that they never actually wanted wether they know it or not, making them confused and miserable. 

Every relationship is different and has its own dynamics depending on the people in it. 
You go with what feels right, depending on the situation. 

Just because someone wants to take things slow or dosent text you back frequently dosent mean they are not into you. Or that they disappeared suddenly or left for a while. Things happen in peoples lives. 
And if they do ghost you, then they are not worth your time. 
You move on and try again or work on yourself if you think you have to. 

Often more then not people that take the time to get to know eachother will have better relationships then those who rush into them simply because they feel they have to be in one to be validated or valued as a person. 

People have thier own lives outside of dating and to have a healthy relationship you will need that. 

And everyone has that need to feel loved and cared for, its natural, but just because you are alone dosent mean you are worthless. 
Find something else that makes you happy and someone may come your way."
Why would you avoid meeting the person you have a crush on?,"I am not sure if this is the right subreddit for this question. My brother(28M) has a huge crush on one of my friends(29F). Might be wishful thinking from my end but he gets very smiley when I talk about her, likes almost all of her social media posts and I saw him visibly nervous when they bumped into each other at a party. When I first noticed it, I got very excited because I do think that they have a lot of similar interests and would be very good together. However, every time I suggest that he should meet her or we should invite her over for a movie, he always declines. Last weekend she invited him for a trek (just the two of them) and he said he can't go because he has not been well (he was lying). She recently asked me if he was angry at her for some reason because of this behavior. I know he isn't because he still gets dreamy-eyed every time anyone mentions her name. I am trying to understand this behavior and wondering if anyone else does it too. Is it common? Is it just nervousness? Should I confront my brother about it, we don't really talk a lot about our personal lives.

These two have known each other for over 6 months now and have only met in person twice, but have had multiple text conversations."
"Tried to meet up with a girl, she brings her friends","So one day I (cold)* approached this hot-looking girl and managed to score a meet up with her in a couple of days time for both of us to get to know each other more. She seemed really interested and was setting times and just seemed keen on meeting up with me.

When the day we would meet up arrived, she told me just a couple of minutes before that she would be bringing her friends (she said 5)*. At first, I said ""ok sure"" but deep down I was pretty nervous because the whole thing was unexpected.

When the time came, she brought like a whole crowd (and I mean like 15 or so [in total]*) of friends and I have never felt this uncomfortable in my life. I knew that all of them knew that I was trying to date their friend, and I just wasn't mentally prepared to handle that [the girls were giggling when I tried to talk to the girl I was originally interested in].

Just when I thought I'd handled them well, she brought in another group... and another group... [4 groups of 5, 3, 4 and 3 in them, and yes, SHE BROUGHT 3 DUDES too]* it was like they took turns and waited outside so that they could specifically come in to talk to me [whenever a group would leave, the next group would come in like the wave system you'd see in a video game lmao]*. I ended up being thrust into conversations with new people that I just didn't want anything to do with for the night, life's been busy enough with all the work I have and I just didn't feel like having small talk with loads of strangers who I knew nothing about. 

[While I was trying not to seem too disinterested while talking to one of them about the stuff they did, out of the corner of my eye I noticed that girl just... observing me and smiling in a funny sort of may the whole time and actively tried not to get into the conversation even when I tried to pull her into it]*.

[Sooner or later]*, they all just ended up just hanging out with each other [outside, leaving me alone in the place]*, so I just left when I realized that I'd rather be spending my time finishing my work than entertaining this sh\*t.

[I was told later that was the place they hung out alot after work and the time I met her was exactly when they left it]*.

I felt like I was humiliated by her and the whole group who's probably laughing at me for not being chatty or charismatic or wimping out.

I know that some girls like to test how well their next potential partner will integrate with their friend groups, but I just felt like she forced me into a social situation that I didn't want to be in, and I now fear ever approaching any other girl ever in my life. They will ruin your day.

I hate my life rn

&#x200B;

EDIT#1: Looks like her friends know one of my colleagues from work and I really find it sickening that this story could possibly leak into my work life. I just wanted to meet a girl that was outside my social circle so that even if it didn't work out, things won't go any further than that.

EDIT#2: It wasn't a bar or anything like that  


EDIT#3: This is the first time I've ever posted something on this site and I am genuinely heart-warmed by all the support and reality-checks that you guys brought!

EDIT#4: Okay so I got some rest and wow I never expected this post to blow up. I didn't want to make it too specific because I don't want them to find out I posted this here. 

*I admit that some things were either unclear or exaggerated in anger yesterday and I have corrected them with added clarifications in the brackets."
"Women who are in a relationship with someone who puts in less effort than you, why?","not a rhetorical question. I am actually trying to understand the priorities of such a relationship dynamic.

I have friends who are in LTR or are married to men who visibly put in much less effort than the woman is putting. Small things such as deciding where to go on a date or arranging for activities that will make them spend quality time together are done by the woman. She will plan for days and get him an elaborate gift and he will respond with a 'thanks, babe!'. Like that's it? The catch, however, is that they seem quite happy in this dynamic. It seems as if it is expected of her to be putting in more effort than the guy is putting. Is it? These friends btw also think that I expect too much out of the men I am dating. I am wondering if that is true, or if I am chasing something that is ungettable, or if one person in the relationship will always put in less effort and it has got something to do with personality types. I understand that there are differences in love languages but I still would want the guy to show me his emotions as much as I do to him.

(I am not saying this is true for all relationships, I am just talking about a few of my friends here)."
"If dating doesn't serve you, take a break","So I'll just throw this out here...

I read so many posts from people who are fed up with today's dating culture, OLD, flakey people, getting ghosted, emotionally unavailable people, etc...

And all I can say is...

If dating doesn't serve you...

*Take a break.*

I've played the dating game for almost two years now, since my last LTR ended, and I've had so many bad experiences. I've always chalked it up to meeting the wrong people, bad luck and today's dating culture...

At some point I sincerely felt burnt out. I was depressed and lonely and just couldn't understand why I always had such bad luck in finding someone, anyone, who would just appreciate me...

And then I met up with an acquaintance and we just chatted and I told a story about a night out with a girlfriend of mine.

The story itself isn't relevant but it was one of those evenings where you meet up for ""one drink"" which then turns into a full on party night. And I told him how there are just some people that you can't meet up with for just one drink because it always ends up like that, the two of you just always end up escalating. 

And then it hit me...

It's not them.

It's me.

Those friends you can't just grab one drink with?

*I am also that friend*.

I am the one who let's it get to a point where we order shots at some point although we both agreed we shouldn't.

I am the one who let's it get to a point where we stay out until the morning although we both agreed we should head home before midnight.

And it's the same damn thing with dating.

I attract what I send out into the (dating) world.

I set myself up for failure simply *because I'm trying too hard to find a connection*.

I attract emotionally unavailable people because *deep down inside I am emotionally unavailable myself*.

Because being emotionally available means more than being open to date and have a relationship. It means to be content with yourself and that includes being content *on your own* and having a settled sense of yourself. 

I am just trying too hard to build connections instead of just letting them build up naturally.

And that means I am not available. Someone who's trying that hard can't be truly available, in my opinion. 

Many of us are just so desperately looking for someone to complete us, swiping left and right as if we're choosing an outfit for the night. As if we'd match with just about anyone and get the perfect relationship as long as the other one wants one too.

We're simply setting ourselves up for failure by trying too hard.

And we get depressed because we don't get the results we so desperately crave.

So all I can say is... I am done with dating. But not in a bitter way.

If I happen to meet someone and we just click, I am more than open for that. But I won't be chasing anything or anyone anymore.

I am done trying to make something happen, putting the focus on something outside of myself. I am taking a conscious break from dating. I deinstalled tinder and I won't be glancing around the room anymore when I'm out with friends.

I'll focus on myself again. 

I'll date myself first and foremost. 

Whatever happens happens and whatever doesn't doesn't."
Just had my first kiss(es) at the age of 20,"Last night I went on the first date with my gf since we had recently became official, and towards the end of the night we went to a Walmart,  fucked around for like an hour, and when we got back in the car, it finally happened and I had my first mouth to mouth kiss. Well, technically there was more then just one, and believe me I wish we could’ve just sat in that car and did that the whole night but she’s going out of town tomorrow and had to b up early today so I had to take her hm shortly after. However, I got to kiss her some more before she got out when I dropped her off, so that was good.

Honestly as a 20 year old who had nvr even held a girl’s hand (let alone kiss one) up until this girl I’m with now, it’s all a bit surreal. Nvr could picture myself in a relationship before, just seemed so out of reach for me. But it finally happened, and if it can happen for my romantically hopeless ass, it can happen for anyone who was just as hopeless as me up until not so long ago. Don’t be discouraged, Ik it’s cliche, but it’s true; the right person will come along."
Tinder date did a runner after dinner,"I've been out of the game for about a year now, just enjoying living on my own and not thinking twice about having a partner. However about a month ago I decided out was time to put myself back out there and signed up for Tinder. I got a couple of matches immediately and the chat didn't really go anywhere, but after about a week I got a match which seemed really promising. We talked for a few days via the app before swapping phone numbers, talked about everything and agreed we'd meet up after another couple of weeks. She was incredibly sweet, seemed really genuine and most exciting of all, keen to meet me and see where it goes.

I suggested going for some dinner, just a casual place I know that does really fantastic Italian food. Then we'd go just up the road to a nice pub. She was happy with this and felt comfortable enough to let me pick her up rather than meet me there (I told her to give my name/number/photo to whoever she liked to make her feel more comfortable etc).

I picked her up on time, I had bought her some flowers which she seemed to really appreciate (said that no one had ever bought her some on a date before) and the chat in the car on the way to the restaurant was cool, no awkwardness etc. Dinner was lovely and she said that she would definitely go back there. I paid for dinner and we left to go to the pub for a drink. She wasn't expecting me to pay and said that she would get the drinks as she didn't want to feel like she owed me anything which is fair enough.

We made our way to the pub and parked up somewhere I could potentially leave my car if we decided to stay for more than 1 and we needed to get a cab home. She asked me what I wanted to drink and said she was going to toilet then will go to the bar. She asked me to go and find a table at the other end of the pub (the quieter end). I text her to say where I was sat and she text back immediately saying ok, be there in a minute.

15 minutes later I'm still sat there like a spare prick at a wedding. I got up and walked round the pub to find that she wasn't there anymore. I text her to say ""have you seriously done a runner??"" and she messaged me back after about 5 minutes to say her ex was at the bar and she panicked and left. She had mentioned during the date that her last relationship ended badly and that she has a restraining order against him. It sounded plausible but I still wasn't convinced. Why would she not text or call me to say ""I'm outside, let's go somewhere else"" etc?

I don't think I've ever felt this humiliated. Especially since we talked about our worst ever dates earlier in the night, and to think she couldn't bear to spend a whole one with me! I don't understand how I could have read the evening so differently to her.

This is a major dent in getting back out into the dating world, I feel so deflated."
"Confessed to my friend, she said no, but I'm glad I got it off my chest","I was on edge about my feelings towards my friend. Shes the only girl in our group of friends, so I wasnt sure whether I actually had feelings towards her or if it was just that she was the only girl I knew, but I decided fuck it go for broke. Told her how I felt, she said she wasn't looking to date and anyone and she didn't feel the same towards me, but is fine with still being friends. I will admit I'm a little upset as that isn't the ideal result, but I think its better than just bottling up the feelings. Still have feelings I think, and I don't know if/when they will go away, but I feel better getting it off my chest."
She told me she loved me!,"I've \[19M\] been seeing a girl \[18F\] for around 2 months, and this morning, before we had to go about our day, we were lying there, and she was looking into my eyes, and muttered quietly. I asked her what she said, and she kept smiling and couldn't say it. I knew what she was going to say, we both did, and eventually she said the words! I returned the phrase, and we both smiled at each other.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to write this here to make a note so I can remember this moment <3"
"Hey boys, why do this?","Why say that you like someone, say that you see a future with someone, but never want to just hangout, ask questions, or plan something?

Why even say it if you have no intention of following through? Why keep sending “good morning” texts if you can’t be bothered to keep up the conversation at all?

It’s not as if you’re keeping me on the hook. I’ve already told you I don’t like this and would rather just be friends - yet you persist that you like me and want to build something..

Build what?? Silence??"
Friendly reminder that people come on here for advice,"I've seen a few posts recently where people have been decrying other people's questions as ""cringeworthy"" or ""pathetic"". I've also seen a lot of people hammering the OP in the comments calling them all sorts of names for asking a question.

People come on here to ask very vulnerable and personal questions. This is an anonymous social media site. People come on here asking the questions that feel too stupid to ask family, too personal to ask friends, too blunt to ask potential partners. People come on here saying ""I have no idea what to do here, please help me"". Instead of laughing at the poster or acting as though we're so far ahead of the person asking a question why don't we provide gentle advice instead? Teach them what we know instead of putting them down?

Why am I saying this? I have been in a relationship for two years with a girl I met online. Growing up I wasn't close to my father and really didn't have a male authority figure to go to when it came to dating. It was very much a case of figuring it out as I went along, making mistake after mistake after mistake until finally I didn't. I come on here when I get the chance because I genuinely want to help other people with what I learned, what worked for me so that they can have it perhaps just a little bit easier. I wish I had known about this subreddit when I was dating and could have asked questions here; I also suspect that I would have been called 'cringy', 'desperate', 'clueless', 'moronic' and a litany of other insults that are bandied around by a select few on here. It would have shattered my self-confidence and I might not be in the situation I am in today.

And just to clarify, there is nothing wrong with being direct or straightforward. Sometimes we all need to be told to start thinking clearly and make a decision. All I'm saying is that attacking a poster's character or integrity on an advice forum is neither constructive nor useful.

--------------

On the other side of the coin, this is for those of you asking for advice. We all have baggage we carry and we are all unique individuals. Perhaps you're describing a situation that resembles a particularly negative one I've experienced. I will therefore be more inclined to urge you to stay away, when in reality that may be the worst possible decision. I've seen (an admittedly small amount of) comments and posts on here that have echoes of ""men are garbage"" and ""women ain't shit"" which while I think are perfectly valid opinions that probably have some sort of backstory to them, I urge you not to take as gospel just because someone else believes it. Heck, I even ask that you question what you're reading right now, and if it seems like a bunch of nonsensical drivel then please downvote and move on.

My point is this: people are all different and nobody has the perfect answer to your question. We'll all try to provide advice the best way we can but at the end of the day you've got to combine that with your own intuition and make the decision you feel is best.

Thanks for reading this, all the best in your dating futures!"
"Don't place expectations on who you're interested in. It doesn't let them be themselves around you, and it's selfish to try to mold someone into something they're not to make you happy","Due to how I look, I get the expectation from a lot of women that I get girls all the time and have a lot of experience. I was a fat dork as a kid who got a lucky dice roll genetically and got in shape. I was a late bloomer who is and was afraid of intimacy due to being molested as a kid. Much better with it now than I used to be, but it's still a hurdle I deal with. When you project onto me that I have to be some Casanova, I can't feel comfortable around you. By extension, I withdraw and act disengaged, throwing girls off all the time, and ultimately not going anywhere with most of them. When I can sense that you're projecting some obnoxious fantasy of who I am onto me, I lose interest because I don't live to satisfy your ideation of me, and I don't need to feel like crap because I couldn't live up to your mental image of who I'm supposed to be. I give the same courtesy to girls I date, and let them inform me about who they are as opposed to assuming anything. 

It's so annoying when people project who they want you to be onto them. It makes you feel like your actual self isn't good enough, and that's not fair."
"At what point in dating does the moment strike a guy that makes them think ""I want her to be my GF""?",Really interested in the male perspective here. What goes on in your head when you decide that you want to go from just dating to a full-blown relationship? Do you have Pinnacle moments with her that make you realize or is it just like a switch that gets flipped?
[24M] Is it normal if I get a boner whenever talk to my crush about love or related topics or touch her near neck?,"It is the very beginning of my first ""Real"" relationship and it is sometimes becoming too much for my wrench to stay calm. Whenever I talk to her about topics such as love, being a relationship, why we like each other or like consoling her or hugging her, I start getting a boner and it is, you know, nearly impossible to control it. I mean I HAVEN'T so far, ever thought about having sex with her because I want to be very sure. Yet, even without getting those feelings, I get the boner. Is it normal?"
Slow Yo' Motha F****** Roll!!!,"Seriously. I read many posts on here which can be more or less summed up as.

""I met this <potential partner> on <dating app> and we really hit it off and had an amazing connection. We hung out <3x-7x per week> for <less than 1 month> and had a lot of sex. Then when I caught feelings and pushed for a relationship they <ghosted/told me no/friendzone/FWB'd me.> I'm really hurt what do I  do?

Let me tell you what you can do:

#SLOW YOUR MOTHER FUCKING ROLL!!!

Seriously. Stop getting crazy attached to people you *literally barely know* and meet on dating apps. If you want a relationship, a real relationship and are tired of getting used for sex/your time stop jumping headfirst into them with strangers. Like that's a recipe for failure.


I'm not saying be a nun. I'm not saying that you need to wait a million dates to fuck someone.

I am saying **temper your expectations**. Seriously. I get that in the modern world, instant gratification is the thing. In the world of relationships, it is decidedly NOT a thing for most people. Having sex with a stranger 5x a week for a month and expecting a long term relationship out of it is setting yourself up for failure. You might have some success, but you'll have less than failures.

If you want some real shit with a compatible person, be patient. Stop rushing into things, step back and observe whether this sexy stranger is someone who you appreciate and vice versa. 

Be less like a puppy dog and more like a cat in your approach to strange potential partners.

Good luck."
I’m bi. A trend I’ve seen is that women seem to see me as good end game material (but not yet) but don’t want to hookup with me. Whenever this coronavirus thing is over with I think I’ll just focus on bettering myself and maybe hookup with men from time to time,I’m just tired of being treated like an awesome guy that is totally wanted but when it comes down to it is kinda not. Not yet. I’ll still be friends with several women. We’ll still be cool. But I need to get over looking for a relationship. I’m about to be making a bunch of money and I’m sorry but if that’s how it plays out I’ll feel like I’m being used. I’m not gonna let myself get treated like that. I’m not gonna let that happen
"I’m a member of the US Army, let me help you protect yourself against relationship fraud.","Background: I am U.S. Army infantry soldier with four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. I was lucky enough to see some cool stuff in my life. We always had a camera on hand or some combat photographer who traveled with us. I collected hundreds of photos during my travels.

I become a recruiter temporarily for the Army. This is known as a Department of the Army Selected Recruiter (aka DA Select Recruiter). It’s a 3 year commitment and then you go back to your job. Part of being a recruiter is having a social media presence. A professional Facebook page or something like that you can post your recruiting stuff to and photos of your “Army story”. I had hundreds of photos of on my FB page. I’m now back at my normal job and no longer a recruiter so I deleted my social media page.

I first found out my pictures where being used for scamming a few years ago. A nice older lady contacted me (50’s). She has had a relationship with a fake me for sometime. She couldn’t believe I was actually a real person. The fake me was in Iraq and then recently moved to Africa to fight terrorist. The fake me needed money after a few months because I was almost out of food because the “bad guys” destroyed it and I was running low on bullets. Thank god she was smart enough to look further into my pictures and found the real me. I looked up my name and 11 fake accounts popped up in Facebook. The name was usually slightly misspelled or maybe Rank was different or first name was different. Some where easy to delete and others not so easy and Facebook refused to delete them for sometime. Even having friends and family report them did no good.

It end up getting to the point I would have to search my own images and variations of my name monthly. I’d have those accounts deleted and wait another 30 days to do it all over again. The scammers then moved to other social media platforms. Dating websites/apps, Instagram, and so on. To many for me to look into so I just waited until another women would contact me letting me know she has been dating the fake me for sometime on whatever app. My pictures are all over the Internet now and used regularly. I have even seen a fake Department of Defense Military ID used to make the scam more believable. I’ll add a link to it later once I find a good place to host since r/dating doesn’t allow pictures.

So now I’m here to maybe answer some questions and give you advice on how to be safe from the fake me. 

1) Every service member has a base. Normally those bases are local known as CONUS (continent of the US) and a few have some OCONUS (outside the continental US). CONUS would be like Fort Benning GA, Fort Drum NY as examples. OCONUS would be like Germany, Italy, Kuwait, Alaska, Hawaii are common ones. Other services would be similar just different locations. This leads to #2

2) Regardless of service NO ONE is stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan or any combat zone permanently for multiple years. Deployments usually last 1 year or less depending on service before they go home to their main base mentioned in #1. Navy do like a 6 month deployment on ships, Army rate now is 9 months to a year, Air Force maybe 3-6 months and so on. It all depends on their mission, but no one is deployed for multiple years to a combat zone, not even the super super secret Special Forces guys. CIA May be different but those guys wouldn’t tell you they are CIA or even have pictures on the Internet. If your in the other branches feel free to add in your deployment length. 

3) We don’t need anything. The military takes care of us well. They will never leave us high and dry starving in a foreign country. If a “service member” asks you for money its automatically fake. If he is real and stateside and asking for money he is a looser.  You should stop contact them immediately because he isn’t someone you want in you life.

4) Fake ID, I recently have received a fake ID card of me. It’s laughably bad but to an untrained eye it may look very real. No person in the military will send their CAC Card (Military or Department of Defense ID) to a strange lady. If they do then once again they are an idiot and not someone you would want to associate with.

5) People in the military while not deployed have normal lives. I goto concerts, shop for groceries, wash my car, wear civilian clothes. I don’t live Army 24/7 and wear my combat uniform or dress uniform every waking moment unless deployed. If he shows up on a Saturday night wearing a dress uniform for a date he’s a fake. Our work hours are normally 6am to 5pm on average. There might be some slight differences in time depending on duty but that’s a normal service member schedule. A Military Police Officer or someone working as a nurse might have odd hours but your average person has a pretty set schedule unless something “special” is going on. Only time besides deployment someone might wear their uniform 24/7 will be if they just entered the military and are going through boot camp, basic training or a military training school, those are only temporary though.

6) Other service members can’t look up anyone else record. Don’t call your local recruiting station and ask is this person real. There is no database we have access to that will give us that information. Only thing you can do is if something seems wrong have a friend who is a vet or service member tag along on your date and shoot the shit with him (valor check). It’s kinda bad taste but better safe then sorry. OR you can do it yourself by asking for their military email. It’s not top secret to give it out. For the Army it usually looks something like First.MI.Last.mil@mail.mil. Notice the .mil at the end and not gmail.com? If I was wanting to be a douch and use my military status for the ladies why would I care if someone sent me an email to my easily accessed military email account? I’d be like sure.

Please vote this to the top and spread the word and maybe save a friend from heart ache or financial ruin. I know my grammar sucks and I probably have some serious typos. This is what late night reddit posting on a phone looks like.

Now for AMA.





"
How many of you guys actually like black women?,"Dating sucks as a black woman because most people don't prefer black woman unless it is sex related with no strings attached. We are viewed as ugly, too dark, our hair is quote on quote too nappy and ugly and we are mostly seen as ratchet. I cant get attention from men unless it is writing or sex related. I hate my life, i'm tired of being single....."
Dating fuckin sucks,"So I’ve been dumped recently by this guy that rocked my world for a month straight. This is the first time I felt this way in a long time. The dates he took me on were magic from nice dinners to dancing under the stars by the lake. Fed me a line that he wouldn’t have unprotected sex until he said he “I love you”, then one night before fully entering me he says I love you and I received him bare. I haven’t done that in forever but he made me so comfortable. Things were great until he decide he couldn’t continue in fears of hurting me which in turns would hurt him. Finally I did an extremely lame attempt to chase after him by showing up at his apartment but he would even out and told to go home. Like literally just stopped everything! I’ve struggled with this for two weeks thinking I did something, which he says I haven’t, but it just doesn’t make sense. I can’t stop think about him though I try. I keep thinking he’ll back come or reach out to me but I doubt he will. Idk just sucks and I’m not sure what I hoped to achieve by posting this but yea."
A girl gave me her number and I don't know what to text her,"So I (M21) met this girl who works at the school library and we would always have some small talk about how we are doing and how classes are going, you know the normal college stuff. Then she suddenly asked me if I have an Instagram, to which I replied no but I asked if we could just exchange numbers. She then gives me her number and I am surprised and now I don't know what to send as the first text. What do you guys think???"
How is it possible to even get a girlfriend?,"I just don't get it really, online dating is obviously useless in that regard, but even in really life, lets say I start talking a girl. Even if it goes well and I got her number, the next day she has more than likely forgotten about the interaction and I don't why a girl would have enough reason to meet up somewhere again because of a 10 minute conversation she had with a stranger. Like why would a girl meet up with someone again because of some small talk; does that even happen? 

The only other circumstance I can figure working out is if you see a girl often enough and talk enough that you can maybe get a chance, but once you are not in college, apart from maybe the workplace, I don't think too many situations like that exist.

&#x200B;

I dunno, I just don't see how it is achievable to set up, and impress a girl enough to even go on a date. How does this work?"
"Guys of reddit, how does your behavior change when a girl becomes girlfriend material as oppose to just dating?","Basically I am wondering how you act when a girl becomes girlfriend material. 

I've been dating this guy and I am thinking it is going really really well. I think he is boyfriend material, but am wondering if he could start feeling the same?

We've gone out 5 times. He waited until the third date to ask me back to his, so I am thinking he is looking for something more stable than just a hook-up. He wanted to see me for a fourth date knowing it would be an early night with no possibility of sex due to schedules, which I also think is a good thing. 

He told me that he showed his friends my pictures and said they are all very curious to meet me. He did try to invite me to his friend's bbq but I was working... From what I am told guys typically don't bring you around their friends unless they are thinking about something long term. 

He will be away to visit home for a few weeks but made sure to see me the night before leaving. He said things like to make sure I don't forget him while he is away, and that he wasn't excited to go home anymore since he would be leaving me. He even made it a point to text me during his layover. 

I am overthinking this, and will of course just see how things play out. But I can't help but wonder if he maybe feels the same?"
A personal guide to how I went from being friendzoned and constantly rejected to not having a problem meeting women and going on dates.,"Well after I loss 90 pounds I learned some things that helps with meeting new women:


•Find a hobby that you enjoy. 
 
 -it gives you something to talk about
 
 -women love hearing about your passions

  -it gives you confidence in SOMETHING. Since I didn’t have confidence, I try to find the good attributes about myself and it eventually builds up to solid, unconscious confidence.


•have some good wingmen
  
-if your friends have a hard time getting girls, y’all will just look like a group of weirdos. They don’t have to be your closest friends, but be around interesting and funny people. A group of women can often hang out with a group of guys and then they try to pick which on they want so make yourself stand out. 
 
-it’s easier to start a conversation with at least one other person with you. Girls go out in groups, you should too.


• just talk to her
 
 -I personally go up and ask how they are doing and ask if I can stay and chat. If there are things like beer pong or pool, invite her to “get her ass beat” she’ll wanna be competitive.

  -BE FUNNY. I had no confidence in my looks so my humor was an attribute I focused on. Once you get her laughing, don’t stop. I promise if you see an ugly guy with a hot girl who isn’t rich, it’s guaranteed that he is hilarious.
  
-ask her if she’s from the area or visiting. It’s always a good start up question. (Helps if you are traveling because you get to talk about traveling)

  -honestly, asking how her day is going works too. Even if she says “good” “fine” “okay” you can follow up with how your day is going in detail. If she engages, she’s interested, if she doesn’t, she probably isn’t.
 
 -EYE CONTACT EYE CONTACT EYE CONTACT. Chin up, shoulders back, hands visible. Look at her like you have interest in her. As my friend put it, look at her like you want to fuck the shit out of her (not in a creepy way) (alluring, seductive eye contact that says hey I like you) Essentially you want to completely give off the vibe that you are talking to her with interest and not just some stranger who wants to have a little chat.


•Good hygiene.
  
-there is no “bad hygiene day”. At least not to the girl you are trying to talk to. First impressions are everything. 


•it’s like door to door sales
 
 -it’s a numbers game
  
- door to door sales taught me how to hear “no”. No big deal, just knock on the next door. If you have a good approach, it WILL work, but like sales, everyone doesn’t want your product. Rejection is okay.
 
 -use what works for you and learn from your mistakes. If you think “shit I shouldn’t have said that” or “shit I should have said that” then just try it next time.


•Have at least one female friend 
  
-remember that girl who friendzoned you? Tell her you want to get out and date but you want to fix your approach. I was in the friendzone, but she was still a great friend. She told me she had a single friend but I better not ruin it by talking about politics. I laughed and she didn’t. She told me that nobody wants to hear about politics and religion all the time (or any controversial issues) and it scares people away. I didn’t even notice it until she told me and now that I look back a few years, I wouldn’t want me either. There might be something you unconsciously do that scares people off. Now I know what NOT to talk about and my success rate went up.
  
- she can put you with friends. If your lady best friend goes out a lot, she meets new girls all the time. One thing we all know is that cute girls have cute friends. It also gives you and the new girl a conversation starter. Say your friends name is Jane, the conversation could start about how funny it is that Jane set you two up and now y’all can talk about memories with Jane to break the ice.
 
 -she will make you the best tinder profile. I know a guy who’s attractive but had no luck on tinder. He gave his lady friend his phone and he got 12 matches daily. Girls know what girls like.


•good places to go
 
 -yoga. I personally enjoy yoga for myself but there are always women in there. It tends to be more successful when you establish that you are in the class for self improvement and not for eye candy. It actually makes you more interesting since most guys are too “masculine” for yoga. Don’t be surprised if you get approached. One thing going to yoga does is it gets you comfortable talking to women. They might be curious to know what a confident, comfortable, non creepy, single guy is doing there and they will ask. Just do you and enjoy yourself.
  
-meditation classes, like yoga this is another place where women (especially college aged) go for self practice. You might bump into someone who does yoga and boom, you have something in common. Ask her where she goes and if you are super lucky, she might go to the same place as you! Now you have a familiar face at the meditation place and yoga place. Also, young adult meditation classes typically have things like picnic days, bar nights, and other social events. Social events are meant for you to be social after all, this is your chance. Even if you only become friends with these women, you can use that to meet more women. They might have single friends and so and so forth.
  
-a bar. I try to go in a group of no more than 4 men so it’s not intimidating. Bonus points if you have 2 or 3 girls with you. It’s easy for a group of people to strike up a conversation with another group of people. Even if you go alone, everyone is drunk and doesn’t have their walls up so talking comes easy. Always smile when you approach.
 
 -the club. Essentially the same thing with a bar. On the dance floor, go up to her laughing and smiling and ask to dance. Look fun and be fun. If you are turning up with your boys and you feel a butt brushing up against you from behind, it’s a good chance she wants to dance. I was dangerously in the friendzone with everyone I tried with about 2 years ago and now I normally dance with 20 to 30 girls in the club. I typically don’t try to get numbers just because I genuinely go to dance, but I’ve had a few offer their number. My first time st the club, i talked to some girls and convinced them to come to the dance floor but I didn’t know how to dance so we ended up standing around until one of them literally grabbed my and started dancing. After they left, I looked at the guys who were getting all the girls and then looked at the ones standing around with their arms crossed. As a guy you can see the lack of confidence in them to go dance and if you can see it, women DEFINITELY see it. so I decided to do the exact thing that the successful guys were doing and after a few visits to the club, I became comfortable with my approach. I may sound like a hoe but I promise on a night where I danced with 20-30 girls, I got rejected by another 15-20. I personally don’t consider myself attractive, but confidence goes miles.
  
- the military. Being in the military helps a lot when you go to pick up girls because if you can’t think of anything to say, you can at least bring up being in service. And I don’t mean go out to boast and brag, I mean it’s a good response to if you’ve established that you aren’t from the area and she asks “what brings you to the area”. Realistically, there are a lot of women who love military men. Because of that, you need to be CAREFUL when looking for something long term. If I go out for a good time, I can mention military (tho I typically don’t) but if I’m looking for a relationship, I tend to save that until after I know she wants me for who I am so I don’t risk getting with someone after my benefits. If you’re in the navy, you get to travel everywhere and all sorts of crazy ass stories to talk about so you get comfortable talking to women pretty quickly. Not to mention that boot camp gives you confidence boost because you eat, sleep, breathe, shit, and shower with 100 alpha males for 2 months straight. You come out being EXTREMELY confident and sometimes borderline cocky. 


Go to the gym fellas. If you feel like you are too skinny, eat right and work out. If you feel like you are too fat, eat right and workout. I put on 20 pounds of beer belly but I can still get around. Try your best to maintain your top shape. You will be happy with the body you worked for! Women love a man of action and commitment and going to the gym is a great way to establish it. The best time to go is whenever you REALLY don’t want to go. I’m not some jock hotshot who has girls drooling over him. I still have insecurities. I still get nervous talking to really cute girls. I still have down times. But all of this has helped me improve greatly and at least got me to the point where I feel like I can go out and find a partner in the a week. I prefer to stay single and enjoy that while I’m the military. All of this is based off of my personal experience so I can’t really speak for anyone else. I’ve helped a few guys get out of the friendzone and into the dating scene with this advice and I hope I can help some other men across reddit. Please let me know if this works for you or not. My PMs are open for anyone with more specific questions.
 
Just remember this, even the hottest guys on the planet hear no. Rejection is okay guys.

Edit: fixed up the paragraphs for an easier read"
I got rejected and it felt great!,"So, I was at the mall. I went to this beard salon for dudes. There was a cute girl behind the counter. I ask her some questions about products I've been thinking about. She was cute, funny, and a little sarcastic. So I asked, mid convo, without a lead in, and with another customer within earshot, ""hey you want to grab some coffee some time?"". She said She'd love to, but her boyfriend probably wouldn't like it. I said it was no biggie and to take care. Then she said, ""but thank you, though, I'm  honestly very flattered."" Her face even got a little red. I left feeling very good, and apparently it made her day too. Moral of the story: Even a ""no"" can make you feel really good, and being asked out may make her feel good. If you don't ask the only thing you'll leave with is regret."
Dating For People Over 25+,"I miss having substantial feelings for someone, instead of thinking ""this person is good for me, I should see where it takes me,"" before I date them. I know that sounds bad, but I feel like I haven't had a ""fuck yes I want to date you"" situation in a long time.

Is it just me, but I miss the feeling of having a crush on someone and it feels like it's been forever since I've felt that. I'm 27 and before all this Covid stuff, my group of friends would always go out with each other to clubs/bars, but we would never meet anyone new. I know that it's one of the issues, but are other late 20's experiencing this?

When I bring this up to people, they always say ""you gotta find someone on a dating app,"" but I really don't want to meet my SO on one of these apps. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with that and I have many friends who have met wonderful people from dating apps. I just want that ""crush"" feeling before I get into something serious and I feel that apps don't do that for me? I am on all of the apps, but I just feel like it's so superficial!

Does anyone else feel like this? I know that Covid is making things WAY worse...I'm just worried because I'm catching myself saying ""They would be good for me, maybe I should try it out,"" instead of saying ""I have a crush on this person and I want to see if they have mutual feelings.""

Maybe it's me just missing stupid teenage romance, but I used to feel this way with my past relationships."
I deleted all the dating apps,"I have been going back and forth for years reinstalling tinder, deleting it redowloading mostly I think because I would start to get lonely but then I realized, I need to be with myself before I can attempt to find someone by flipping through like a magazine. It sucks that we have come to this type or dating; sitting in our rooms flipping through based on looks and a brief description. Also, I wouldn't mind going to bars or places like that but i also don't want a one night stand. What can we do as the youth to change this? Create another community? Any thoughts?"
Some positive changes in online dating?,"I wonder if everyone is becoming exhausted with the culture of online dating because after weeks of matches behaving badly (ghosting, nice-guying, one word responses), I got a string of absolutely wonderful guys. None of them worked out but I wanted to shout out the good guys that DO exist on dating apps.

One sent a message explaining why he matched with me (attractive), why he never messaged (only in town for the weekend), and why he was unmatching (lives on other side of country and doesn't want to waste my time, distance on app verified this). 

After chatting with a second guy, he told me something I said was a dealbreaker to him and he was going to unmatch me BUT that I was pretty and wished for me to find a good guy. ""I know dating is rough, but there's someone out there for you"".

After a date, for the FIRST TIME EVER a guy texted me to explain why we wouldn't work, saying that he wanted kids really soon, but wished me the best of luck. Usually I just get ghosted.

Maybe it's a fluke, but seeing good, sincere, and mature people on these apps give me hope."
"Finally, A Good Date!","Met up for drinks at a local pub tonight, and spent about 3 hours talking, joking around, and getting to know each other. Instant energy/chemistry through the nervousness on my side of things (first date I've been on in a few months), and he even cuddled me when I got cold from the AC and we had a quick kiss goodbye with plans to meet up again as we parted ways. Texted each other again as soon as we both got to our homes to make sure we got back safe too.

I know it doesn't sound like much, but this was the best date I've had since my divorce from my long-time partner over a year ago, and it feels great to have a glimmer of hope for romance and possibly even love again after so long.

UPDATE:

Same guy and I have been texting a bunch every day since our first date, and today we had our second date, and I'm happy to report this one was just as awesome as the first! 

It was an impromptu coffee date this time after we both got off work. Then we had a quick grocery shopping trip together, which was way more fun than it sounds, we were goofing around, holding hands, and generally just being silly and cuddly the whole time, plus I got my shopping for the week done before picking up my son too (I'm a single Mom with full physical custody, so grabbing opportunities for a love life/dating whenever I can in between parenting responsibilities and my career is a necessary talent lol). We're seeing each other again next weekend for a lunch date, and there's definitely ongoing sparks and chemistry with no red flags so far, so this might actually be going somewhere. Over the moon here, guys, no matter what :D"
How do you “play it cool” when you’re extremely lonely and someone you like is interested in you?,"I tend to come off as desperate when I meet someone I like. I try to hang out with them as soon as possible. I tell them they’re beautiful and shower them with compliments. I text too much. 

I keep driving women away but I don’t know how to stop myself."
I ain't afraid of no ghost...,"Long story short: Met this girl at a gig I played two and a half months ago. Asked her out, we go out on quite a few dates, we bang, we meet families and continue dating once a week until this past Sunday. I ask her to hang again...radio silence. Can someone explain this to me? Legit, I spend all this time getting know someone and this is how they choose to end things...I'm shook...I'm spooked."
look at all these dudes,"I'm a bartender.  I remember one night, there were these two ladies at my bar, one of them was married and taking her newly single friend out for cocktails/commiseration what have you.  I overhead this, at one point:  the two of them were looking at some dating app and the single lady just said, kind of in an exasperated way, ""look at all these dudes.""  That always stuck with me for whatever reason, just a wall of dudes vying for attention.  

&#x200B;

Now that I'm single I can't shake that feeling every time I open up one of those apps.  I'm just another rando in a wall of dudes.  Smiling for the camera, holding a football or a basketball, posing while rock climbing or near a fucking canoe.  Just a wall of dudes, hoping and completely clueless that someone picks you up and somehow that answer is found.  If one falls out, another is there a second later to fill right in that place.  "
"Ladies, what are top 5 things that guys have done to secure your interest in him for a second date?","I’m going to assume that if you’re willing to go on a first date that most likely you’re at least SOMEWHAT interested in him.

What were some top 3-5 things that a guy can do or have done that made you like him even more or secured your initial interest in him?"
I’m sad,"I (24M) matched with a cute girl (21F) on Tinder, and it seemed like it was going great. We added each other on Snapchat, and we were talking for a week. I just saw she unfollowed me on Snap. My guess is she just lost interest, or I asked if she was free to meet one too many times. Anyways, there’s nothing really to do. Just wanted to tell someone I’m upset."
How is it so easy for everyone else.,"Why is dating absolutely impossible for me but a breeze for everyone else? I have a friend who was just single for about two weeks and has already found a new boyfriend, meanwhile I've been split with my ex for 10 months and I can't even get one date in that time period? Not for a lack of trying either, I've been on all these dating apps, I get matches, I get likes, but nobody *ever* asks to go out with me or even hook up. It fucks with my confidence big time.

Also, it seems like when you're 21, everybody is taken. Literally 80% of my college must be in a full out committed relationship, I feel so alone in being single and I fucking hate it. I hate when people say to focus on yourself and love yourself, that only delays the inevitable, this is a culture that teaches us that it's bad if you're single. People look at you funny when you tell them you're single. Dating feels like a race that I ended up last in, an auction that I showed up broke to.


Edit: I'm a dude!! The friend I mentioned is a female"
A Women's Guide to Dating," 

TL;DR - Get off of online dating, be confident and approach/show interest, be active/interesting, realize your standards.

Hello Everybody!

I've seen far too many posts on here from women complaining about how hard it is to find guys. Dating is hard for both genders, but unless you're 35+ you should have no issue finding dates. Here is a guide on how to do so.

1. Don't be overweight. I'm sorry, but that's the way the world works. Overweight guys get the same shit overweight gals do. Sure there are some lump cuddlers out there, but they're a rariety. Looks are half the battle. Humanity is superficial. We know, get over it.
2. Turn off online dating. Online dating for guys is utter...shit. Okcupid did a study and 80% of the women went after the same 20% of men. Let that sink in. So many guys just don't give a shit about online dating, even if they're on it. Why? Cause if they didn't their egos/self esteem would be shit (and for a lot of them it is). So they don't take it seriously or anything that happens on there seriously. I've also found that online dating may lead to a ""burden of choice"". Some women I know would go on 2-3 dates a week (each with a different guy from bumble) and complain about not finding someone. Everytime she'd have the slightest inclination that something is better on the next swipe, she'd drop her current person.
3. Go outside. Literally, go out and do anything that doesn't include yoga, cafe, and eating. Here are some things I've observed. All of these I've seen typical bros, nerdy engineers, pot smokers, practically every flavor of guys.  

   1. Coed sports. I live in a major city and everytime I join a team, it is usually 4 gals per 10 guys.
   2. Meetups. I've been to all sorts of meetups. Ranging from fitness ones, to bonfires, to drinking, art, and everything in between. The ratio here is even worse than Coed sports. I went to a ""singles"" night. 20 women, 70 guys. Yeap. There are Meetup group owners who create fake accounts of attractive women to get guys to show up.
   3. Cooking classes. Not counting couples. Most of the time it is a 3-1 male to female ratio.
   4. Festivals. Esepcially anything related to beer (brewing for example). Metric ton of guys walking around
   5. Live shows. Especially anything that isn't hard core electronic. While I hate labels, think ""hipster"". Live music with an actual band. The underground/dive bars that aren't destination bars are great for this too. Just be sure it is in a ""young"" area.
4. Approach. Get this bullshit execuse of ""if he doesn't have the balls to approach"". No, don't give me that shit. You're using that to put up a mental defense to execuse not taking chances. To execuse not making yourself vulnerable. Learn how to show interest. You don't have to approach, sure. If you do it, you'll get a ton of dates and meet a lot of great guys. But if you don't want to go that far, learn to show interest. Look at a guy. Seriously just stare at him. Then when he looks at you smile for a few seconds, then look away. Boom, there's the secret sauce. The chances of that guy approaching you just went up tenfold. If you're sitting there eating looking away, reading a book, or literally doing anything other than staring at the guy...90% of the guys wont approach. Guys are conditioned from an early age that approaching is bad/rude. No idea why and each guy usually develops this differently. But most of them are to scared of coming off creepy, rude, or bothersome. Not only that, but guys notice other guys approaching and striking out in bars/public places. It just takes once or twice of seeing a gal get angry at a guy for approaching for them to get turned off from attempting it themselves. Some guys I know approach constantly at night. A lot of them constantly strike out. Usually its because guys approaching in public is tough. What do you expect them to talk about? How you and him both like drinking beer? Hard to build a raport off of that.
5. Be interesting. Don't give me this busy bullshit. Everyone is busy. You're going to be busy for the rest of your life. Don't use that as an execuse to not be interesting. If I ask you about you and your answer is ""Religion/God, Coffee/Food, Yoga, Beach, Drinking, Dancing, Travel, and Work"" (or worse less than that), you're as basic as they come. Goes for guys too, but if you want to get the great guys don't be basic. That simple. Find something that is interesting to talk about. Volunteer, be passionate about something.
6. Learn to have a conversation. Some of my girl friends suck as conversations. Guys approach them in public and its like they're interviewing her. Then they ask me why it didn't work out. Ask questions about, show emotion, show interest. Not doing this gives off this vibe that you're expecting HIM to impress you. Don't do that, they pick up on it fast. Chemistry goes both ways. Don't expect it to just happen, it needs a catalyst.
7. Realize your standards. Some women I know are cool people, but by god do they shoot high. They may be a 5/10 in the looks and personality department, but they'll only give the time of day to guys who are walking models with super successful careers and other great shit. Hey, if you can snag someone like that and they don't have a shit personality...do it girl. But don't lock yourself down to 10/10s.

I hate to plug, but seriously look at Matthew Hussey on youtube. Most of his free videos bring up points about dating (especially when it comes to getting guys) that is 100% true. There is a lot of solid advice on there."
I thought he was the one.,"I met him a few weeks ago on a dating app. 
We chatted, conversation was going so great. 
I tried to manage my expectations, because we all know face-to-face interaction holds the real weight. 

First date, it was unreal. 
I've never ever felt like this before.
I've never felt so comfortable with an internet stranger, so connected on so many different levels. 
Conversation flowed like a dream. 
I smiled so much my face hurt. 

I've never actually been in a relationship before, so if you'd just ask me what I wanted in a partner, I could only give you a vague description with no concrete details. 
But this man, I thought *he's exactly what I wanted*. 

We talked, joked around, held hands and hugged. 
Pretty sure that's no big deal for most, but for me I've never felt so comfortable with someone on the first date. I am a very guarded person, but with this man, I let down my walls *just like that*.

He told me he'd always felt the need to rush home on his first dates.
But he told me, the worst part of our date was that it had to end. 
And I told him I was so scared, because I've never felt like this before. I felt so afraid that this wasn't real. 
And he told me not to overthink, to just follow my heart.
And for the first time in a long while, I let myself believe his words. 
I really, really believed that he's going to be someone special in my life. 

But fast forward 2 weeks, plus after another date that went well, he stopped putting in the same effort. 
He used to text me once or twice daily, but conversation died down, and he didn't try to continue it. 
I told him to let me know when he's available for our next meeting.
He said okay. 
And then he didn't reach out for a few days. 
Then I suggested a date, he told me he had something on. 
And then nothing, no alternative date, no explanation that he's busy. 
Then I suggested another date, *nothing again*. 

By this point, my heart sank. 
All I wanted was some kind of indication that he wanted to make the effort. 
But there's none. 

*So I let him go.* 
It was the hardest decision I've made in a while.
I told him that thank you, I had fun but maybe we're not really right for each other. 
This time, he actually replied, saying that he's just tired. 
But he agreed to my statement that we're not really right for each other.

If he had just said that he wanted to give us another try, I would have caved in. 
All I wanted was less than a minute of his time to just simply tell me that he's busy, and will get back to me later.
*But he didn't even do that.*
I wasn't even worth a minute of his precious time.

I know deep down I deserve someone who's willing to put the same effort as me into making a relationship work, but I still can't help but think *maybe I was wrong, maybe I should have just waited*. 

And I'm just trying to get all this out so I can feel better.
It hurts so damn much. 
*Because he made me feel things I've never felt before.
Because he made me believe in love again.* 

But alas, I guess *we're just not really right for each other.*

Or maybe I might regret this forever.

Edit: 
Thank you for all the responses, guys. I accept all of them even though some may think I'm coming across as needy/clingy. That might be true. And I agree I should work on myself too.

Also, I'm from a relatively conservative country so I don't think kissing on the first date is all that common. I have been on a couple of dates and none I felt as comfortable. 

Another thing was that he did mention that he's been ghosting pretty much every girl before me after the first date, and never really got to the 2nd date. Is that a red flag? I'm not sure but it did make me think that perhaps he's just waiting to do the same to me."
"I can't prove it, but I think dating apps group less attractive people together when swiping.","I realize this is entirely an opinion because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But at least for me, when I am swiping, eventually I'll get to a point where I literally swipe left through 50+ people in a row that I would classify as unattractive. 

When this happens, I actually start to say ""when am I going to see someone attractive, what the hell?"" Literally one after another. It must be how their algorithms group people. There is certainly not a ""mix"" of attractive and ugly people when I get to these groups. 

Does anyone know if this is actually the case? Thanks."
Remember; if they don’t make effort when you do...,"Don’t give it back regardless of how much you like them in this first phase.

Some people will lead you on & waste your time.

Some people will drag you along without calling it quits then act like nothing happened. Don’t date these people.

Effort is the most attractive trait everyone should have by default. making effort shows to a person that you matter & you respect them even if you’re calling it quits, saying it is STILL effort.

Make sure you make effort in your dates.
Make sure they reciprocate it back.

If they don’t? They are NOT the one for you."
Stop Stigmatizing Virginity,"Some of us are virgins in our 20s or older not because we are religious, prudes, asexual or crazy but maybe just maybe we would like to do it with someone who respects and cares for us as people and not objects for their sexual pleasure.

Edit: I'm a virgin for several reasons. One i cannot be aroused by someone I have no emotional intimacy with. I rather sleep with a old friend of mine, even with the bad history we had, then a man I know knows nothing about me and will never be interested in how I feel what I have to say.

2. 99.9 of men who approached me wanted to sleep with me without even knowing my name while claiming to want a relationship. But their insistence on sexualizimg the conversation and going to their house so early in dating revealed their true intentions.

3. I am a introvert and I had very few if any friends throughout my life until fairly recently when I joined a commune. Even then my social network is pretty small and that translates to less opportunities to meet men thay may share my interests in real life. So I have to go through the trash on online apps in hopes of finding that one gem of a guy out of 100s that is interesting, interested in me and respects my boundaries and is not interested in hooking up. It's very hard to find.

Edit 2: I am so happy at how many people resonated with this. Its great to be reminded you are not alone and a freak of nature, even when the society around you treats you like one for being a virgin. I never expected the amount of responses and support I got from people lol. Also, positive note I met a guy today and he was very chill, respectful. Maybe because he is Eritrean ? I got no idea lol but it was a good 4 hour walk and talk."
So today I decided to ask a girl out for coffee the first time,"She said that she didn't know what my plans were but that she already has a boyfriend. Also that she's still probably down for coffee. I declined because I didn't want to interfere with any of that. I'm glad it wasn't bad.. Though I struggled to get the words out which was probably hilarious. And apocalyptically cringe worthy. 

All in all, 9.9/10 would recommend just taking the plunge. Psyche yourself up, do whatever you have to do. I won't lie it stung a bit, but a few minutes later I was back. Maybe it'll be slightly awkward when I see her again but I'm past caring. Next time I like a girl enough to embarrass myself for, I'll be posting again👍

Edit: Honestly it feels like some of you are more hurt than I was. And I'm sorry about that. This is a tough situation and everything can't have a Hollywood ending.. But we move on:)"
My Online Dating Experience - Flow Chart Style,"https://imgur.com/a/gAXA3Qt

Sincerely,

A increasingly confused and frustrated guy

_-_-_-_-_-_-_--_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-



Made this today during the time on which I should have been on a date had I not been stood up once again. Figured I'd put my frustration to use with something so that you guys can have a laugh either with me or at me.

In all seriousness though, I am doing my very best to keep any frustration and jadedness out of my interactions but it's getting harder and harder. It's starting to look like I'm going to have to take a break.

Why do girls agree to a date enthusiastically and then either ghost or just not show up? What would be the harm in saying ""sorry I'm not interested"" and unmatching? At least we wouldn't be wasting each other's time!

Since I started seriously doing the online dating thing 2 months ago, I've had 21 girls agree to a date in principle. Of those, 1 has come through. 12 have flaked (even though 10 of those confirmed they were in fact coming the morning of and just never did) and 8 have just stopped replying when asked when they were free. I mean just... why? I see girls complaining in their profiles all the time that they're looking for someone who's serious, that they want someone to finally take them on a date, someone who makes plans and sticks to them. These are the same people who then turn around and mess me around instead of just letting me know they're not interested when I ask them to meet up. 

And I get what people say about why people ghost, but the fact is most of these situations we haven't had each other's social media, numbers, last names, addresses or anything like that. Even if I did blow up and go psycho on them (which I absolutely wouldn't) it would be a matter of unmatching and that would be that!

Edit: Thanks for the silver & gold kind Reddit strangers! Not sure what I did to deserve it but it's appreciated regardless!"
so sick of restarting. rant with me!,"idk how many more games of 21 questions i can take, ya'll im so tired of telling guys my favourite colour and my favourite movie. i played them with people i just wanted flings with, but now i really am looking for a relationship. i hope the guy i'm talking to now will be the last one i play 21 questions with for a while! 

It's all 'cause one day I looked at my sister n her boyfriend and realised, i wanna take the same guy to every family party,  bring the same guy home and wake up with one name on my phone everyday. sadly, haven't found a guy i'm really compatible with. 

why is it so tough out here. sigh."
The appeal of female virginity?,"So I am a 22 year old female. I have decided to not have sex until I am married, as I wish go devote myself to one person only. And I wish to build a life with that person. I am not religious. I just belive that love and sex is intertwined and should be between 2 people who will take on the world together. (also take into account my definition of virginity means no sexual acts of any kind) 

So there is a man I am interested in, and we have been chatting for over a year now and finally the topic of sex came up and I explained my views that I am waiting for marriage to have sex and I explained my views on the subject.

His response was first shocked, he first asked how can a attractive woman not have sex into her 20s? And then went on talking about how my views are a bit childish, but good at heart.

Since telling him this information although we chat everyday he is more interested in me. Although he has brought up marriage in the past with me before this conversation twice (I rejected him both times before), he seems to be pushing for marriage again. And wants to meet my parents and tells me about how he can be a good provider.

My question is why is it now that he knows I'm a virgin is he pursuing me even more than before, it's almost like he's scared to loose me now that he knows.

I would love a males perspective😊thank you"
"Explanation for ""hell yes/no"" culture?","I see a lot of ppl responding to questions about feeling uncertain or unsure about a potential partner with ""if it's not hell yes then it's hell no."" That's pretty extreme.

It's as if lately we encourage highly emotional decision-making in dating and rationality is getting lost. When did it become not OK to have some doubts when first getting to know a new person? Why isn't it OK to question or challenge your feelings about a new person? Serious relationships can develop slowly. Can't it be argued that a slow steady relationship build is preferable to quick and careless, so to speak? Using critical thinking in new relationships sounds good to me, rather than going with highly charged instincts. 

Full disclosure, my recent semi long term relationships started with ""hell yes"" and little questioning. And they were all bad decisions in the long run. So this question of *where did rationality in dating go* is partly personal as well as a general observation."
I've been ghosted by 28 of my last 30 attempts at dating,"First of all, by ""attempt at dating"" I am refering to having either matched and subsequently talked to, or met and subsequently talked to a girl. I dont count getting ghosted directly after a match by not getting a reply to my first message.

Also, I have stopped double-texting long ago. If you dont reply to my message within a week, or, even worse, leave me on ""read"" for a whole week, I consider myself ghosted and will remove you from my contacts.

I consider myself an average looking guy, a 7 on a good day, slightly chubby. I work out but I guess I need to work on my diet as well. 25, got my own place, own car(s), working in IT. In many ways I am a stereotypical introverted nerd, with the exception that I usually dont have troubles communicating with people. Which makes it even worse to be ghosted, since it just shows that even more ""socially adjusted"" people are worse at communication than a ""socially awkward geek"".

Since the beginning of 2019 I had roughly 30 shots at dating women as outlined in my first paragraph. From a dating app standpoint that might not be alot, but what can a 6-7/10 chubby geek do, amiright?

Of the 30 girls I met 8 of them through normal means and 22 of them through OLD. Honestly I dont try to differentiate between the two, OLD should just be a shortcut to meeting people the normal way anyway.

I actually **got a second date with ONE** of them. In fact, I got all the way. Best sex I have ever had honestly and we had a brief FWB thing but it ended when she actually got a real boyfriend, since I wasnt looking for a serious relationship at the time. Still, she was probably the most mature out of all of them, and she was 22 years old.

Another **one** was up-front with me, albeit only 6 hours before our first date. Apparently she had another date the day before and the guy was so great she was going to just roll with it. Might have been an excuse, might have not, but at least she told me anything.

And thats where the ""positive"" experiences end and the sad shit starts.

**Three** of them ghosted me after the first date. Fine, I probably didnt make a good first impression. Maybe I just wasnt attractive in person. Maybe I was overbearing, or too quiet. Maybe there just wasnt any spark. But please, telling me ""Sure, we can do this again."", then ghosting me two days later is the worst of the worst.

**10** of them ghosted me after exchanging numbers, which is probably the weirdest thing. In modern day dating culture exchanging numbers is pretty much the equivalent of being ""in"". If you give somebody your number you kind of let them into your social circle. So why ghost them right after? It literally happened to me that I got a girls number, we exchanged like 5-6 messages on Whatsapp and then I was left on read forever. Why? Just why?

And the **15** others, well, they all ghosted me on a dating app itself, which I dont consider worth talking about, because its (sadly) just par for the course. Get a match, talk to match, get a better match, ghost first match and so on and so forth. Ive learned to not even waste a single thought on people who ghost on dating apps, because its just that easy.

Overall it paints a rather sad picture. I am not mad for not having gotten laid with 30 women, in fact over half of them had in the end turned out unattractive for me, but even then just getting to know them for some much needed perspective is always fine for me.

What makes me sad is just how less others tend to care anymore. Dating is no longer about getting to know other people and see if youre compatible, its fishing for your perfect opposite which will never exist and everyone else is just thrown aside. And OLD is nothing but a game these days, except with real people. 99% of people on OLD actually have zero space for more people in their lives, they just like the brief distraction and confidence boost of playing the game."
I met the guy who will be my boyfriend,"So I'm single for not THAT long. Before that I was in a relationship for 10 years, with the three last years long distance. Our relationship was over long before we ended it for real. So, at 26 years old, I've never been single as an adult, never add other experiences. 

I started dating for fun, casual things, just for the experiences. I didn't want to jump in another relationship right away.

But yesterday I met the guy who will be my boyfriend, I can bet both my hands on that. We talked and we have so much in common. And he is 110% my type physically. I feel like a dumb teenager who have a big crush for the first time.

I bet you that in a couple months, I will go back on this sub and will tell you how my new boyfriend is awesome ;)

I feel it in my guts that it's him."
I DO NOT WANT YOUR GOOD MORNING TEXTS,"Its so annoying when I’m talking to a guy I’ve just matched with on an app and a day or two into the conversation he starts sending those good morning cutesy texts. No. Don’t. I don’t want to be cutesy with a stranger and frankly, I’m not super invested yet. We haven’t even met. Sorry to be harsh but it just grinds my gears. It’s such a turn off. Does anyone else feel that way?

Idk maybe I’m just gay...but that’s for another post lol"
"If women never initiate conversations with you, does it mean you're facially unfortunate?","22 year old virgin guy here. I have never in my life had a women start a conversation with me, unless it was a waitress asking me what I'd like to order. And even when I do initiate, I get one word answers and they walk off. Along with getting zero matches and replies on dating sites, is it safe for me to assume that I'm unattractive?"
[28M] Okay I've had enough. Is it just me or is modern dating damn frustrating and depressing?,"I am \[28M\] and I've never had a serious relationship before. I was one of those people who didn't really look into dating until I was probably around 26 years old when I finally achieved my career goals - I am a fulltime health professional and own my own house, car, things I want in life etc. Doesn't mean I didn't take fancy on anyone or thought about dating but I was more focused on my career, enjoying life with friends and family prior to that point.  I did like someone at uni, been close with her and unfortunately before I can make a move, she moved to the other side of the country because she changed uni and we pretty much drifted apart.

I've done every dating app under the sun since I was 26. Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, POF and just recently CMB. You guys probably know what sort of people you get on those apps. Dead accounts, bots, people who ghost you for no reason, people who deleted their account despite you guys having good banter, people who only want sex etc. Bit of a nightmarish journey (I even had a girl who said that 'I dont date enough women' when I complimented her on looks...I mean seriously?). Been on tons of dates with mostly disappointing results (but plenty of hilarious dating horror stories as a result). Hell, I even signed up to eHarmony this year after one of my close work colleagues promoted it because one of her friends found her husband on there (""Because if people pay money for it, they'll know what they want and actually want to date""). It's been 4 months or so since I signed up. Matched with a dozen or so girls but most of them dont respond to any messages (Oh great, just like those dating apps). Dated a few. And guess what? Not much different from the 'free' apps.

And when you finally nail a second, third, fourth date, it just fizzles either due to red flags or ghosting/rejection. I speak to my sister and my female friends about my dates and yes, we all screw up sometimes but most of the time, they pinpoint the issue being with the date and not me (""It's not you, it's her""). I am kind of introverted but people would describe me as bubbly, kind, funny and easy-going. I dont think I am bad-looking either (I am no Henry Cavill but I score plenty of matches easily on apps). Why is it this difficult? I take breaks for sure from dating but when I finally head back in, it feels like running a gauntlet of unpleasantness to the point where I think I should just give up and become that cool single rich uncle who's always travelling the world.

Not only that, you have to put up with the judgement of your colleagues, friends, family and relatives. ""Oh are you being picky?"" ""Why do you not ask her out? She looks nice!"" ""Wait you dont have a girlfriend?"" ""Oh so you're not seeing her anymore? See you scared her off!"" ""You'll find someone - you just have to put yourself out there!""

I know modern dating is hard but is this what other people have to put up with too?
Maybe I should stop 'trying/being pro-active' and let destiny take its course -  ""You'll find love when you stop looking""?"
A thank you for girls that start up a convo,"I am a 20 year old guy who has been in a few relationships before not very long sadly. Might be a me problem too but it feels so mentally draining to always have to text first, think of what to talk about and keep a convo going. 

For a few weeks now I am texting/seeing this girl and it is honeslty a life changer. No pressure to start convos, she likes to talk about herself, she is a good listener, sends me stuff she finds funny. Even tho we are still at hugging phase I just wanted to tell guys like me: there is hope boys.

Jokes aside i guess there are others like this but it really makes you feel special. Weird how it took me 7 years to find this."
Dating apps are based only on appearance,"So I installed few apps recently to check them out (Tinder, Bumble, Badoo) and what really shocked me is that nearly noone has any bio written about themselves. What is the point of that? For me it looks like they want to be swiped right based only on appearance. There is also a lot of profiles with one sentence (punch?)line which also doesn't tell anything about that person. And everyone has a fountain of photos. I really don't understand that."
Great Date Takes a Hilarious Turn...,"Hey guys, i’ll try to keep this brief but this is hilarious and I had to share somewhere, so here I am. I (21F) am not a big “dater”, i’ve been single most of my adolescent life all but a few flings, the longest of which lasted 6 weeks! Lol with that being said as I am coming to the end of my college  career I have had a lot more free time and my girl friends decided they wanted to hook me up with someone. So they set me up with this guy (22M) who was a mutual friend through one of their boyfriends.

They gave him my snapchat and he snapped me almost immediately. I didn’t know what I was expecting but when I opened it I was actually pleased, he was really handsome. So we talked back and forth for about a day or two and then I gave him my number and we arranged a “date”. We went to a bar off campus, one of the nicer ones where drinks are kind of expensive. I didn’t know what to expect from him in person, he seemed cool through text but that can be deceiving.

After a couple of drinks I really actually like the way he was acting and treating me but obviously everyone puts their best foot forward on the first date. Anyways he made me laugh and smile for like 3 hours or so and after he asked if I wanted to go back to his place with him to hang out some more. So I agreed... I didn’t get the vibe that he just wanted sex.........

We left the bar and he drive me back to his place, “Whenever you wanna go home i’ll give you a ride just say the word” is exactly what he told me. He lived in this nice apartment complex on campus, while we waited on the elevator he kissed me which I was okay with. His place was nice, and tidy. His roommate fled to the room almost on cue when we came in. We sat on his couch and ate Ice cream, he said it was all he had to offer which was cute.

Anyways, we watched a little bit of Rick & Morty, then the alcohol caught up with me and I had to pee. I asked where the bathroom was and he showed me then I went. I peed, and stared at myself in the mirror for a second. I go back out to the Living room, and there sits my date.... Only he doesn’t have any clothes on, and no underwear either. LOL, and his dick was hard......  and big.

I stood there in shock, partly because he was naked, and partially because of the size of his dick lol. The only sentence my dumb ass could piece together was “Oh my..” He just looked at me I couldn’t read his expression, but my mouth dropped open and i covered it with my hands. He laughed a little and said “No?” and started covering himself up then he told me he was really sorry and asked if I wanted him to take me home. I felt really bad but I said yeah, I really liked him physically and like we clicked but i’m not a first night kind of girl. When we got to my place he apologized again. I told him it was fine honestly and then before I got out of the truck I said “Let’s hang out again, & maybe i’ll see your dick again sometime soon.” He smiles and laughed really hard, he said let’s definitely hang again and apologized and kissed me and told me good night.

Lol I really like him he was goofy and that just was really funny and I’m supposed to see him again tomorrow, kinda nervous lol! If anyone ends up caring i’ll update this haha!

tl;dr my date and i had a great time, maybe we weren’t in the same exact page though lol"
Why god why use manipulated photos of yourself on online dating apps?,"I matched with a girl a few weeks back and I was instantly like “wow she is so out of my league”. I carried the conversations and eventually she asked to chat on Messenger instead. She said she swiped me right because I’m an INTJ and I couldn’t really put this anywhere, lol. Conversations started to be finally more two sided. We had the “past relationships” thing come up and she talked like she is always wanted by guys and she treated them like trash, but: “you’re different, you’re funny, good looking, etc”. She kept sending me actually REALLY good selfies. She even sent a few one captioned “no makeup lol” and she was still beautiful.

We eventually set up a date after a few weeks of talking (work and stuff got in the way on my part). The day before we were meeting she told me how “this city’s air makes her skin look like shit” but she still sent a selfie and still nothing to be bothered about. She also kept saying how she is out with her friends and guys keep checking her out. I was like weird flex but ok. The day comes, she texts me “I’m not wearing makeup today btw” but I was like okay sure it’s fine, I prefer “natural” look anyway. We meet up and wow. I’m not all about looks but her face looked NOTHING like the photos she sent me and the ones she used on Tinder. I’m not saying small details looked off, but I swear nothing looked “right”. 


She hugged me and told me I look so much hotter in person than on my photos (I hate photos of me and I guess it shows lol) and I simply said “yeah sorry but I can’t say the same”. She obviously got awkward and admitted that she likes to draw and play around with photoshop, etc and she always touches up photos. I figured if there’s chemistry, fuck the looks let’s give it a go. The date was so bad. Like top notch awkward. I ended up telling her I don’t want anything I don’t have time for a relationship and I just don’t feel the vibe. She said “oooh I don’t want a relationship, I’m always like this with my friends”. Okay sure, I walked her to her bus and headed home. She kept texting me for days. I told her I’m busy with work and we haven’t talked for 2 days now.


What did she expect? I’d fall in love with her through text and I wouldn’t notice/care about how fake she was? She said the friend thing because she thinks she can eventually “win me over”? I’m not a guy about looks but FUCK it just made me furious. Even the fucking selfies she sent me has been touched up in PS. What on Earth did she think she will achieve?"
"It seems these days the main indicator of being is a relationship with someone, is daily good morning/night texts.","I knew my first relationship was going well once the daily text began, and I knew it was ending once they started to falter. Every relationship after followed this pattern. Is this the same for everyone else too?


Note: I am not talking about  exchange volume of text messages as an indicator, just that when you find yourself consistently and daily, sending/receiving a good morning/night text, it may mean you have an established relationship."
You can't have your cake and eat it too...,"You (27F) can hate me (27M) all you want but I am not obligated to stick around in your life if I know it'll hurt me. You wanted to date other guys, so why are you so shocked when I say that I'm finished with you? If those other guys want to play around, they can do it all they want. But I know I deserve better than to be just one of who the hell knows how many side dates. You hate me for the simple fact that you can't have me. You can't just have every guy, deal with it!"
I’m fed up with this crap,"How can you text me something like that and then just not respond to me?! I am so sick of playing games, I just want a dude to be straight up with me and not jerk me around and “care” but then not step up when I reciprocate. I think I need to step back from dating and just work on everything else going on in my life, but I cared about him! I’m willing to make time for him because I want to see him, and it’s just either not enough or someone else has come along and they’re a better option. I’m tired of my emotions being played with. I don’t do games and I’m tired of the dating game. Don’t tell me you like hanging out with me and want to see me more if it’s not true on your end.

EDIT: this was just supposed to be a rant post to the void so my anxiety brain could calm down a little, none of y’all were supposed to really see this. Solidarity to my people going through the same stuff"
Worst feeling in the (dating) world: Someone finally getting 'over' you,"The texts become shorter...
The conversations become less interesting...
The previously lengthy responses become one worded...
The mystery soon fades & they know your next moves like clockwork. 

And then you find yourself becoming pathetic, looking at your old text messages when you're up at 3 AM simply to try to feel those feels again & harp on what once was. 

Maybe I also miss who I was when we were together.

Clearly I'm the most fun at parties lately, r/dating. "
This is for everyone.,I just wanted to remind you today that you are strong enough getting out of bed in the morning when it feels like hell. You are brave for doing things even though they scare you or make you anxious. And you are amazing for trying and holding on no matter how hard life gets. 😊 You're doing good today and that's fine. 💛💛 Have nice day ahead! 😉💛😘
"Dating is a process, do it for yourself and have fun.","So tonight I'm feeling a little discouraged. I've been going out on casual dates and tbh they've been fun. Going to local comedy shows, grabbing beer and having engaging conversation, getting out there in the world with someone new and seeing what comes of it. It's been fun, and tbh its exciting to meet new people in new places and take in the world together so to speak. On the heels of this I've started posting online to cast a wider net and Idk if it's just online dating, but it seems as though every time I meet a woman online and they see I'm a thick/heavy dude they politely bow out, but in person my physique doesn't seem to bother the women I talk to/ go out with? I'm not sure if I< am missing something or if that's just how it is online? Insight would be appreciated."
"How much do I owe him? (I'm 28F, he's 34M)","I have been chatting with this guy since the beginning of October, for our fourth date I went to his condo to watch Netflix (with the idea being that I would sleep over) but his place was SO DIRTY and so stinky - which made me so uncomfortable that I left ... I managed to contract a horrible flu from him, have been dead to the world for two weeks ... and now he's asking for clarity.  


I left late at night, telling him that I was uncomfortable. I texted him on the way home apologizing for the drama. The next day I explained that it was the lack of hygiene and cleanliness in his place that made me uncomfortable - and he was shocked. He said that he cleaned for hours before I came over. I want to just leave it as is, but he has asked for specific examples for why I was uncomfortable...   


The place was so stinky that it was as if the air was thick?? If it was my job to clean the place up I honestly would have no idea where to start, just burn it down and start fresh? As soon as I stepped foot in the door I felt like I should get out ASAP. He was a really nice guy, a bit socially awkward. I keep thinking that this nasty condo of his will end every relationship that he tries to get into for the rest of his life? Do I owe him a slap in the face wake-up call of an answer?? Or can I leave it as is?"
Deleted all of my online dating profiles for good.,"I've come to realize that I just can't properly present myself or my personality in a cohesive and interesting way online. Along with that, it was starting to take a negative toll on my self image and worth. To me, it's time to pull the plug when I feel like I'm not getting anywhere with no responses from potential matches and felling unattractive and ugly. I don't know, maybe my standards are too unrealistic, but real human interaction has always worked out better for me then on the internet anyway. So I guess I'll have to get out and do this the old fashioned way."
I don’t get guys... like at all.,"I was walking to the tube today after i had a tutorial and as i was crossing a main road at around 1pm this afternoon, in a very public and open area. Me and this guy made eye contact... Pretty normal but then i looked away and then i looked to cross the road and he was still looking. 

Then we crossed the road and he started chatting to me. Seemed pretty normal. 

Then he was like “you’re really pretty, you must think i’m nice too hehe” i had my headphones in so kinda missed bits of it but then he asked for my name and where i lived. I said east. He said he lived west. 

Then he said “oh you seem really nice can i get your number or something i’d like to get to know you.

 I was like okay...gave him my number. He’s like when are you free. I’m like not until Friday/Saturday. He for some reason won’t believe this although i’ve told him i have deadlines... 

Then he was like cool, can i have a kiss i was like LOL no. Then he was like “come on don’t be shy.” And i was like “i’m alright thanks.” But he just keeps asking, then asks if i can kiss him and i’m saying “no. I don’t do that.  Sorry.” and then i’m like “right, i’m going this way now...” and he’s like “ok hug goodbye?” 

So i was like fine whatever, and then he kissed me on my cheek and i was like a bit annoyed but it’s a minor i suppose... until i realise he isn’t pulling away like you usually would post hug, he does that lingering around thing fairly close to my face and he then says “how about a proper one now?” 

I was like “are you for real?!” Like i’m pulling away quite aggressively and he’s still got me in the hug at this point. And i’m shouting “seriously, get off me” and he’s like “okok haha well i will definitely see you on saturday.” 

No you definitely will not. 

I’ve blocked his number etc. But it’s still grinding my gears that this happened. He genuinely seemed alright at the beginning. 

Not sure how i always seem to attract the nutters/unreliables/uncertain/inattentive/dishonest ones. 

But a guy i just started dating also decided today that it was too soon for him to date after being out of a relationship for 1.5 months (which is totally fine), but he told me to book mini golf for our next date a few days ago and then we hadn’t spoken over the weekend. I told him i’d booked it and he said great can’t wait and then i’ve been busy this weekend with uni work so today messaged like are we still on? And he was like i had a great time with you but i dont think im ready to date or anything yet and i don’t want to waste your time. I said that’s fine but annoying cause already booked it, he kindly paid me back. And said its a shame as i was looking forward to it and it was nice that we both weren’t wanting anything serious. I think it ended on alright terms, he said he just needed to figure stuff out with himself but he enjoyed meeting and talking to me. Didn’t really have anything to say. So that’s that. 

I’m not annoyed that we’re now not going to date, it’s not a big deal and if he needs time, that’s totally understandable and i said that to him. What i don’t get, is that had i not contacted him, when would he have contacted me?  I gave him the opportunity earlier in the week to be like oh no i don’t want to do anything, before i booked the activity. So i just don’t get why that happened, if i didn’t want to do something or i changed my mind, i would let the person know, when i change my mind. 

Anyways i’m tired of dating. Just gunna do me for a few months. 

Good luck to you all though. Today was a crappy day for relationship things. April & May have both been equally crappy for relationship things actually. 

TLDR: met a random stranger in the street who did not understand the word no. 
Guy i’d recently started dating let me go cause he wasn’t ready to date yet (totally fair and understandable) but he only let me know after i contacted him about our next date which had been already been booked and paid for.... 

Dating sucks. I’m taking a break."
Just cut someone off and I feel awfully sad about it.. but it was the right choice,"I met this guy on a dating app and we quickly became close, talked a lot and met up a couple times over the span of a month and a half.

the problem is - he kept letting me know that he was still on the fence about us because he had feelings for another girl as well, and was trying to make up his mind between us two. he even brought it up in the middle of sexting! And it obviously ruined the mood. 

nevertheless I found him genuine in that he was always 100% honest with me, and I believed he really was a good person despite the fishy situation with the other girl. but recently he started showing the obvious signs of starting to lose interest (barely keeping up with the conversation, avoided talking about meeting up, I always had to initiate the talking.. you know the deal).

I knew this was probably because he was already leaning towards the other girl, but I was annoyed that he had resorted to this mild ghosting, instead of letting me know the truth.

I initiated a conversation with him yesterday and we actually had a nice talk unrelated to his situation, but I still felt like something was not right. It just wasn’t the same anymore and he still seemed painfully distant.

today I decided to take that step and let him know that I needed to break contact (I don’t like ghosting and I rather let people know I won’t be talking to them again, even if it’s awkward) because I could see this was clearly not going anywhere. 

I went completely against my feelings here, I did feel a lot for him (still do), but I couldn’t deal with this anxiety any longer. I just feel like I was being strung along and now I realize that he probably only wanted me to hook up and sext. 

His reply was a quick apology and wished me well. I can’t help but think he let me go very easily and this dampens my mood even more.

I feel really fucking sad right now but a part of me knows it was the right decision. all I can do now is let time pass and take these feelings away.

I wanted to write this in case someone else was in a similar situation. Don’t let others string you along like I did. It will only hurt worse in the end."
Anyone else writing off 2020?,"Let’s be honest: 2020’s been a very stressful year on a macro scale. It’s hard to believe half the year has gone by with lockdowns and pandemics and what not. I had really hoped to make this year a good one, after recognizing what some of my challenges were and having a plan to overcome them. 

I had realized some time ago that a lot of this year may well go by before any sense of normalcy or safety returned. More than that, I’m sort of accepting that this whole year may well be written off. I have tried Skyping and video calls with potential dates, but it just isn’t that easy to really progress anything until you meet in person. 

I say to other singles on this sub, it’s probably best to just accept that this year won’t likely bring substantial positive change to our dating lives. And honestly, that’s ok. It’s a difficult situation that most of us can’t do much about. I’m not saying I’m happy about it in the slightest, but I am saying that accepting it means that we can at least focus on other things. 

I don’t know that I’ll stop using online dating platforms, but I’m not expecting much at this point.

What are others thinking?"
So about a month ago I posted that I didn’t wanna jinx anything with this guy that I like and,"It’s still going well! We’re gonna exchange Christmas gifts when he gets home and he’s been texting me while he’s been away, so I feel like that’s a good sign. Just super happy in general!"
I love the feeling you get right before the potential start of a relationship.,"The giddy feeling you get when you’re getting to know someone that you feel like could become some kind of romantic relationship is great. Just the feeling of excitement every time you see a notification from them your heart picks up and you just can’t wait to see what they said brings me joy. I know this stuff is really sappy and probably puke worthy but I just really feel like sharing my thoughts on this. 

I’m never sure if it’s going to become anything but it’s a great feeling until it ends. For me, 9 times out of 10 this ends in nothing and I get my hopes up just to have them torn down. I know that’s not the best thing to do to yourself but I just love the start of stuff like this. 

Edit: Put it on the line and asked her to dinner. She said she wasn't interested in me but it's okay. That's the way it goes and we are still friendly toward each other. For anyone else that this has happened to just remember that there are 7.5 billion people on this planet and there is someone out there for you. I am trying to keep that in mind myself."
"On our first date, I was told I was “annoying” and left at the sushi restaurant","I’m (F26) in my hometown visiting family and decided to browse around Bumble. I matched with my “ex boyfriend” from 2nd grade and he (M26) insisted we hang out, since he’s wanted to see me for years now. We met downtown for drinks and caught up, and I immediately felt the vibe was weird. He seemed really nervous and fifteen minutes into the “date” he said we could go back to his place to hang out and play guitar (btw.. he lives with his parents still). The date continued and I could tell he wasn’t picking up on my jokes or sarcasm. 

We went to an open mic at another bar and I said we should go on, since he kept talking about how he plays guitar and is in a couple bands and I do stand up comedy. He was pretty against it and was adamant about not going up, so I said we could leave if he didn’t want to do it. We leave and I suggest we go to a sushi place down the block. 

On the way, he tries to pull a “you have something on your face, what is that” weird, creepy, non consensual kiss thing and I rejected it immediately. The whole night he kept saying I was being “mean” (I wasn’t— I’m seriously overly nice but can be a bit sassy/snarky at times). We finally got to the sushi place and he said he wasn’t hungry so I still ordered for myself and got us a bottle of hot sake. 

The look on his face when he sat down— it looked like he wanted to kill me. Seriously, it looked like he HATED me. But I kept it cool and was asking if he liked the sake, gave him some history of rice wine, kept talking to make it less awkward. He finally said “you’re kinda annoying me.”

I thought he said something about the sake, so I said “it’s an acquired taste.” “No, I said you’re annoying me.” “Oh.. we’ll I’m an acquired taste.” He then condescendingly asked how long my last boyfriend and I were together and if I annoyed him as much. I told him that he was being rude and apologized for annoying him, but he was free to leave if he wanted to since the sushi was for me anyway. He said “yeah, I’m gonna go.” And he left. 

I’m not even upset. This guy had zero, and I mean ZERO, sense of humor. He couldn’t pick up on my sarcasm to the point that he literally thought I had watched only Beavis and Butthead for the last 10 years. 

I think, and my friends agree, that he was just upset that I wasn’t going to hook up with him that night and that’s why he got so upset. But it still hurt my feelings and was incredibly embarrassing to be left at a restaurant. I really don’t think I was being annoying (I’m a phenomenal date—especially first dates). He was just a huge douche canoe. And even if I was annoying, he could have gone about it a different way. 

Anyway.. just needed to vent. Btw, I literally hadn’t seen this guy since we were 8. Ten minutes after he left, I got a text saying “We’ve been friends all these years, no reason to act like that... sad.”"
I went on my 4th date with a girl from Tinder which ended pretty bad.,"LENGTHY STORY FROM TONIGHT'S DATE.   


So I've been seeing this girl (lets call her ""S"" )for a month now and I haven't made any moves yet because something in my gut told me to hold off until I felt like she was more comfortable around me and what not. Tonight I picked her up, bought our tickets to see Black Christmas (which was ok, but not great), and then proceeded to go to a bar across the street. I don't drink because it just doesn't taste good to me so I don't mess with it. We have a seat at the bar and the bartender comes up to us and says to S ""What would you like to drink?"" S then says ""I'd like a cranberry vodka."" The bartender then turns to me and she ask me the same thing and S says ""Oh he doesn't drink, which is so weird. I've never seen him put any alcohol in his body."" The bartender gives me a look that screams ""leave this chick alone cause she's probably crazy"". She hands S her drink and I say to her ""Damn, why'd you have to out me like that?"" in a jokingly voice. S says ""I just find it weird you don't drink and it's awkward when we go out and I drink. We can't keep hanging out if you don't drink cause it's awkward. On top of that you didn't even pay for my drink which shows your not interested in me. You also haven't initiated anything."" So i'm sitting at the bar like ""Is this chick nuts?"" and say ""If i wasn't interested in you I wouldn't ask for you to go out on dates every weekend, so I don't understand what you're talking about. Plus I haven't made moves because I don't even know if you're interested in me and I know how you get, so i'm not taking any chances until I know you're ok with that. I'm trying to not step over your boundaries. If it's a problem with you that I don't drink do  I need to leave or do you want me to stay?"" S pulls out her phone and calls her friend to pick her to take her to another bar because ""I was going to leave her"". Never said I was going to leave, I just asked did I need to leave because me not drinking bothered her so much. I have to drive home and she was my date so it's also somewhat my responsibility she makes it home safe. I said "" You know that's actually pretty rude you would call your friend to come pick you up when we are on a date and after I said we could go to Indian Queen, but you just assumed I was about to ditch you after you're the one who complained about me not drinking."" She then said ""Well you made it seem like you were gonna leave me. It's not the first time it's happened."" I told her stop comparing me to other guys she's had bad experiences with because not every guy is a fuck boy, smh. She didn't like when I said she was being rude and tried to cut me off during my sentences but I wouldn't let her. She then threaten to leave the table and walk away. I told her ""Go ahead I won't stop you."" I sat at the bar and waited for her friend to pick her up and then I took my ass home. This the 4th dates and not ONCE this month has she said Thank You. Never in my life have I encountered such a rude individual who claims that all the men she meets are fuck boys most of the time. Now I can see SHE is the issue and never takes responsibility for her fuck ups.

TL;DR: A girl stormed out on our 4th date because she was mad I didn’t buy her alcohol (when i bought everything else) and was annoyed that I wasn’t drinking alcohol at the bar when she knew i wasn’t a drinker. 

Update: for those of you saying “you should’ve known” i would’ve BEEN ended this a long time ago but I’ve never seen her act like that until tonight.

Update 2: for those who are saying “why are you going to a bar and you don’t drink?” She wanted to grab a drink before we left so we went across the street. She’s known for a month that i don’t drink and it’s never been an issue until now and idk why."
Choosing to stay single,"32(F). After a lot of thought, I’ve decided that due to my financial situation (a lot of student loan debt, no savings) I’m going to stay single for 4 more years. In 4 years I will be in a better place financially.. I’ll still have student loan debt, but no credit card debt, a higher credit score, and at least $10k in savings. 

While I know this is the best option given my situation, It makes me really sad to come to this realization. I’ve been single for 5 years already and accepting that I’ll be alone for 4 more years is heart wrenching. I also feel like my opportunity to have a family/child is quickly slipping away. 

*kicking my younger self for getting into this financial mess*

Can anyone here relate?

*Edit* I did not expect this post to get this many responses. I appreciate hearing your stories and advice SO much. Thank you to everyone of you. I’m going to re-evaluate and take your advice into consideration."
Please don't ghost other people..,"Yeah where to start here.. Im writing this down now because needed some time to process it.. So I (25) matched with this girl (25) on Tinder like over a week ago. We connected really fast and had a whole lot in common. I thought she was out of my league but whatever. We talked for like over a week and she was really cute to me, something I never had experienced. She was always happy when I did an audio message. ""I love your voice"", she said every time.

We planned a date for last thursday and we both were really looking forward to it, we also were both very nervous in meeting. Actually we wanted to meet up way earlier but I was on vacation and she had to work, so our schedule didn't really fit each other.

To note: I had taken advices from girl friends and how they met their respective partners and what I could take into my account. One thing was a friend got gifted a flower (no rose) on her first date and maybe I could convince to like me even more, I thought. So I bought a flower (I don't remember what kind) plus I bought new perfume for out meetup.

So then there is thursday, we messaged all time in the morning like we did the whole week. We both agreed on playing black light minigolf. It was something active to do but not to stuffily going out and drinking a coffee or something. She lives an hour drive away and arrived like an half an hour early. I live 10 minutes away from the place. When she told me that she is already there, I got into a polo shirt and put on my extra bought perfume. I put the flower into my inside pocket of my jacket and drove to the minigolf course. It took sometime to find a parking places but finally found one so I walked to the address. And there she was. She looked even more beautiful than on the pictures she shared to me. We hugged like 5 seconds and it was really intimate. So I gave her the flower she liked the gesture but was not super excited. We brought the flower to her car and then went on to go playing. We both payed and she went to the restroom. I waited outside after like 5 minutes, she got out and said to me she goes to the car to get a blistering plaster. This was the last time I saw her and heard from her.

I waited and waited and waited... nothing. I looked at WhatsApp - no profile picture nor online status visible for me. Went on Tinder - no more match. Facebook and Instagram - not visible for me. Snapchat - deleted. She blocked me on every single social media account. Why? WHY??? I just don't get it. I can't find a reason. Do I have a crooked nose? Did the gifted flower seem creepy? Was it to much? Whats the reason? She just drove and ghosted me right away.

I told the cashier about it. She was really nice and understanding. She offered me to go get friends and play. I called my roommate and explained it. I drove home, threw my bag in the corner and immediately hugged one girl roommate (I know it doesnt matter) and began to cry in her arms. I just couldn't get over it. What did I do wrong? I started trusting her and kinda felt some vibes coming between us. The thing also is that I opened up to this girl the day before about what I feel about my future plans, additionally we talked about intimate things like sex and stuff. Something I never had talked about to anybody because Im like a late rookie regarding that topic.

Anyway we helped one new room member, who was just moving in, unload the car and we as a group of four decided to play black light minigolf at the end of the day so that I was distracted from what happened to me.

I talked about this with my friends but I just wanted to get this rid of my heart. One advice: please guys do not ghost it seriously can fuck somebody up heavily like it did to me. If only she texted me when she was in the car and didn't want to spend time. It would have been hard but okay. The darkness in me still haunts me four days after the incident. It hard for me to get the pictures out of my head.

Thanks guys for listening. Sorry if you find any mistakes, English is not my first language. Also FUCK YOU LISA!!

TL;DR: Got ghosted at a date after intimate writing and kinda trusting a person."
WHY THE F*CK AM I NOT OVER THIS GIRL!?!?!?!?,"Seriously, we broke up *eight fucking months ago*, we only dated for *three fucking months*, she dumped me a week before my birthday, WHY DO I STILL GIVE A FUCK!?!?"
Need medical help. I'm about to close the deal with a lovely girl I'm dating and I can't stop farting acid demons.,"UPDATE:

(scroll down for original post)

&#x200B;

Before heading to her place I dipped into the HaHa cafe comedy club to rip a couple planks and with them some gas. I thought this was a great sign and that the gas could have only been associated with whatever meal those nuggets were. Laced with broccoli my guess.

&#x200B;

But as I was washing my hands I saw how bloated my guts were, big ol' gas bubble. Dead give away another low pressure system was making its way to the launch pad.

&#x200B;

I swung by Ralph’s to pick up some strawberries and Tangerlos… These fruits are un gas related it was really just not to show up empty handed because she just had a long day. 

&#x200B;

I arrive at her place… I called it a “backyard bungalow” …to explain what this is, in California homeowners outfit garages or backyard structures into studios. This is important to the story because these structures are very basic when it comes to ventilation. Her bathroom had NO FAN. Just a small window above the toilet. It was already cracked, there was no breeze, I could smell bleach so she already cleaned up the bathroom… I looked around the bathroom for anything that was a scented spray… Nothing, not even perfume. Could you imagine Chanel no5 in my ass? Or Chanel no5 farts? There was scented lotion but how is that gonna go? I wipe my ass with rose water crabtree and Evelyn hand lotion? What if it stings my asshole?

&#x200B;

\*\*\*Thought came to me\*\*\* You know those Poo-poorii sprays that you spray onto toilet water and it knocks out the smell? What if I spray a version of that either directly onto my asshole or onto the fabric of my briefs where my fart gas passes through? If the product could some way coat every airborne feces particle of my ass steam with a pleasant smell…. Well, problem solved. 

&#x200B;

But I had no spray and I don't know if such a thing exists. Would love to see that on shark tank.

&#x200B;

To add some color to the story, this girl is a stunner 5’8 Hungarian brunette with a glowing smile. She has a very warm personality and can carry an intelligent conversation. She has a strong spiritual practice that I attribute to her levity, countenance, and big ol' smile. She is a Physical Therapist so she has these great strong arms hands shoulders. 

&#x200B;

She is the tantric type that likes a slow build, push to the edge and back off of it. I am all about this and have the control to play with the brakes and tease the climax. 

However.

That is a hell of a lot of 'abdominal manipulation' read: Marches infantry to the trenches. Twice I interrupted to go to the bathroom to do a standing downward dog followed by pushing my fist into my guts trying to knead this gas bubble from stomach to my butthole. On my second visit to the bathroom I got a nice exit. But like the tantric sex I needed the release slow and controlled… I’m wording this silly right now, basically I didn’t want to blow my asshole out and blow her door down with loud ass fart noises. Again, no fan and a thin door, I’m not trying to kill this Hungarian. I achieved a steady release and it sounded like a motorcycle purring… If that is such a thing. Incidentally, I have a big muscley ass so it ain’t an easy exit, the flesh can create some serious percussion. 

&#x200B;

I don’t know how graphic people get on these things but the next section of the story is the sex…. Here it goes, so, high level is we began and finished with oral, no intercourse. It was intense, breathing was in sync, some serious eye contact, she appreciates physical strength and I was able to provide it… I’m leaving out details here… Let’s get to it. 

&#x200B;

When I was servicing her I was on my knees off the side of the bed hands gripping her forearms, her heels digging into my traps/shoulder/neck. For most of the time, when she’s not arched back, she is looking down at me and we are holding eye contact as I’m flicking away… Here’s the rub. I am essentially doggystyle. I am on my knees, ass out. This is GAS POSITION. Fuggin google it. I’m fucked. I’m controlling this girl’s existence with my tongue, eyes are locked, and I’m trying not to WINCE my face as I seal my asshole against a groaning torrent. That scene in Aliens comes to mind where she's trying to hit the airlock to blast the Queen into space. We’re like deeply connecting right? She’s seeing into me, I’ve got a good poker face, can she see in my eyes that I’m holding this thing in? The thoughts are all happening quick… I want to describe more detail but you get the point.

&#x200B;

She pounces on me, goes super slow down on me. Same ass puckering issue with a second variable: My asshole is out and is inches from her nose. 

&#x200B;

This is when I start thinking of that Poo-Pourri spray again. This is when one would spray it ON the asshole. So, for this theoretical product there would be two applications, a spray for underwear and a spray for butthole. Hell I would put a dissolving scented pill up there. I’m looking down at her and I can see the damn gas ball pushing out my abdomen.

&#x200B;

No, I didn’t rip ass on her. I’m aware this would be a better story if I did but I don't want to make stuff up. I did have to dial in the concentration though because I can’t climax thinking about farts and asshole sprays. Luckily, she is very very talented as a giver so I was able hit the uprights no problem. Hell of a calorie serving she got and as I type my face still has her on it. Which is a better scent than what my ass is giving this couch. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for all the love and comments, you guys make me laugh, this is my first reddit post.

Internet,

I made a ton of broccoli in my Instapot a couple days ago and I have two days worth of steamed broccoli coating the lining of my intestine. I thought if you steam vegetables they digest better. I am murdering the air in this Republic of Pie cafe in NoHo right now and I need to leave in like 30 minutes for her place.

Is there any last minute medicine or food or drink that ACTUALLY achieves nuclear deproliferation of the asshole??

I need to point out that she lives in a lovely backyard bungalow and if I abscond to the bathroom these beezlebubs aren't gonna stay put in her tiny bathroom. Even if I walk super slowly and shut the door immediately they will travel.

Is it obvious if I bring matches and keep lighting matches every time I need to ""pee""?

&#x200B;

Real life experience or actual medical knowledge is preferred. Thank you kindly and sorry if you're in Republic of Pie right now."
Is it just me or is it harder to date after school ends and you enter the real world as an adult ?,"In school I felt like it was easier. You could  run into a girl and get to know her in class, after class,  go to prom, etc. The opportunities were endless.

In the real world you could talk to women at work but it's  more risky and you have a job to do. If you takeaway work your only option is meeting women outside of it. There's  less time, feels like you have to try harder, bars get old, and people are more serious about dating."
To all those that feel lonely or depressed about being single.,"As someone who is 33 and has never been on a date or ever dated anyone before I Just wanted to let those of you out there that feel lonely or depressed about being single that it's ok. Just because you don't have someone else special in your life doesn't make you unlovable. There are people that do care for you. Some days being single are going to be tougher than other days, some days you'll feel incredibly more lonely than others, and some days you'll feel more broken than any other day you've felt. The important thing is to feel what You're feeling and to move past it. Don't try to bottle up your emotions just for the sake of convenience. They will build up, fester, and come out when You're at your most vulnerable state. Remember that we're only here for a short time so please do yourself a favor and enjoy as much of it as you can. "
How do I meet someone without Tinder?,"It feels kinda sad that I have to ask this, but how do you actually meet someone irl? Tinder is crushing me very slowly, and the only reason I don't delete it, is because I can't find someone to date without it.

I'm massively into gaming to the point where it's also my career, so I could easily get into a ldr, but I swore not to. And I just don't get how I could find someone irl, with gaming as a similar interest."
"[26M] Was told ""let's stay friends"", replied with politely explaining why this cannot work & stopped talking. After a few days, even though she [23F] understood, she contacted me, requesting 2nd date. Wat do?","Hey reddit!

I've gotten quite confused regarding this girl \[23F\] I've dated recently. I'm partially looking to vent, and partially looking for the opinion of internet strangers, as I deem I cannot see clearly as of now.

For some background, we're living 3 hours apart, but we both frequent each others' city and we both were even before we started dating. We've started talking \~a month ago, talked a lot through phone & texting, and had a date a week ago.

I felt the date was a success, we connected really well, both of us were chill, no signs of that typical ""first date stress"" at all. We also had sex both in the evening and in the morning, which leads me to think that she is attracted as well.

That's where it gets confusing, as I got the ""let's stay friends"" card from her in a few days. Unfortunately, I'm used to this, I might be too much of a NiceGuy ™, but this is a separate topic. However, this shocked me this time, as I genuinely thought we had a great time, and even before the date, both of us were very clear about that we are looking for something serious.

I've told her in a very polite, yet direct way that I'm not interested in being friends and that we should stop talking to avoid being hurt. Mainly my way of crawling back to my cave, when things go south.

At this point, obviously, I still could not fully understand what went wrong, but thinking that we've discussed this all, I've closed this with simply telling myself ""Not at the right time/right place""

Not even 2 days go by, I get a text from her saying she is confused, missing me and cannot understand her feelings and wants to meet to talk about this, to ""find some other solution"".

How would you decipher this? Is she being pushy on staying friends? Am I misleading myself for believing that this is her way of stating she ""changed her mind?""

I've agreed to meet up and to continue talking (possibly only until the date), but we could not find a closer date than \~2 weeks from now to meet up, which really sucks, as I'm honestly afraid of getting hurt once again in a situation like this... on the other hand, I'm also afraid of wasting an opportunity due to being afraid of getting hurt...

Any ideas/advices?"
Anyone else feel like they miss being wanted/ pursued more than the person they lost in a break up,Been spending a lot of time reflecting during this quarantine and I realized I miss the feeling of being wanted more than the guys themselves. I love having someone to talk to who I’m comfortable telling anything and everything too.
Online Matches,"I (F24) see lots of guys on reddit and IRL complain about the lack of matches they get, and how many matches women get. The guys i know, plus the guys on reddit also swipe right on every single girl they see to make their chances better. Understandably so, cast the net wide, you'll be bound to catch something. I cant speak for every girl, the the girls i know dont swipe on every guy, they are a bit choosy, hell, my BFF will send me screenshots of guys profiles and ask me what i think, and we'll talk about it before she makes her decision, thats just before she even swipes right, for all she knows, he might not like how she looks. it got me thinking about how women and men play the online dating game very differently.

&#x200B;

If every guy swipes right on EVERY girl, and every girl swipes right on SOME guys, of course women are going to have more matches. It's over-saturated at this point. Also, just because a girl may have 100+ matches, it doesn't meant that shes talking to 100+ guys. 1/2 of them are bots or catfishes, i guarantee it, many dont answer, LOTS are looking for one night stands and hookups, and then there are maybe a handful out of that group of men are are actually compatible with the woman they matched with. i admit, i get lots of matches, and i message them, but not everyone talks to me, because even though they swiped right on me, i'm not their preference. Ive had guys swipe right on me, i say hello, and then immediately unmatch me lol. It happens to us all!

&#x200B;

Not to mention, people have different tastes, i know its hard to not compare yourself to some Calvin Klein model looking dude and think, ""if he isnt matching with every woman, what chance do i have"". But you have to remember, not everyone likes that, people have different tastes and preferences. I'm short, and i am VERY hesitant on going out with guys over 6 feet, because it feels weird to me, i know that guys who are over 6 feet tall are popular online for some reason, but know that not every girl likes it. Yes, online dating is extremely shallow, and i get my ass kicked on it too, i'll be the first to admit it, but it is a good way to meet people, and not every meetup needs to end in a relationship, maybe a friendship can come out of it. If you find yourself getting in a dark place mentally from these apps, take a break from them, its ok, i do it, my friends do it, your peace is the most important part of this

&#x200B;

Men, please dont think i am diminishing your struggle with online dating, because that isnt the point of this post. Women have to wade through A TON of bullshit on these apps, and i think its nice if we can see each others perspective from time to time. Please, just safeguard your mental health on the battlefield of love."
Is it true that guys won’t approach girls they find attractive because they are scared of getting rejected?,"I don’t believe this is the case - but my friends seem to think that guys will not approach me because they are scared of rejection. This is in no way me claiming to be super attractive - I’m average, but I know I dress nicely and am good with hair/makeup so pull myself together reasonably well. 

I’ve been single for a year and only been asked on two dates - both I had to semi initiate...I’m starting to get resentful about the lack of proper attention I receive. Sure, guys message me on Instagram all the time, but when it comes to a real life scenario, I rarely get approached, unless it’s by really cocky/overly confident guys (which I’m not interested in). 

What should I do in this situation? 
"
I want to catch the feels.,"I want to love again, I want to openly fall for someone without the fear of being labeled as that ""clingy"" girl

I want to trust and to feel excited and hopeful and not to have it all ripped away from me time and time again 

I don't want to be the cool girl, the ""independent"" or ""prude"" girl

I just want to fucking date you

You asshole.


Sincerely, my bottle of vodka

edit: because I don't want this to be a bashing post, honestly I still think DTR-ing ASAP is the best move (guy or girl) and that if the person you are open with doesn't reciprocate those feelings, they aren't worth it anyway because they aren't on the same page. Dating is rough but we still have some control over protecting our feelings and if you do everything in your power to do that all you can do is down a bottle of vodka, say fuck you, and realize there is better out there. Love you all and wish you the best <3"
"I'm a girl, I asked a guy out and he said no","Just wanted to tell someone! At the end of the day, I was disappointed but its way better knowing than continuing to like someone. Ask your crushes out, people! 

"
Man up and stop being so scared,"I'm so exhausted from dating and talking to men to see where it will go. It feels like my entire year has been spent on meeting men who are scared or think they're not good enough or intimidated by me or scared to be vulnerable. I'm so exhausted by all of this. 

Stop judging a book by its cover. Just cus a girl has her shit together and is presentable and attractive doesn't mean you're not worthy or she'll break your heart. Stop being afraid to go for it and give it a chance. Stop being so scared to open your heart.

People think being attractive makes it easier to date and they are wrong. I'm nothing special but sure you can classify me as ""attractive"" and smart and somehow this intimidates some men. Great.

All I want is to find love. Real love with someone  that means something. Why is that so hard?? Sigh. :(

EDIT: This definitely brought out quite a lot of emotions in some. I get it, maybe it sounded sexist and that I'm trying to blame men for everything. It's not that. I know it's not always cus Im intimidating. A situation happened this week and this was brought up that got me frustrated. Do I think all men are as I described above? No. Im just another girl who genuinely wants to find something meaningful and was a bit frustrated today. All the best to all of you!"
I hit on guys in real life now,"Ive [27F] been frustrated with online dating for a pretty long time and made a promise to myself to ask out at least one guy on a date this year.

 Yesterday i had my first IRL non tinder date from a guy i picked up at a cafe. We had a blast and just chilled in a park making out. it ended up being a great confidence booster and made me excited to try it again. He said i was really forward and that it was refreshing. 

Basically ill just walk by them,make eye contact, and if they seem to stare back ill smile and say something like, ""hey youre a total babe, did you know that?"" 

Theyll usually laugh, say thank you or tell me they think im a babe too and then ill ask for their number.

I think we as women are pretty scared of rejection and are quite used to waiting for guys to make the first move. But i want you guys to know that theres something freeing about being open with your emotions
 Asking out men or flirting makes me feel in control and sexy. It doesnt have to be awkward or silly, although it helps if youre quite extroverted.

So heres a question:

Guys: how do you feel if a woman asks you out? Are you creeped out? Do you ever expect it? Does it make you feel emasculated (as silly as that sounds) also, if i use that line, does it sound like i just want to fuck? 

Ladies: would you ever do this? Was it worth it? Do you still do.it?"
How to get out of the “forever alone/single” mindset,"I’m a 25 year old straight guy and I can’t get out of the forever alone or forever single mindset. I haven’t really had a girlfriend since high school and even that wasn’t a super long term relationship. 

I’ve got a great career and lots of great friends, but one area of my life I wish was different is my love life. I think part of the reason I don’t really have one is I’ve been focusing on my career and stuff so I kind of put it to the side. 

But now that I’m ready to start looking, I don’t really have any confidence at all. I’m overweight which certainly doesn’t help (I’m looking to improve this as well by losing weight and getting in shape, but that’s a different conversation). I have Tinder/bumble and I do get matches but nothing ever comes out of it (mostly my fault). I’m great at talking to women over text and Snapchat but I never actually make the next step to go on a date or hang out with them even though they always ask “when are we going to hang out?” And all that kind of stuff. I don’t know why I just never go to that next step, maybe because I’m not truly interested in them?

I also have never been the type to go out of my way to talk to strangers. If I’m in a bar with friends, I really just talk to my friends and never have the balls to approach a girl at all. Is this some sort of social anxiety or something, or just shyness? 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice from those of you that have been through this kind of thing because whenever I bring it up to friends, they always just say “you’ll find someone!!”

Edit: just wanted to make it clear that I’m not depressed or anything like that. I’m a very happy person and enjoy almost all aspects of my life, I just want to finally focus on my love life"
Happy!,Today I ended stuff with someone who was manipulating me and emotionally feeding off of me. I tend to get myself into relationships where this is the case. I acknowledged it was bad and that my feelings are/were valid. I am happy I got myself out of this because I feel like it could’ve gotten worse. And I am so proud of myself
Walking away is beneficial,"If someone loses interest in you then the best thing to do is to not chase after them and instead walk away.

Whenever I feel like the spark has died, I walk away. I delete them off social media, why? 

Deleting them helps in several ways:

-It shows you aren’t needy and are willing to move on.

-It helps with your mental health. You won’t be posting on social media in the hope that they see/ in an attempt to impress them. 

-You won’t see what they’re up to, which can make you jealous if it seems like they are living a better life than you. 

-You won’t feel the need to stalk their profiles and think about them.

-You can clear that mental space that the person has been taking up and focus on self-improvement.

I’ve unfollowed several girls I’ve had a thing with in the past and they done one of two things:

-Chased after me, shows they’re interested.

-Never messaged me again, shows that they aren’t interested.

Either way I’ve won."
I just realized that I must really like this guy,"Not officially dating yet.... but I just realized tonight that I must seriously care and love this guy I have been talking to. I made a small batch of Homemade Mac and Cheese last weekend and he loved it. I told him I would make a bigger batch this weekend for him. I am normally asleep right now.... I just finished making the Mac and Cheese for later today. He likes my College-student cooking (Minimal cooking) so I guess that is good. 

Small little post about that so yeah. I guess a way to a man's heart in some cases is with food."
Passing a note on a plane,"Almost five years ago, I was in line to board a plane to go back home. I saw a cute girl a few people ahead of me and wanted to ask her out, but didn't want to put her on the spot and make her uncomfortable. I also didn't know if she was leaving home or going home. I got onto the plane hoping her seat was near mine and I could try strike up a casual conversation and she how it goes from there. She was about 10 rows in front of me. I nervously wrote her a note and worked up the courage to walk it up to her. Of course, she was in the window seat. I had to awkwardly ask a stranger to pass a note to another stranger for me. In the note I explained that I thought she seemed like one of those girls that is shy and doesn't realize how beautiful she is. I also mentioned that based on her interactions with the airport staff, while in line, I got the impression that she was very polite and she seemed like an all-around good person. I gave a little info about myself and the general area in which I live. Then, I asked her to text me if she would be interested in going on a date and listed my full name and phone number. Oh, also, I asked her to include the color of her backpack in the text, so I knew it was her. I couldn't actually recall the color at the time of writing the note, but figured this would discourage anyone that might find the note from messing with me for fun. I didn't expect to receive a response from her. I figured it would probably come across in one of two ways, creepy or endearing, but I took my chance.

She texted me back about 40 minutes after the flight landed. Here's what she said:
""My name is Brooke and I was on your flight from New Orleans to Detroit with a maroon backpack. Thank you, for you kind words. I deeply admire you for taking a chance. I actually live in Boston and have a boyfriend who I love. You sound like a great, thoughtful guy, and I wish you all the best in your life! Keep putting yourself out there and sharing what you see in others -- we all have our own (sometimes small) ideas about ourselves, right? Enjoy your Sunday and safe travels home."" So, even though it didn't work out the way I had hoped, I thought it was awesome that she reached out anyway. 

Don't be afraid to take a chance, even if it's a long shot. Hopefully, this story is helpful to at least one person in some way. Thank you, for reading."
"PSA: Women, PLEASE pay your guys compliments if you're dating them. I was led on by this one girl for 5 months who never complimented me and it made me feel like absolute SHIT","**EDIT:** I shouldn't have to be saying this because it is already in the post, but I had **asked her out on several occasions** and she came up with another bullshit excuse each time. Not to mention that **she even asked me to drive to her place on several occasions** and then refused to give me her address.

*Yes, Reddit... I know I should have spotted the signs earlier and that she likely was using me for attention. But that's besides the point.*

In early December 2018, I matched with this one really cute girl. She was a bigger girl with short, black hair. Our conversations quickly moved over to Snapchat. We immediately developed great chemistry: We shared a lot of common life interests, personality traits, and even sexual fetishes.

We would often sext each other. She would frequently post sexy selfies on SC where she would show a lot of skin, and this would sometimes lead us to sexting when I complimented her. I would also sometimes send her snaps in order to get her attention.

Anyway, 5 months passed and she never met up with me. I was played like a fool; every time she came up with an excuse ""I'm PMSing"", ""I'm sick"", ""I have a party to go to"", ""I got called into work"", etc. and even when she asked me to come see her, she never gave me her address. So I ended things. But I noticed one really hollow and unfulfilling aspect of this.

I never got any compliments. Not a single one on how I looked. She never complimented my hair, face, eyes, body, member, no, NOTHING. I got *ONE* compliment telling me how she loves a ""thick daddy"" (I'm 6'2"" and 201 pounds so just a tiny bit chubby, not overweight). I would always compliment her on how sexy her stomach/boobs/ass/thighs/etc. looked, and she loved it and ate it all up. But I NEVER got any compliments beyond ""cutie"" or ""sexy"". Nothing *specific* as to how I looked.

I know that I'm not ugly. My physical appearance is something that I'm quite confident about, and I have been described as having ""no bad features"". But good lord, I cannot even begin to describe how un-sexy this whole ""relationship"" made me feel.

Women, if you like a guy, PLEASE give them compliments on their physical appearance - and ones that are very specific as to how they look. It really goes a long way."
[Vent] I just got stood up on a home cooked dinner date and I spent $60 on ingredients.,"So I was so supposed to have this dinner date with a guy. We’ve met up before and he liked that I know how to cook well. I’m not saying I’m a chef but I throw down in the kitchen. I bought fresh veggies and meat from the locals farmers market, bought all organic ingredients, and some wine out of my budget. He’s a no show. And I haven’t received a call or text for 5 hrs now. I haven’t texted him for 3 hrs. I texted once since our last full convo asking him if he was still coming. It’s past 9pm where I live. 90% of me thinks that maybe something came up, a family emergency or something and he’ll call me later. But that 10% knows I’ve been ditched. Guess I’m eating local handmade sausage and slow roasted tomato sauce over parmesan polenta with sautéed fresh zucchini and mushrooms by myself. This wine I spent $20 on better be good. I even shaved my legs and wore a cute dress. "
"If someone didn't find you physically attractive, would you rather they be honest?","Or would you rather they lie and say it's something else?

Or would you just prefer they state it in a generic manner, ie ""you're not really my type/I don't think we'd make a good match.""

I posted these a few days ago, but it was deleted because I forgot a flair."
Went on one date and am already head over heels for this guy. Is that crazy?,"I feel crazy because I usually take things really slow when I start to date, but I’m so into this guy it’s nuts! We’ve been talking on the phone and texting nonstop. We went on one date and it was incredible! I’ve never been so nervous that I’m going to fuck something up before. He’s so sweet and happy and lovely and beautiful. I think he likes me too! God, it feels crazy and like my feelings are developing really quick. I feel like I need to slow down and relax almost! Man, keep your fingers crossed for me guys!! I’m excited to see where this goes :-)

EDIT: Sounds like a lot of you have been burned. I’ll err on the side of caution and try to slow down, but I’m not turning down my excitement. Thank you for all the input, and thank you to all those who shared my positivity!"
"I think it's incredibly insulting to say, ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" if we met on a dating app.","EDIT: Probably important to preface this post: the primary app I use is Hinge. It's supposed to be a relationship-oriented app. It's not like I'm on Tinder and getting mad that nobody there wants a relationship.
   
Ghosting is barely half the issue. I'm just burned out from talking to someone, even going on a date or two only for them to say, ""I'm not ready for a relationship."" I think, above all else, that's the most insulting thing I hear. Because it means, ""I'm actually not ready for a relationship but I also want to be on dating apps and get attention from people"" OR ""I don't like you but I don't want to tell you that I don't like you"". Hell, one time I was having a really good conversation with someone, only for them to ask me for a picture of myself (I mean, we met on a dating app, so she knew what I looked like already?) They immediately followed that with, ""oh, i'm not ready for a relationship right now.""  
   
Maybe you all have different opinions. I'd just like to hear some logic either way. Maybe it's a hot take, but I'd simply rather get ghosted. I'm not tone deaf, I'll take the hint. 
   
Seriously, how do I meet someone without going through this BS? 
   
EDIT: After some thought and reading the comments, I think my frustration is this: many people who use dating apps simply don't know what they want and I do. Maybe I need to be more up front and simply ask what they're looking for before committing to dates. Anyway, I appreciate the feedback."
Why I deleted Tinder,"Some days ago I decided to delete tinder, Ive deleted it plenty of times but this time I hope it's for good. I am still single. This is partially because of me not feeling so good at the moment and having a hard time rejecting people if we dont click. Which leads to me being only half as honest I would like to be with people. And thats important!

But also because of the feeling that dating on tinder feels forced and unnatural. As in not a normal situation to actually meet a partner for the first time. I know lots of people meet eachother online and it probably is a good method, but not for everyone. I went on 5 dates thanks to tinder and I've felt that most of them does'nt seem genuine. It feels like people go on dates just because everyone else is doing it. You ask eachother about work and family and try to decide if they would be a good partner in under a few hours. 

Instead of that I would like to become friends first but that feels difficult on an app such as tinder. I believe meeting friends of friends is a safer bet when wanting to meet someone and getting to know them in a non-forced setting. Sure there are other dating apps, but it's still a strange first encounter for a potential partner, for me at least.

Atm I will focus on being with friends and family, studying and maybe in a while someone interesting will pop up:)  Also, sorry for the rant. It would be interesting to know if anyone else feel the same!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Don't date just because everyone else is doing it, do it because you want to and do it after you feel like you can handle being straight with people. Also, dating feels forced."
My first date since my girlfriend and I broke up stood me up tonight.,"I’ve not been in good shape, and I finally put myself back out there and started talking to this girl. We had plans to go out tonight, and she didn’t show. I feel like shit."
What the actual F is up with dating these days?,"Is it just me or is dating a complete hell these days? No one has any decency or respect. 

These are my dates over the past 3 months:

-go out with a chick. She ends up asking a random guy for coke and says she'll be right back she's going to do a bump in his car. Gets upset when I tell her I'm going home. 

-go on a hike date with a girl. She acts extremely interested then ghosts me 

-make plans to go out with a girl. Cancels. Plans again. Cancels.

-make plans to go out with a girl. Stands me up, Ghosts me. 

-make plans to go out with a girl. Ghosts me. 

-go out with a girl to a gay bar with her friends. Her friends leave. We go to another bar (her suggestion). We get there and she needs to go to the bathroom so I show her where it is. Wait like 10ft from it and I see her walk out of the restroom, immediately leave the bar, and get in a cab. Text her asking where she is and she's like ""I thought you ditched me so I went home""

Dating in 2018 is an absolute disgrace. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who isn't a piece of shit to other people. "
Lost 100% of my trust and respect for my girlfriend [21]after a cruel prank.,"Last week my girlfriend was on a 5 day vacation with her friends, on day 1 she thought it would be a hilarious prank to announce that she is pregnant via text and obviously encouraged all of her friends to play along with it just to wind me up. She told me she was planning to keep the baby, doesn't believe in abortions and all that stuff. When she got back she revealed to me that it was all just a hilarious prank and gave nothing but a half assed apology after I told me how she made me feel over the week.

The first day I was panicking so hard I was vomiting and on the verge of tears, I genuinely thought she was pregnant. Obviously I told my parents and friends because I have absolutely no clue how to deal with what I was going through. By the end of the week I finally come to terms with what was going on and accepted that I might have a child.

She has absolutely no clue why what she did was so terrible, I haven't been able to speak to her since."
"We were never supposed to meet, but it felt like we were destined to meet each other.","TL;DR
I (25M) met a great girl (21F) who happened to have the same school schedule as me and we walked together for a while. We started dating and spent a lot of time together. We expressed interest in each other, almost made it official, but she decided against long distance because she’s transferring to another school. She is a class act and was honest with me about what she was thinking and feeling. It’s hard wondering what might have been.



She (21F) returned to my (25M) university this semester after spending time abroad and is transferring to a school in a neighboring state. We live in the same apartment complex and I noticed that she walked to and from class the same days and times as me. One day I noticed her walking behind me and I slowed down to let her catch up to talk. She called out my name first and that led to several weeks walking and talking together.

I finally asked her out to dinner and I was surprised that she stayed in my car for almost two hours talking with me when I pulled up to her apartment after dinner. Our second date was a movie and she stayed in my car again for over an hour, but had to run in a bit early because she drank too much lemonade. We shared childhood stories, scars, and embarrassing moments over ice cream for our third date.

She told me about her favorite movies and that she hadn’t seen the sixth and final movie yet. I watched 1-5 over the next two days at work and we watched the sixth for our fourth date. I put my arm around her when the movie started and noticed that the tip of her thumb brushed mine a few times. Our fingers overlapped and interlocked as the movie went on. I asked her if she wanted to go stargazing and she immediately agreed.

Two days later I picked her up for our fifth date and found a spot in an open field. We barely missed the sunset, but we didn’t mind. We cozied up and ate snacks while we waited for the sky to turn black and used an app to find constellations. We saw dozens of satellites and wished on shooting stars. She laid her head on my chest and placed her hand over my heart the entire night. “When the Stars Go Blue” by Tim McGraw was playing when I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes, but sighed and said maybe because she is leaving soon. She was reluctant to go into a long distance relationship with such a new romance and wanted time to think, which I completely understand.

At one point I thought I heard her say that she loved me. I took two seconds to consider my feelings for her, and said that I loved her too. I quickly realized I misheard because she said that that was a lot to take in. Instead of backpedaling I said that I think about her, that I care about her, and more than anything I want her to be happy. What else is that except love? She seemed to appreciate my answer because she sighed and held me tighter.

I was not planning to kiss her, but she gradually came closer as the night went on, and soon our eyelashes were brushing. Then our noses nuzzled, and at that moment I knew she wanted to kiss me. I turned to face her and we were drawn to each other like magnets. We made out until 2:30 am and ran from sprinklers twice. We whispered sweet nothings all night, and she told me that she was happy that I treat her special. She confessed that her wish was that we would kiss. She said that she could easily fall asleep in my arms in that field. We agreed to continue seeing each other even though she hadn’t decided on doing long distance, and I assured her that I could go the distance. We kept saying that we had to go but we couldn’t stop kissing each other. We’d just laugh and keep kissing. I fell hard for her that night.

A day or two later I was back at her apartment to watch a movie. I came prepared with a note written in my best cursive, which I haven’t used since third grade, and I folded it into a little boat. I gave it to her after the movie and she loved the gesture. The note said, “Put two ships in the open sea, and, at last, they will come together.” We kissed again for hours and I confessed that she was very special to me, and pretty inside and out. She told me that I was special and amazing for being so good to her. I reminded her again that she could bet on me to go the distance and she said that she believed me.

Our seventh date was the Fourth of July. She wasn’t able to attend a barbecue earlier that day, but I was happy that she came with me to see fireworks. At this point the dread had been setting in for a couple days if it didn’t work, but also the excitement that it just might. We walked around holding hands exploring booths and stopped to listen to a live band. We met up with friends and cozied up for the fireworks. My friends left early to try and beat the crowds but we stayed to wait until everyone had left. We went back to my car because it started to rain and the fireworks continued.

We kissed until we were the last car left. I said that every time I kissed her was like the first time. We drove home holding hands the entire way singing along to every country song on the radio. I pulled up to her apartment at 1:25 am and we kissed goodbye until 3:00 am with the music still playing. She held me tighter than ever before and kissed me slower to stretch fleeting moments into eternity. I got the car door for her and we kissed a while longer in the rain. She didn’t mind because she was wearing my sweatshirt. Every time we kissed I would count to three to let her go, kiss her with each count, but could never let her go on three.

We planned on another movie and lunch the following Saturday but she forgot about homework and a family function. I stopped by her place and tried to talk her into getting a quick lunch, but she suggested another day. We planned on a movie for Monday night and I kissed her goodbye.

She called me Sunday night and asked me to go on a drive. It was either really bad news or really good news, but it felt like the former. Her face said everything when I got into her car. She said that she genuinely enjoyed our time together and appreciated me for being sweet and treating her special, but that the timing was bad because she was leaving in two weeks. She touched my hand and apologized, but I thanked her for her honesty and courage to tell me in person. I reminded her that everything I told her was still true; that she means a lot to me and is very special. I fought back tears but kept my composure until I could go on a drive alone to weep bitterly.

Our time together was brief but it will always be a cherished memory. I meant every word that I told her; that I care about her, and that she is beautiful inside and out. She is a sweetheart and deserves to be treated special. I wish that we could have been together under different circumstances.

This heartbreak hurts differently than the others because we both expressed interest in each other and wanted to be together. It hurts feeling so close to her but being so far. Pure love is selfless so I have resolved to let her go. I had hoped that our ships were destined to meet. I couldn’t help but consider the coincidences that brought us together and I wondered if this was the beginning of our story. It’s unlikely that we will meet again, but I desperately hope from the bottom of my heart that it’s not the end and that life will bring us together at last."
No matter how much I prepare myself for getting ghosted it still hurts a bit,I’ve been ghosted a couple of times and it sucks. The first two times it made me crazy. I kept asking myself what I did wrong. Sent numerous unanswered messages to the “ghoster” and just generally felt horrible. This time though I don’t really care. I haven’t technically been ghosted yet but I can feel it coming. I had already told myself don’t get too attached because they’ll probably ghost you. It sucks knowing that another person doesn’t like me enough to be in a relationship but I understand that I just might not be their type. I wish ghosting wasn’t so common and people would actually tell you why they don’t want to hang out anymore. But it’s just something I had to get used to. I’m not going to lie it still hurts. Just a lot less than the first couple of times.
"The best dating advice, based on my own experiences, that I'd like to share with you all","When I hit 29 last December, I realized I'd be 30 in a year, and took a moment to reflect on where I was in life. I was a little overweight (my weight had always been around 150, but I was closer to 160 I'm pretty sure), out of shape, unhappy with my job, and not particularly happy with my social/romantic life. I felt like I'd hit rock bottom in some ways. Then I decided I wanted to hit 30 the best I could

The first thing I focused on was running and fitness. I'd been running as a hobby for a few years, but this time I started actually following plans and watching what I eat. Whereas I used to run once or twice  a week, I was now running several times. I slowly got into the best shape/physique in my life, and where I was previously content to rank in the top 15 and my age group in races, I was now consistently challenging for the top 3 overall and easily topping my age group

The success from running started spilling over into other parts of life too. I started doing nofap, went on a huge streak of no porn and no masturbation, and felt my confidence go up even more. I started becoming more productive, both at home and at work, and my overall mood was markedly better every day. The highs were higher, and the lows weren't so bad

That's not to say everything was rosy. I injured my knee at the start of the summer and spent two months out and unable to run. This affected my mood and confidence A LOT, and nothing else really seemed to go right during that time frame, including my romantic life. But as soon as I was able to run again, I slowly worked my way back to where I was, and then worked even harder to achieve my goals. To give you some idea: my goal when I hit 29 was to run a 5K in under 20 minutes. I've done that several times over already, and I'm now a little over a month away from turning 30, and my next race will see me run a 5K in under 19

The point of all this, and my advice to you all, is that success begets success. If you can find something you're good at (a sport, a hobby, your job, anything), and work hard to get even better, that success will spill over into other aspects of your life. I've focused on running, which has brought a ton of benefits with it: other than keeping me in top shape, it doubles as a form of meditation. As someone who has struggled (and still occasionally does) with anxiety, running helps relieve a lot of it. It also gives me alone time to focus on my problems and find solutions

I've gotten checked out and have flirted with more girls in the past month than I ever have. I've actually had the confidence to turn down cute girls because I just wasn't interested (the old me wouldn't have done that, because old me would have been desperate). Again, has everything been perfect? Of course not. I asked out a girl this past weekend, only to find out she has a boyfriend. It stung, because I'd thought she was cute for a while and finally got the courage to ask her out. But you know what else? I realized I could either view myself as a guy who got turned down by his crush, or as the guy who won two trophies and top spot at his 5K the very same day

That's success, and confidence, do to you. Every day I tell myself I want to be a champion, and I ask myself, ""What would a champion do in this situation?"". In this specific case, a champion would take the L, keep working hard and improving, and continue winning. This girl didn't work out, so what? If I keep grinding, someone else will see that and appreciate it. But if I give up and let myself fall off, everything will get more difficult. People like others who are successful and confident; they don't like people who lose and are insecure (and note, losing =/= failing. Failing means you made a mistake but got back up to do better. Losing means you gave up)

I'll say it again for you: success breeds success. Find something you enjoy doing, whether it's running, writing, DND, whatever, and get good at it. Then start spreading that success to other areas of your life, and you'll find dating to be easier. It's not a guarantee that you'll be getting dates or you'll find ""the one"", but it is a guarantee that you'll feel better about yourself and will be able to roll with the punches better

I'm sorry this is long, but I hope you enjoyed reading. Feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, or even your own advice you'd like to share"
43 Single Male,"I've been single going on 13 years now, time flies, I was in a 9 year relationship prior to that and a 1 year relationship before that. I've never been on a real date, I just was either in the right place at the right time or a friend introduced me to someone and we hit it off. I no longer have a circle of friends and I feel like I'm going to be single forever. Never married, no kids, I read websites that say I'm a ""red flag"" guy because I've never been married. Honestly it isn't a commitment issue, I was committed in my last relationship and that was 9 years of my life. In this day and age I'm terrified of even approaching a woman. I have little to no confidence when it comes to women, I feel like I don't have anything to offer anyone. I'm not fat, I am missing some teeth but that is from a fear of dentists. I dunno, I'm just an honest guy making my way through life the hard way.

Thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Thanks to all the positive posts.

Edit 2: I get it, I need to get my teeth fixed, I've known for awhile. Thing is I had a traumatic experience with a dentist when I was younger and it isn't just as easy as ""getting my teeth fixed"". I'm terrified of the dentist. "
Does anybody feel like there’s way too many rules when it comes to dating?!,"Sup everyone (28 M) here! I just wanted to get everybody’s opinion on this But does anybody out there feel like there is too many unwritten rules when it comes to dating?!? For example, don’t show interest in someone you like, don’t text back immediately...wait a few days,  Play hard to get, be direct but not too direct, your friends hold a lot of power on your new love interest, no sex until date number 3, stick to gender stereotypes, not accepting a last minute offer and so on and so forth ... like what the hell!?! I know there’s probably more rules out there that I haven’t even touched upon or even know about yet since I feel like there’s a new rule created everyday but this is freaking ridiculous! Who created all these rules and WHY?! literally SUCKS the fun out of dating ..."
It was all a lie [UPDATE] We’re exclusive now!,"https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/be755v/were_exclusive_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

Please see original post for the story on this.

So I (25F) asked him (37M) to be exclusive a little less than two months ago. He said yes and things were great. Over this period of time we’ve texted a lot and made a ton of effort to see each other. We actually just got back from the Hamptons this weekend. 

Well this morning after we had sex he got in the shower and left his phone unlocked. I really didn’t want to look at it but I was honestly a little suspicious but wanted to rest my nerves by hoping to see nothing. But I was wrong. Still on bumble. Texting a few other women. Even was making plans to meet up with one for a drink TONIGHT. My god I was and still am so fucking upset. I know I had to confront him.

So we’re walking to his work and I just hit him with “you know what, I really don’t like being lied to” and he said “about what?” then I said “remember when I asked to be exclusive a month and a half ago and you said yes? Why did you lie?” he then tries to put the blame on me and says “well you asked me that out of nowhere and I felt pressured to say yes” OHHHHH MY GOD what a big load of shit. I told him that if that was the case why didn’t he bring it up AT ALL within the last month and a half. He didn’t really give me an answer and just said he can’t do this right now because he’s late for work. Then I just said “whatever” and walked the fuck away. Haven’t heard from him since. 

He’s just so shocked he got caught being a shitty ass person.

And to everyone who told me in my previous post that I should have been worried, you were so right. Guess I can trust internet strangers more than this guy I’ve been with for ten months."
"Two of the best dates ever, back to back","So I met this guy through matching on tinder on the first day I got the app, and then finding out our parents were friends (my mom had planned to introduce me when I moved!). We shortly moved over to fb messenger after and have been messaging for just over a month.

We finally met on Monday and had a great first date- he actually picked me up to drive me to a job interview and waited in the car while I was at it- then he drove and toured me around the city near where we live (I recently moved to where he lives hence the one month of just messaging), then we went out for a nice lunch. He paid for lunch but I paid for the ice cream after, which was also delicious. After that, we toured around some more before going back to his place and playing video games for a while before my mom asked me to come home for dinner. 

Originally we had plans to play soccer in the evening the next day but he asked if I was down to spend the day with him tomorrow in the city we were going to play soccer in. So he picked me up right in the morning and off we went. We had breakfast and lunch together, went shopping, even met his grandma and toured around the city a bit with her. He also took me to an arcade which was fun too! We went back to his house and played more video games before heading out to play soccer, and then he drove me home in the evening. 
It was two of the best dates I have ever had! I was beaming all day! He even texted me after to say he had a great time too ☺️

We have some set plans for next week too and I’m really looking forward to seeing him again. I’m quite new to tinder so not really sure how to progress from here, but I think we both get the sense that each other is interested in the other."
I (25m) seem to only attract girls with anxiety/depression and it kind of weirds me out.,"I've been in a few relationships before (all lasting a few months, all fun, and all ended by circumstances outside my control). They've all been great, I've learned a lot about dating and about myself, but (and I know this is shallow)- every girl I've dated has a history of anxiety and/or depression that began before I met them, and which I've found out about AFTER we start dating. 

&#x200B;

I know that I'm a confident, empathetic person who gives a lot in relationships and is comfortable with vulnerability, but it seems like the only people who are attracted to me are women looking for that emotional stability, who then latch onto me right away. I don't regret any of my past relationships, and I enjoy being an emotional rock. However, I feel guilty when I share my own problems or concerns with my dating partners because I feel like its unfair to make them listen to/help me with my problems when they have so much else they're worried about. I've genuinely cared about and trusted the women I've dated, but I sometimes find myself holding back, if that makes sense. Now I'm a PhD student and I have an insanely busy schedule, so I can't give as much as I'm used to, which makes me worried about dating someone with anxiety. 

&#x200B;

Have you noticed differences when you were dating people with and without anxiety? What were those differences? Were those relationships equally satisfying- am I missing out on something in my relationships? I guess I just need advice on how to handle this moving forward. Do I need to change how I portray myself online/in real life?"
Feeling like his second choice,"My boyfriend (22M) has an attractive female friend who he “loves” and will post “my fav” with her on his stories. He swears they’re just friends ever since (get this) they met on Tinder and she said she was just looking for friends. 

I (20F) think I already know I need to end things, we’ve only been together for a couple of weeks, and I just feel like a second choice to him. I’d rather not waste my energy and affection if I’m just a filler person to him, and to me he’s not. Am I right to feel this way? And how do I stop myself from texting him when I miss what we did have?

Edit: I’m alright looking, somebody once told me I look like fruitypoppin which is a rly nice compliment/if you want ref haha

Edit 2: I also met him on Tinder and he met her on there before he met me, so he wasn’t on there while he was with me :)"
Today I (27F) asked someone out for the first time in years! It was terrifying.,"I dont know if I should put this here or if anyone will read it, but here it goes..

Back story: My ex and I dated on and off for 5 years. We had a cute start-up story. We both worked in a King Soopers. I was his barista and he was my banker. I asked HIM out on a date. (Trophy points for me). I loved him with everything I had and he was my world. He was my first real love and I cared for him deeper than I ever cared for anyone. Throughout our relationship, I chose not to see how he was mentally and emotionally abusive to me so much so that I completely lost my confidence and who I was as a person. Manipulation really puts a toll on the soul. He officially left me 2 months ago leaving me feeling like everything was my fault while I was already going through a very dark time in my life. 

Present tense: I have been seeing a therapist to try to understand who I am without him. My therapist and I have been very proud of my progress and I found my fire again! Yay me! 
Today I walked up to someone that I've been flirting with and found extremely attractive. We seem to click well and I needed to see where this would lead. I was terrified. Rejection is one of my biggest fears. Despite this, I walked right up to him and asked him out (shaking but tried to portray confidence)... verdict is, he said, ""of course"". 

People of Reddit: Ask him/her out! Take the leap. Find that courage. Remember you are worth alot, and if the other person cant see that, it's alright! As long as you see it and the good ones will see it too. Good luck in the dating world! It can be challenging, but it is only a part of life and should never define you. :)"
How much do looks actually matter for guys in reality?,Open to any and all perspectives and viewpoints on this
How to date when you’re painfully shy?,I know most people want to date someone who is attractive and has a good personality. I think I’m attractive. People tell me that I’m pretty. But I’m super shy. I have a good personality when people get to know me but it takes a long time for me to feel comfortable to let my true personality show. Most people give up on me before that time comes. I really hate it because I like myself and I know people will like me but I can’t stop thinking that people will think I’m weird. I know it’s a problem and I want to fix it. Does anyone have any tips for a shy person?
I was given flowers by a woman!,"So this girl and I had agreed to go out, Since I’m barely getting to know her I decided to take her to the Natural History Museum because she likes dinosaurs/paleontology. I don’t have a car, so she came to pick me up and suddenly she pulls out a bouquet of roses and says “these are for you.” I was in complete shock because I’ve never heard of a woman giving a guy roses, much less did I expect this to happen to me. She then added “can’t a woman give flowers to a guy.” I said “yeah...” Now my questions are have any of you guys received flowers from a woman?  
If so, what does this mean? I even googled these questions and I couldn’t find an answer. Just for context, she considers herself a feminist and as the day went on she kept emphasizing about “changing gender roles.”, “patriarchy” and, being a simple woman...."
"People of Reddit, Tell me the lamest lie a potential love interest tried telling you.","Here is mine

Met a guy off Pof.com (avoid this site if it still exists) talked for a few weeks and hung out a few times before a big date. Now I felt this guy was a little off but I thought it was me being an asshole because I totally can be anyways he would want to come to my house to hang out but he never would want to hang at his house that he paid for because his grandparents didn't like strangers. I also lived with my grandparents at the time so I just figured hey old peeps set in their ways. 
Fast forward to a week before our big date, now before I go on a real date, I try to get to know everything about the person online first so we chatted about everything our current lives, our pasts, what we want in the future etc so I thought i had gotten to know him pretty well
Hahaha since you are still reading,  you know damn well that's not that case so one night I go out to dinner at home town buffet with my grandparents and I see him and of course Im happy to see him and say hey....well the guy pales...I mean goes ghost white and wide-eyed like I was Pennywise from It, being confused as hell I take off my hat and tell him hey its me and he just slightly waves and takes off the in other direction

And sits down with a woman and a little boy the spitting image of him. Humiliated, I hurriedly finish my meal as my grandfather is telling me how ashamed I should be as if I should have somehow known. 

An hour later, I get a text saying ""Hey baby, I heard you met my twin""

This is why I feel some people go all FBI with a new love interest. 

TD;LR Potential love interest and me ran into each other at hometown buffet while he was there with his wife and kid and later tried telling me it was his twin. Never mentioned twin at all."
Dating App idea!,"My idea for a dating app (pardon if this is dumb but I'm bored and drinking). You basically log in, create an account and then have to decide if you're looking for something casual or serious right at the start. This creates two separate groups of people and can only be switched by requesting which requires the user to fill out a form. This I think will make the process of switching tedious enough to stop people from toggling back in forth to take advantage of both groups.

Anyways, the profile has required fields. These fields include things such as a 3 picture minimum (at least 2/3 has to be ONLY you and you have to be visible), age, height, gender, career, education and two text boxes - one for a brief introduction and then the second for hobbies/interests. These text boxes will have a minimum requirement.

Here's where I think it gets unique. All conversation is live. You must both be online at the same time to chat. You only see users online at the time you are and these users are in the form of little icons you can click on to view. You basically go through and mark yes or no that you would like to talk to them and it will mark any users that want to talk to you in green on your screen so you know! If you match with them then you both get a notification saying that you want to talk to each other. Once you mark someone as a no they will disappear from your list so you can't see that they are online but you can go to another screen that let's you see everyone you've said no to and basically check any you want to undo.

If you both say yes to the notification to talk, you're brought into a chat room where you get questions based on if you're looking for something casual or serious. It is a specific number of questions like maybe 5-10 and it changes each time. Then you just share your answers and at the end you get to choose if you'd like to keep talking to them. If at any point you decide you aren't fond of the person you can exit the chat and then they get sent to your ""rejected"" group unless you go uncheck them. If you make it through though and both want to keep talking than you get your own chat where you don't have to be on at the same time and can exchange numbers/meet up or whatever."
Realizing you're the problem,"Hey r/dating. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this rant.

I haven't had a second date in six months. I'm a somewhat conventionally attractive woman, take care of myself, etc. and on dating apps, I get tons of matches pretty easily, and even sometimes in public or when I'm out with my friends, I'm approached and asked for my number. However, it's after someone meets me in person for a date that things tend to go south and I get politely rejected or ghosted.

The pattern tends to go as follows; I match with someone, they seem super interested, we talk for a couple days on the app or via text, one of us asks to meet up in person (I like to take the initiative sometimes and am fairy confident), the date goes okay/good in my opinion, but then I either never hear from them again, or when I try to reach out, I get a polite message indicating they are not interested in seeing me again.

And if this clarifies, some of them I slept with after, some I didn't. 

So, I've come to the conclusion that while I consider myself attractive and have no issues getting interest/matches from people, I have some seriously blaring personality flaws that are really turning the people I'm going out with off. After the same exact pattern happening so many times, it's pretty clear that I am the problem.

I think for one I talk about myself too much, I know that for sure. And I have a tendency to overshare. And maybe I'm not asking my dates enough questions. Or, maybe I'm drinking too much on the dates bars. Or maybe I look better in my pictures than in real life?  I'm trying to figure it out and work on it so I can be better at dating and finally get past the first date.

Anyway, rant over. I guess I'm glad I'm self aware enough to see the pattern, but it still sucks to be rejected so many times and feel like there's something seriously wrong with me. I have tons of friends I'm close with and I get along with my coworkers, but for whatever reason I guess I'm not bringing the qualities that make me likable in other situations into my dates.

Thanks for reading."
What the hell do you do when they get their guitar out?,"This might sound like a niche question but I'm guessing I'm not the only person this has happened to. I was on a date recently and ended up back at the guy's house, whereupon he (unprompted) got out his guitar and started strumming his heart out to Elliott Smith's back catalogue. My question is very simple - what, as the (involuntary) audience are you supposed to do in that situation? Gaze at them adoringly? Try and join in? Bosh out some impromptu interpretive dance moves? Genuinely, what is the appropriate response? (I'd like to add that, whilst I absolutely do not want to be sexist here, I feel like the ladies may relate to this more than the fellas. Happy to be proved wrong though, obviously)"
I did it,"I finally managed to ask my crush out. And she revealed to me she got a boyfriend. I took it rather well and kept my cool during the whole thing.

While I am disappointed a little that my crush loves someone else, I'm proud of myself for finally getting the balls to at least ask. Proud that I finally told my crush how I felt after two years. Proud that now that I've asked a girl out for the first time, then what's gonna stop me from asking out someone else? 

I'm so proud of myself for finally saying something. It goes to show that if a socially awkward guy like me can do it, so can you! 

Thank you guys for listening.

"
(Kinda Gross) I'm pretty sure I love this guy,"For context, I just got my new car this December.

My boyfriend and I decided to try out this new restaurant in town. It was a nice little lunch, we talked and whatnot, normal sort of stuff. When we were getting ready to leave, and he asked me to drive home since he felt nauseous. I went ahead and drove him back to his house. So, we're almost there, and then it happens... He vomits in my car, and looks up at me and starts crying. Honestly, I couldn't help but laugh. He looks at me with this sort of bewildered look in his eye, surprised I'm not screaming at him or throwing a fit for making such a mess. I finally break my chuckling with, ""I can't believe you beat Fergus (his boxer that's notorious for throwing up) to it!"" I get out of my seat to help him sit down (this all happened behind a coffee shop by his house) and went to go get him water and some paper towels. The baristas were really good sports, offering me a whole roll of towels and a couple of cups of water. He helped me clean it up without question, and I sat with him on the curbside to make sure he was ok, even calling him after he got home to make sure he was alright. I don't think I'd do that for anyone else, and I really do hope this relationship goes on for even longer."
"When someone shows you who they are the first time, believe them","There will  come a time when you've  learned that people are who they are. Never change, but become better versions of themselves. For better or for worst.

We  whether  men or women make the error  of acting like we know someone better than they know themselves. This leads to us expecting that by tomorrow, she'll treat me better or maybe he just  had a bad day and its going to get better tomorrow.  Only issue  is the fact that its been 2 years and one day turns into 24 months.

We're  all guilty  of this and we all fall into the trap of falling for the idea of someone rather than the actuality. It is this idea of fantasy that leaves us broken with time wasted and regret. 

Everyone in life has to learn and teach all in the split second. Some for better or for worse.  When they leave and they did you wrong dont fall for it. They'll  do it again. When you're  in a dead end relationship  don't  act like one good meal or a night of sex will make it better.
When you're  on a date and you feel that he or she want you gone dont chase them.

This is one step into realizing self worth and moving onto better people in your path. "
"PSA: I've seen this common catchphrase a lot ""You need to trust your partner"" and it needs addressing. You should trust but you should also verify!","A lot of folks seem to have this reinforced belief that you should maintain a constant level of trust for your partner even if they are acting in ways that don't elicit trust within the relationship. Trusting blindly is the worst thing that someone can do and when folk say ""you need to trust them"" they are effectively saying ""you need to trust them even if your concerns are justified and if they break your trust, so be it"". STOP giving this crap advice to people in relationships. It leads them into believing that they should not be worried and that what is causing them to be concerned will just fix itself. Reality doesn't work that way. In any relationship, not just marital ones, it may very well take the actions of one party to save the other party from themselves and from external threats, so that the relationship itself can be preserved. 

Tl;Dr the advice ""you need to trust your partner"" is common word salad that isn't helping relationships. People in relationships should trust but they should also verify. Take action and don't expect things to just work themselves out."
Some people are trash at communication,"I’m a really straightforward and upfront person. If I like you, I’ll let you know and offer my number. If I’m no longer interested in dating you I’ll tell you so. 

There’s this guy I met a few months back that I’d see almost daily. We’d chat and we got to know each other. I thought “hey I like this guy” so I asked him if I could give him my number. He said yes. We texted for a bit and then a few days later he stops texting me and I don’t see him around. Over a week and a half later he pops up out of nowhere and sends me a text. 

Also this past Friday I was supposed to go on a date with some other guy and he didn’t follow through because “he got distracted by his friends”. I told him it was okay and that if he doesn’t want to go on a date that it is fine but also tell me what you want. I got no response.

I know these are minor things and it’s not a big issue. It’s just frustrating when I hear all the time that guys appreciate an upfront girl but whenever I’m upfront with guys I feel like I scare them away. 

I talked to a friend about this and he said it might be because I’m intimidating, but I’m a tiny gal. I feel like I don’t look that intimidating.  

Not sure where I’m going with this post, I’m just frustrated about getting stuck dealing with people that can’t communicate."
Online Dating Isn't Really Dating,"A common theme I seem to see on here is almost every single person bemoaning their lack of success in dating with posts that start with ""we matched on [app name]"". That no matter how long they spend on these apps or how many times they tweak their profile or opener that they can't seem to connect with anyone in a meaningful way. Here's why.

Online dating (apps, sites) isn't really dating. It's really just a way to set up meetings between people. Your profile, at the end of the day, is more like a marketing brochure than an actual representation of who you are. Without developing the skills needed to be emotionally in tune with others (particularly strangers), you will find yourself consistently struggling to attract people into your life long term. How does one develop those skills?

By engaging in social activities that create regular social circles where there are people who consistently show up and new people constantly rotating in. Learning how to make friends with strangers is the first step, learning how to gauge signs of interest through invitations and physical escalation rounds out the process. 

Spend less time working on your profile and more time working on your relationships with real humans, and your dating pool and options will flourish. "
Worst date I’ve been on lol,"Met this girl I remember from high school on tinder we agreed on a date, long story short we agree to go to a gig together seeing as she’s training to be an event manager. On the day I get there she introduces me to the band and half the people at the gig seems friendly and everyone welcomes me.  We get to the dance floor the musics kicking and I’m feeling like this could be a great night, I’m dancing beside her smiling laughing at her jokes then she introduces me to her boyfriend. I put on a fake smile and shake this dudes hand. He puts his arm round her and she gives me the f*ck me eyes. I do the math in my head and realise the situation and I remind myself that I am not that type of guy and covertly commit an Irish goodbye to this gig ( an Irish goodbye is leaving without saying anything) and bomb it the f*ck out of the bar. Lesson of the story always ask if the girl your talking to is single just for safety."
"Online dating sucks for everyone, not just guys","I see a lot of posts on here about how online dating is not for guys and only girls have any luck finding a lot of dates. 

I (24F) go through weeks where I might get one match, maybe two if it's close to a holiday.  An issue I have with matches is guys not messaging for days at a time, then saying sorry, I was busy for ""x"" reason. Also, most of the messages I receive are guys ""complimenting"" my body and messaging inappropriate or unwanted sexual advances without any provocation. 

For every good date I actually have, there are 5 that are horrible... I'm not talking about no chemistry or had a difficult time conversing, I'm talking about comments that make me cringe and shutter or inappropriate touching. 

So, next time you're frustrated about not getting matches, please remember, this sucks for everyone. 

EDIT: I am not saying that it sucks the same way for everyone. Men and woman may or may not have different challenges with online dating. This was a vent directed towards people who think if you are even a remotely attractive woman, online dating is an all you can eat buffet. Online dating sucks for everyone in one way or another. 

Thank you to those that gave actual advice and showed concern. You're the real MVPs. "
"To my fellow black women who have ever felt like they are the ""bottom of the pile,"" you are electric.","I get legitimately sad whenever I see or talk to other black women who detail their experiences with dating as extremely negative. I get sad when they mention how their experiences have them internalizing negative notions about their skin color, hair, body, intelligence, etc.

To my fellow black/dark-skinned women, you are electric.

Reclaim your self-image. 

Reclaim your confidence. 

Don't let this asinine world of dating be the final determinant in how you see yourself and all that you have to give. 

You are smart, clever, and any other positive attribute that you've wanted to claim for yourself against naysayers.

And you're worthy of a relationship that is just as electric as you are.

(as is everyone, but this post is for the black girls)"
"Yeah just experienced one of those ""met through tinder"" relationships.","Should've seen it coming.

Met this girl on tinder and met up a bit. Talked for couple weeks and Been dating for a month and a half until Found out she was talking to other guys at the time but she ""choose me"" as the winner. She made us exclusive when she told me she caught feelings for me and made her feel like no other guy has made her feel.  Just from getting to know her and her history with how she would be afraid to commit should've raised a flag. There were plenty flags showing that maybe she wasn't mentally ready to commit. Examples include her not opening up to me about certain things, not talking to me for couple days, being afraid when I recorded her and us getting food and putting it on the Instagram story 

Today, while i spent the night at her house, just silence a feeling of uncomfortable feeling like I wasn't wanted there. The next morning rolls by and I ask her after a hour of her not really paying attention to me, if she was not interested anymore. And she tried to act real cutesy and shy which was really annoying saying ""i realize I don't want anyone in my personal space after today and I'm not ready for relationship"" and I ask if she even has feelings for me as I see her face is unfazed. "" I think that I thought I had feelings, but... "". Bruh. I got up and just left. Definitely be wary of tinder dates. Because I wasn't .

Edit: the thing that suckered me in was that she used the fat L word on me and I thought she truly was feeling some typa way. After all that talk about how she loved me and how I'm the one for her, it never was put into action. And I felt that .



Sorry for the rant."
Am I a dick for thinking like this....,"So I'm(24m) sort of seeing this girl(19f) and I like her, I get along with her and I really enjoy spending time with her, but she's a bigger girl, I have dated bigger girls in the past but they where always working on themselves at the same time.
I do want to say I am sexualy attracted to her in the sense of what she does and can do and I'm emotionally attracted to her but I'm only a little physically attractived to her, I have said that we should go for a walk when I'm with her so we can get out of the house and walk her dog. Am I seeming like I'm not happy with her weight by suggesting to do some activitys outside or is it fine to suggest it. Is this normal with some couples out there?"
Is smoking a dealbreaker for you? Why?,"I [27F] just started dating this guy [28M] that I really like. The conversation is great, the chemistry is incredible, he’s a gentleman, etc. However I just found out he smokes. 

Typically smoking is a dealbreaker for me because I find it gross and it’s detrimental to your health, but I find myself rethinking this with him. 

Am I being closed minded? Or is it worth dropping something potentially amazing?

Update: he brought it up last night in a conversation about our intentions in the relationship. He told me he vapes cbd for anxiety and pain. So I’ll do some research, but we’re giving it a go!"
GF of 7 years (24F) vicariously lives through YouTube couple vlogs,"So as mentioned in the title, my girlfriend of 7 years vicariously lives through these YouTube couples she watches daily, for hours. It was never a problem before until she started to juxtapose our relationship to theirs. She compares how I treat her to how the couples treat each other in their vlogs. Whenever we get into arguments, she’ll just walk away and binge watch these couples for hours. I feel like these couples promote a idealized relationship that is seriously impossible to maintain in reality, but my gf tries to hold me to those standards when she herself doesn’t even do it and it honestly feels like it’s killing our relationship. I haven’t talked to her about because all she does is tell me how bad I treat I her. Man I’m really trying to make this work but it makes me feel incompetent as fuck. I feel like I’m just not good enough for what she expects anymore."
You're good enough,"I just realised how silly I sounded the other day, I have started dating someone new and the other day I was thinking why wouldn't he just leave and find someone better and why does he think I'm good enough to date.

But we all have something to offer and things that make us unique and great as people. I have new hobbies which I'm interested in, I love my family and friends a lot, I have a good job which I like to work hard at and I'm passionate about certain projects that help people.

It was so stupid to think I might not be enough, how much more does someone have to be? We are all humans and make mistakes, but most of us do genuinely want to do the right thing and if you're not good enough for someone perhaps they're just trying to get the unattainable and it's not on you.

So unapologetically be yourself and someone will truly love you for it because what is love worth if they only love a persona or idea of you? What's the point in that?

UPDATE: This post is not at all to discourage self-improvement, if you are not happy where you are, then always keep improving and strive to be where you want to be. However just don't be so hard on yourself while dating and act like the other person is on a pedestal and you're not good enough, they're dating you for a reason and if it doesn't work out then your value as a person isn't lowered. "
So do people go on dates anymore?,"I mean like damn, people asking for a date is like offending everyone's great great ancestors. New flash- dating is supposed to be fun! I feel like this generation is so scared of commitment, they cannot even go on one or two dates.  
What im saying is, in 2019, lets bring back dating. Its OKAY to ask someone on a date. Its okay to reject- to say ""hey Im not feeling it, I wish you the best though"" instead of ghosting. In 2019, Lets bring back dating 👍. Anyone else agree?

Breaking someone’s heart sucks.,"Ugh.  Dated a guy for three weeks. On paper he is perfect.  Everything I hoped for.   We have fun together, he makes me feel special, desirable and loved.  The problem? I am not attracted to him physically.  I had to end it tonight.   While it would have been easy to drag it out and have someone, it wasn’t fair to him.  

 It was awful.   Dating sucks.  "
"Women, how do you feel about dating a working class man in a skilled trade rather than a professional?","I have a bachelor's degree, but I've found it to be not worth the paper it was written on. I tried to self learn coding, but it's very difficult to get a job that way it seems. I've spent years trying to get some sort of professional job, in part because I feel like professional jobs just have more social cachet and there is a stigma associated with working class jobs, even though many of them actually pay better than lower end white collar jobs. (and I think there are factual data points that back this up)

Anyways now that I've accepted my station as working class I've started an apprenticeship program and I should be making pretty solid money in a few months, maybe someday own my own company."
I'm trying to keep my dating standards low but it's hard and I'm getting frustrated.,"In short, I believe that a man shouldn't be valued based on how much money he brings to the table but what is in his heart. I have tried to get involved with a high school dropout who was disrespectful to me after I tried to force myself to believe that I'm doing a good thing by trying to be friends with someone who regularly puts me down and disrespects me. Everytime I try to date or become close with guys who are poor, broke and didn't graduate high school it never works out and they offer me little to nothing. People generally say don't be shallow and give a man a chance if you really love him but in my experiences it never worked out. I'm honestly just thinking screw this I'm done I'll just find a freaking rich man"
Do guys like it when it when girls pay / are assertive?,"I'm going on a date and I kinda want to switch things up, but I'm not sure how he'll act?

My ex is dating again, so I guess I've stopped feeling this guilt and I'm going to give it a try too. My friends have set me up on multiple dates after my breakup (before I was ready to date) and this is my first time being asked out by someone on their own terms!

He seems kind of prideful, but I kinda want to catch him off guard. I've gone out with him before as friends, but this is the first time we're labeling it as a date. But yeah I want to pay for the first date and plan it, which is exciting for me because I've been becoming more assertive recently and its very empowering. Do you guys think he would like that or will he be scared away by it? i don't want to come on too strong :-(

Edit: He's asked me out multiple times before and I'm finally giving it a shot, but I'm not sure what his expectations are"
Am I the only one who likes to know someone before sex?,"22M here, I feel weird and alienated from my peers cause I actually like to feel a personal attraction to someone before jumping in the sack with them, not just a physical one. In fact most of the time my body won’t get revved up until I feel safe and trust my partner. My bar for attraction is pretty high too, I like partners who are smart, ambitious, talented, philosophical, etc. which makes it hard to start relationships when most people I know are more appearance/“sex appeal” oriented in their relationships.

"Stood up Again, Screw online dating.","I (F24)have been stood up the 4th time in like, 30 days. I don't understand why this happening. These guys are LITERALLY scheduling dates, confirming on the day of, and then just not showing up at the place they chose at the time they suggested! I would respect them more if they said the day before, ""i'm not into you, i dont want to go"" then them letting me do my hair, which takes 4 hours to do because I am black and I have very long hair, doing my makeup, which takes an hour, choosing an outfit, shaving my legs, driving to your suggested location, and then finding out that you aren't coming. Like, this dude unmatched my profile when i asked what his ETA was after i was there for 1/2 an hour waiting!!!

Better yet, dont even ask me on a date! Dont confirm a place and time, dont play with me as a person! Dont make me waste my hair products, makeup, gas, money, energy, time, and self-confidence. 

I have so much anxiety when i date because at this point, its a 50/50 chance that they will even show up. i'm so done at this point. LA is the worst place to date. I'm done. It's not worth it at this point."
Being stood up can actually save the night!,"I (31M) have been stood up tonight - the person I was suppose to be seeing never showed up. Second time this has happened in the last six months! On both occasions, however, being stood up was a blessing. On the first one, the venue was showing an NFL match (quite rare in London). At present, I have an opportunity to enjoy good food and good wine on my own, without having an awkward conversation. Dating still sucks, but looking at the bright side! "
We had our first kiss after the 5th date,And it was everything and more than I expected. I am soooo happy!
Dating in your 30's in 2018 is rough. Keep your heads up.,"It's almost comedic at this point, really. You can literally have everything going for you and get absolutely nowhere these days with dating and I think a lot of it has to do with the apps. They're successful precisely because they don't work most of the time, and are specifically designed to keep you on them so they can monetize off your frustration. They're making everyone flaky, indecisive, and non-committal due to the illusion of choice, but they're not entirely to blame, and thats the remaining piece of the puzzle I'm trying to figure out - do I have a character flaw I'm unaware of? If so, nobody has given me any insight as to what it is..

I have never had a problem with women my entire life before my last LTR ended in the beginning of 2016, and I have WAY more to offer now than I ever did in the past. When I got out of that relationship apps were the go-to and I've only had intermittent success with them since. Here's the typical pattern for me; Match with someone, meetup, things appear to be going well, then we talk for 2-3 weeks, possibly meetup a second time etc and then....crickets, OR they convey that there's no 'spark' or aren't 'feeling it'. I'm sure that may be partially true, but not the entire reason for them losing interest. It's just crazy how everyone is trying to judge or replace you before they even give themselves a chance to get to know you, but I guess these are the rules that are in place in the throw-away society we now live in.

This is going to sound like a humble brag but its just me being objective about my situation - I'm a handsome guy (so I'm told) I workout regularly, have a great career making DAMN good money, good credit, a house, a dog. I've got my life together. I'm respectful, educated, driven, introspective, multifaceted, emotionally relevant, not clingy, and I take care of myself.  I've got a satirical / nihilistic sense of humor and I'm decently witty, but I'm also kind of chill and introverted. I've dated, been in LTRs, and FWB type situations with drop dead gorgeous women so I know what I'm capable of, but man it's just been really confusing lately as to why I'm not having any luck. I recently started dating women with kids which I no longer see an issue with given my age, but no luck with them either....what. is. happening?

Anyway, more of a rant than me looking for advice I suppose. None of this matters, we're all just ghosts driving meat-coated skeletons flying through the universe with no inherent purpose. Don't take anything too seriously guys. Merry Fucking Christmas."
I ended it last night,"I (23F) ended it with the guy (23M) I was seeing for 4ish months last night. He sent a text out of no where asking to slow things down and I told him to call me. We talked for 40 minutes. He wanted to let it organically become a more serious relationship. He thought I was pushing for something serious too fast. In reality I knew we could never be a serious thing, so I was giving him what I thought he wanted. He was definitely confused, as I kept insisting we never had a chance at being serious. He would repeat ""never say never"" and I would respond with ""no, you don't understand it can't work."" I ended it with goodnight and goodbye.

I thought I could date just anyone. I thought it didn't matter if he didn't have his life together (we are 23 who has their life together?), but it was more than that. He wasn't motivated by anything and had no passion in life. He hated his job (bartending) and kept talking about all these crazy next steps. I tried helping him and I wanted to give advice but, I'm in a very different place.

I have my bachelors. I'm currently finishing up my masters degree. I'm looking for PhD programs for the next 4 years... I was stringing him along because I was having fun but I knew that his directionless life was a major red flag for me. I want something serious, but I (edit: realized I) didn't want anything serious with him.

\^\^(Edit: these were the realizations I made after the fact. Not things I was purposely doing. **I didn't purposely string him along because I wanted fun. I thought I really wanted to be with him.** But once we talked it out i became aware what i was doing and the harm it would cause if continued).

This was an interesting dating experience for me and I learned a lot about what I want. I don't really know what to say now. I'm kind of sad it's over. So I posted here.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Love the comments its entertaining me. I would just like to add I am a hopeless romantic 23 year old who didn't think a difference in schedules, lifestyles, and goals would have an effect on a relationship whatsoever. It wasn't feasible and I recognized that but clung because romance?

**9:24 am:** *I'm responding to things instead of studying because I'm honestly intrigued by the conversations going on. There is a lot about the relationship I am leaving out. The ""boo boo me I'm better than him but I'm having fun so im going to keep going along with this""  was never my intention. Guess what? We met on tinder. What do 20 year olds use tinder for? There is a weird thing that happens when you start the relationship with sex.... do we actually like each other or is this just fun. We go to know each other and we liked what we saw. but we also liked the sex. so when it gets to the point of continuing or ending, shit like this usually ends. For me, it just turned out it was just the sex. We went on a  handful of dates  over the 4 months. I could barely call it dating and it hurt. I cared for him and I wanted to help him move ahead, but i didnt want to mother him at the same time. Imagine trying to ""date"" someone and never going on dates and just going to his house to have sex and talk about life. im not claiming to be mature. im 23. this was the most real ""relationship"" i've ever had and it still ended. my point was i am trying to get my shit together and move ahead in life and what he was doing confused me. im not looking for some doctor/lawyer/superman, im just looking for someone who is career driven like me.*"
Opinion: We're facing a generation of singles,"Presenting my points as to why in the next decades, I believe that more and more people in the current young generation born 1990-2000+ will be single and unmarried in their 40s and 30s:

1. **Overchoice:** Scratching the 8 billion humans mark, you can just pull out tinder and get a pool of choices, compare and pick from any of them. There's just so many! Overchoice tricks us into not compromising. There's so much of 'the good stuff', *surely* you don't need to sacrifice your requirements, and there's always more fish in the sea, no bother fighting for a relationship!
2. **Social Media and Porn:** I've put these two in the same category. They both distort our view of potential partners, and over-sexualise our ideas of relationships. Important as well, they higher our standards. Your girl next door is neither an instagram model, or just your sweet sexual release. And a relationship is much more than something sexual, sexual attraction or infatuation, but we don't seem to think so these days.
3. **Mental Health:** This comes in with less force than the first two, but it also holds some weight to it. We are all notoriously depressed, it's a XXI century thing at this point. Instant gratification, addictions (to food, to social media, to youtube), porn, technology... they can be no good. But for whatever reasons you want, our declining mental health as a society is complicating relationships, turning them unhealthy and painful.

And for the above reasons, I believe our generation is doing quite a crappy job at dating, and many will enter their 30s quite single as a  △ . Please feel free to point out where you think I'm mistaken! happy to be wrong and change my mind(or try to be open minded, at least)!"
"I genuinely don’t understand what I’m missing with online dating, I’m completely inept","I’ve been on Reddit for a minute, I know *all* the classic responses to people saying they need help on their tinder/bumble profiles. I have a variety of photos that at least I think look good and show off my personality. I used to have a good bio that showed off what my interests are and gave a lot of points for someone to start a conversation with. Then I had people tell me I put too much in my bio and it should be short and succinct - fine, I’ve done that. I try to show genuine interest when I get a match, because I hate it when I talk to someone with the personality of a plank. I try to move things along to a physical date as soon as possible but then things fizzle out. I used to live in a really small town so I’ve moved to Chicago since then, partially for a larger dating pool but mostly to advance my own interests. 

I thought things would be better since I moved, considering it has like 200x the population density. But I hardly get any matches, maybe one a week, and on bumble only one person of 5 has actually sent a message so I couldn’t even talk to 4 of them. And when I do get a match most of the time they seem so bored and disinterested.

I want to date people I meet in real life but I do *not* want to be seen as a creep. All I ever hear are women saying they get approached too often. I don’t want to disturb anyone at a cafe or something, especially if they have headphones in. At bars, nearly all women are with friends and I tend to go alone, and so that’s a no-go. 

I’m starting improv classes soon so I’m hoping that will help, but still I feel like I’m missing out on a lot in life, and I get so frustrated when people talk about how easy it was for them to find a SO or how many dates they go on. Like, how?!

Sorry, that was a lot of word salad but I had to get that off my chest

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the helpful advice! This community is so supportive"
It happened again,"Met a girl on tinder, i usually get their snapchat before i meet to verify who they are but i skipped it this time because i asked her if she wanted to come over on my 5th message and she was down, needless to say she looked nothing like her photos. It was the same person but they looked nothing alike, fuck anybody that pulls this shit, this is the third fucking time. I was pretty nice to the first two but this time i just opened the door and saw i was fucking bamboozled so i closed it."
I fucking hate what apps like tinder have done to the world of dating,"\[23/m\] words cannot express how deep my hatred is for tinder (or any swipe dating apps), and online dating in general. it has significantly damaged my mental health, and there’s no end in sight.

&#x200B;

1. it puts average looking men at a severe disadvantage. I’ve spent so much time and effort into tinder and bumble, getting the perfect pictures, sending a ton of messages, swiping right on everyone, etc. fucking nothing. it’s wrecked my self esteem, and it makes me resent those who effortlessly match with dozens of people
2. if you’re and awkward texter, you’re completely fucked. there’s an immense amount of pressure to be charming, funny, etc etc when you start texting your match, and if you’re not, you’ll never get anywhere.
3. it’s allowed women to not have to even set foot out of their homes to find tons of men to date. that’s taken away the impetus for many women to actually go out and meet men in real life.

&#x200B;

I moved to a new city about 6 months ago. I’ve wanted a relationship desperately since I’ve been here, and I’ve tried it all. I’ve spent months swiping on tinder and bumble. total failure. I’ve tried approaching girls whenever I’m out and about, got lots of numbers, but in the end that was a total failure too.

&#x200B;

I also spend a substantial amount of time going to MeetUp events to meet girls. I try to put myself out there and meet as many people as possible, in the hopes that one day I will come across a nice girl who I can pursue. as it turns out, the gender ratio at the vast majority of these events is about 75 men 25 women, and of those women, maybe half are my age.

&#x200B;

to me, it seems that the age of online dating has made the dating world as a whole more isolating and emotionally crushing for average looking men. I’m so fucking frustrated sexually and emotionally I have a hard time thinking straight sometimes. I don’t have money, so those singles meetups in bars are out of reach for me. anything that costs money is out of the question.

&#x200B;

and yet here I am, back on tinder and bumble. why? because apparently that’s one of the only fucking ways to meet girls. I hate it, but I feel like I don’t have a choice.

&#x200B;

how do the other average looking men in this sub deal with this?"
How can i improve my text game?,"I'm a confident \[21yo\] guy, have hobbies, decently attractive, and am somewhat experienced in relationships (2 year relationship, 3 other 2-6 month ones)  but i can't seem to figure out text game. Texting just doesn't feel natural to me and i'm much more comfortable just talking on the phone or in person. Problem is, with online dating you have to actually get the person's attention and attraction to get to that point. I always try to be unique with my opening lines and almost always get responses. The conversation tends to go stale quickly though. It just doesn't feel like it flows. I ask questions about themselves to keep it going, only use genuine compliments,  try to find common interests, etc.. I've gotten the snapchat of basically all my matches but it never leads to a date."
"The struggles I see on this site confirm that, for the most parts, looks is the most important factor","This is based on what I have observed, not my own ""theories"" etc.

The ""venting"" posts most commonly seen on here fall into a few catagories:

&#x200B;

""I'm a guy, but I can't even get  a match, much less a date""

""I'm a girl, and there is this HOT guy, but he is emotionally unavailable""

""I'm a pretty attractive guy, and I went on a date with girl and we hooked up, she invited me back, and dated for a little bit but she ghosted me""

""I'm a girl, why does it feel like every guy just wants sex? when I go on dates with men they always get sexual""

&#x200B;

Can anyone see a common denominator here? it seems as though a lot of women (at least on here) are going after men who are charming and ""hot"", and confused when they don't want to commit to them. also, there are so many women stating that men ""just want sex"". Yet, I know that a lot of men on here and in real life actually want a relationship. why aren't women matching with these men? it doesn't add up.  On the flip side, most men seem to struggle with even get matches.

Sure, there is the occasional women who can't get a match. or the story of a guy who won over a girl with his personality, but I feel like this are more the exception than the rule. 

from my personal experience, my success skyrocketed when I decided to improve my looks. and by skyrocked it just means I'm able to go on a date with a women I'm interested in at least once a week - doesn't mean things work out at all, in fact that usually don't. why is this the case? Ive always been the same person/etc.  has dating really become this shallow? from my standpoint, If I'm at least somewhat attracted to you (physically), and you can hold a conversation, I'll give you a shot to see if there is additional chemistry. but it seems like a lot  people will chase ""hot"" people continously, despite other personality flaws."
Overthinking In Dating,"This is simply one perspective on an all too common issue that both men and women face in the search for love and connection. When we are looking for love, or someone to love us, our ego often sticks its head out and creates false realities that override what is actually going on around you, in my experience at least and maybe yours too. For instance, at one point I would overthink things so badly that I had simply sent a cute baby animal picture to a girl I had been dating for some time and the result that my overthinking mind came to was that she would either break up with me when she replied or that she would simply stop talking to me. In reality, she was having a terrible day as it just so happened to be the anniversary of her father's death and seeing her favorite baby animal made her day. That text also made us closer as she shared her emotions and about the intimate issues that she suffered from with the loss of her father.

Then again later with this same women, she canceled on one date after never having canceled before and my overthinking mind concluded that she no longer loved me. We spoke for a bit and apparently she had a small procedure and she had some extra swelling. Again, my overthinking mind concluded that this must not be the real issue and the real issue is that she no longer loves me and that I am unlovable although I never let this show. She went on to tell me she really wanted to see me and wanted to see me as soon as she could which didn't settle my mind until I had a two simple realizations.

1. The first realization is that our universe is complete and utter chaos but it only feels chaotic when we fight the true chaos of reality. Take a monk for instance. To truly be a Buhdist monk is to simply be and accept the world as it is and they are at peace. Take for instance the other end of the spectrum the Wall Street stock trader constantly racing to change their life, earn more money and get that next sale constantly filled with stress and anxiety which is the simple truth of not accepting the current state of life and the chaos of life. When you embrace and give in to the chaos and the fact that you really cannot control the world, peace and serenity will come to you and overthinking is nullified.
2. The second is that in order to build a healthy relationship, the basis should be trust and honesty which is not what I was doing. I was not trusting fully when she told me that the reason she wanted to cancel was that she had massive swelling and was too uncomfortable to go on a date. She has never lied to me or be honest up until now and so I have no reason to not believe her but my mind would race to look for the reason behind the reason which was my subconscious trying to find a reason to back up a limiting belief that I have had for some time that ""I am unlovable"" which is false as she very obviously loves me but that limiting belief wanted me to not trust her as it did not match that limiting, false, belief.

I hope this helps you and finds you well. [https://www.tacomabehavioralhealth.com/](https://www.tacomabehavioralhealth.com/)"
"Is it worth it to tell someone you've had a crush on them, when pretty soon you most likely won't be seeing them ever again?","Also I don't expect an answer/yes either, just debating on whether on not to tell her."
You can't make someone like you.,"I see so many people on here upset about being repeatedly rejected. Whether it is people having trouble getting anyone to initially notice them, getting a second date, or ghosting them. They come on here and vent their frustration and usually are met with good advice from people who are genuinely trying to help. Some people suggest working out to build self confidence. Get a hobby to become more interesting. Lose weight. Gain weight. Buy some nicer clothes. Make an interesting online profile. Stop online dating and go to a bar. Practice better hygiene. Be aloof. Be more open. Wait to text back...... the list of advice goes on and the complaints of rejection keep coming.  
To the point. It's great that the people having issues are looking to better yourself. But... oh yes always a but.  
The common theme I see with all the people having these issues is definitely not lack of effort. It is the fact that people are trying to take this advice and change their habits to attract the interest of others. Absolutely the wrong reason to make a lifestyle change. And it will absolutely lead to more rejection and more bitterness. 
Ever seen an asshole... and I mean total asshole that has no problem attracting that dream guy or girl you want. It's because that asshole is totally comfortable in their skin. They know who they are and they are true to themselves. Now I'm not saying be an asshole... I am saying dont change who you are for the sake of someone else, ever. 
If you want to change yourself because you dont like something about yourself, have at it. But the second you compromise your values for the sake of someone else, I can guarantee people sense that, and they sense it as a weakness, and it's not an attractive one. 
"
"If dating makes you upset, you should focus on youself.","TLDR; 

When you enjoy your life enough to be happy while alone, then you become selective. If you find yourself in a hurry to date someone, you should figure out where that internal dependency comes from as it isn't healthy. Anyone can be happy with themselves, you just have to learn. For women afraid of wasting their biological ""clock"": It would seem very selfish to your kids to be in a possibly unhappy relationship just to birth said children.

Long version:

Oh I can smell the hate coming... When I'm on tinder I get a decent amount of matches, probably around 1 match in 5 swipes. But I only swipe out of bordom. I don't swipe just to swipe, but more for finding someone unconventionally attractive. Im the type who doesn't like to date ""hot"" crowd but more along the lines of ""beautiful"". The problem is that my deffinition of beautiful is defined by a feeling I get, almost a love at true site feeling. I've felt it twice my entire life so I know I can find it again.

Now some may say I have high standards, but im happy with my single life. I can hear the angry reditors calling me ""lucky"" or explaing how ""you'de never understand"" but this should apply to everyone. Im in no hurry to get in a relationship. I enjoy college (the studying part-I dont party) and I'm always so busy with activities and self improvment that being alone isnt lonely. So for me its not a standard but more of a ""I have plenty of time to find the right one"" so I don't rush and thus.. I swipe (:

Tinderies message me first all the time asking to go out and we'll do just that. Ive been ghosted (ive never ghosted a soul) ive been told they weren't interested, ive even been preassures/tricked into one night stands (no ones fault but my own). I dont take it personally as ultimately I wouldnt wanna date someone not interested in me anyways. 

Everyone is so upset with online dating not because its bad but because it doesn't fall into their own narrative. Most people on here (not all, but most) only get upset at online dating because they're in a hurry to find someone. When you're happy with yourself and you love yourself, dating isn't a priority and when it isnt a priority you become more successful in your dating life. Its an oximoron, sure, but I find that men can sence desperate woman so they take advantage, and women can sence desperate men so they run.

Dating should be taken slow, it should be done in different ways: online, in person, out at parties, etc.. When you live in a world where selectivity and choice is easy, you should be able to take advantage of it without feeling bad for those you selected against. If you're a guy who is upset because you got a match but no message, its your choice to take it personally and hurt your ego. I don't advicate ghosting or trying to hurt someone, but at the end of the day everyone needs a frame and a barrier to fill that frame.

I wasn't always happy being alone. I was raised by a single mother who dated several men as I grew up, each more abusive than the last. Her dependency issues rubbed off onto me and I always belived I had to date someone to be happy (sure these issues went way beyind that). But honestly, I taught myself that I can be dependent on myself. I can be so happy with my own accomplishments that I may as well be another person. The best thing is, this drives you to accomplish more! Now I hear more reditors calling me ""self-absorbed"" a ""narcasist"", but do we really live in a world where truly being happy with who you are is boiled down to selfish-self love by those who havn't felt it? 

Dating might be a game, but you don't win by racing to the finishline."
How to stop or reduce overthinking?,"I don't know why, but I have recently started overthinking situations when talking to a potential partner. I usually call up my bestfriend and just have him tell me I'm overthinking the situation. 

It's very simple things like being left on read, responding a couple hours later, and misinterpreting a rescheduled date. It's very simple, and most of it could be that the other person is busy, which is probably the case but my mind decides to hit a line of coke and run all over the place.

Any tips?


Background: male, recently out of a long term relationship 4+ years"
"Guy I’m seeing had a bad day, would it be weird if I sent him a coffee/donut with UberEats?",We’ve gone on 4-5 dates and I’ve been to his house a few times so I know the address. I was thinking of sending him something before his next shift. Would it be weird to you if someone sent you food? 
"We’re approaching the 20’s, and quite frankly the current (western) dating culture is toxic as hell.","Point blank, with the proliferation of social media and online dating men have debased themselves for womens’ attention and affection so much online that it’s now having real world consequences. Women have stopped respecting men, and men have stopped respecting themselves when it comes to dating. Therefore, due to women being put on a pedestal by men they’ve become entitled and egotistical. Conversely, men have become so labeled and heaped with promiscuous expectations that they are shamed for not being able to find/have sex or a partner while also being shames for trying *too hard** to have/find sex.

Stop. This subreddit is absolutely filled with borderline cringeworthy posts of (mostly men but some women) lamenting their single, lonely lives, but I have this to say:

Fellas, respect yourselves. Don’t let immature, self-obsessed women disrespect you are cast you aside. If a girl friendzones you, don’t stick around. Find other options and better friends. Don’t be an emotional masochist nor an emotional tampon to girls who have no interest in either sleeping with you or being with you. She isn’t worth your time.

Ladies, respect yourselves too. Don’t let bummy ass dudes waste your time or attention, and be upfront and honest with men who you *know* are interested in you even if you’re afraid of “hurting their feelings”. Rejection hurts, but leading men on hurts more. Y’all have zero excuses, and if a guy can’t take no for an answer then, I dunno, report him to police instead of entertaining this weirdo? 

Seriously... I wasn’t sure whether to flair this as a rant or as advice so I chose the latter; however, y’all need to get your act together. Respect in a relationship, platonic or romantic, is the top priority, and if people don’t respect your time, attention, or presence then cut them out of your life. 

Peace <3

"Why is is so hard to find ""the right one""","After being in a relationship for 5 years, I've been living the single life for 2 years. It's not as glamorous as some people make it seem. I feel my efforts to be myself have fallen short, but see so many happy couple who enjoy the same things I do. It's starting to get hard to put myself out there cause the results have been...slim so far. Dating sites are just awkward cause it almost always relies on the woman messaging first, or just not responding.

I'm a nerdy, geeky, kind of person, that enjoys cosplay, star wars, video games, and cons. I have found that in the 2 years of being single that finding a person who enjoys some of the same things that I do is extremely difficult.

I wish I had more time to attend cons and meet people, and but currently due to work can't. I cant seem to find the right ""recipe.""

I'm hoping someone can point me in the direction to meet/talk to women who enjoy the same things.

If you've made it this far thank you for reading."
"Don’t Give Up Guys, Keep Trying.","I’m single and it’s been awhile since I’ve been in a relationship. When I’m on this subreddit and I see some people giving up or have no hope, I just want to say don’t give up. If you’re not finding anyone, keep working on yourself and focus on your hobbies. Be good at something and you’ll all of sudden find someone. Sometimes love finds you in the weirdest places. So don’t give up, make sure you are the best person you can be and eventually love will find you. 

I know some people have it harder than others, but there’s really good qualified people who seem to be losing hope. Just be patient, do whatever you can do gain self-esteem and I think before you know it, you’ll find someone.

Have a good day. Take care."
A call to end ghosting,"It SUCKS to know you might hurt someone’s feelings. It really does. But it’s even worse to leave them in the dark. In this post, I propose we all (myself included) work to end mismatches and small flings with maturity and grace. 

Ghosting leaves individuals without a sense of closure. Closure, as we might know from personal experience, is incredibly important to many of us! When we are ghosted, we leave even the most casual encounters with a sense of unease and, perhaps, the tiniest bit of what feels like grief. 

I have been working on ending mismatches or flings I have met in person with simple sentences. My most general is, “I don’t feel this is a match.” Generally, it goes over well. Yes, I do have a fear someone will cling and make promises they cannot possibly keep. This is where my boundary setting skills get tested and I repeat that this isn’t a good match and wouldn’t work. 

I try not to bring up any personal things- sometimes it has nothing to do with who the person is, but rather who I am as a person. We’re all trying to find matches, and just because one doesn’t work out doesn’t meant there’s anything wrong with either. It’s simply not a good match. ANYWAYS I got off topic. 

END GHOSTING. Let’s be mature adults! 

Thank you.

EDIT: I’ve gotten enough responses assuming that I’m pissed off that I’m getting ghosted that I feel I should clarify on the post instead of individual comments: first, I am a woman...not a man. Second, I have been reflecting on my own ghosting and realized it’s kind of shitty of me to do. I’m not trying to change anyone, make them do what I think they should do. I’m just putting it out there that perhaps there are better ways to communicate than just ignoring people.

Thank you."
It can and will happen.,"I've not had a relationship in five years.

My last relationship (five years ago) ended in a trainwreck. She cheated on me. I had some pretty deep wounds from it and my love live absolutely suffered.

I felt worthless after she told me what she'd done. I felt like I was not good enough for anyone. I convinced myself I would just die alone.

Because of this, I did not pursue anything for a year. I just couldn't muster up the courage to get back into the chase.

After that year, I started taking shots with women again but for the past four years I've struck out. Time after time I'd been rejected (with the exception of one girl which ultimately did not work out).

But I've kept my head up, and because I haven't quit, I have a budding relationship with a magnificent, talented woman. 

The ONLY reason I have this girl is because I continued to search despite the rejections or failed dates.

Friends: DON'T GIVE UP. I promise you, someone is out there. It can and will happen. I am a testament to that statement. Don't give up."
FINALLY...,"After countless first dates that go nowhere, dealing with about 5 different ghosts in 6 months, and the flakes.... I'm glad to say I've finally found myself a girlfriend who has everything I'm exactly looking for. Keep your heads up my friends, nothing in life is easy, but that doesn't mean you need to give up. "
"Looks absolutely matter, more than you think","I'm tired of the men/women that think they're high and mighty when they say ""yeah looks arent that important, I want a guy that can make me laugh and make me smile""

Its bullshit. Lifting weights for just under a year has made life so fucking better for me.

Not just casual dating, but life in general. People glow around me. They open up and they treat me better. I get invited to events and I have much better conversations with the people around me. 

I have had girls actually approach me. The whole ""girls dont approach men"" thing is bullshit I've come to find. 

You want to improve your dating life? Hit the gym and lift. Lift and dont stop until you've got a damn good body.

"unpopular opinion: in your thirties, the ""good ones"" are actually all taken?","I always heard ""the good ones are taken"", and thought ""nah, thats just generalizing, there are plenty of people who are single for a reason - maybe it is their career they are focusing on? or they just got out of a bad breakup and was going to marry the person? or they were taking care of their ailing parents"".

&#x200B;

Then I started meeting single people, going on dates, and slowly realized that the people I went on dates/etc with that were still single in their late twenties and beyond were drastically different than people Id meet who were married/taken etc. like, no matter what happened, the person eventually turned into ""ahhhhh this is why she is single"".  Either there was some very quirky about their personality, they looked way worse in pictures, they were attractive but just....not pleasant people. or...there was just nothing....attractive about the person? I cant explain it.

&#x200B;

As I'm doing this I would meet the most incredible women...that were all married (I'm a social person).  Sometimes I would hear that they met when they were in the lowest of lows...or when they were ""focusing"" on their career, etc. it was not dependent on the situation, it was dependent on the person. which means to me that people are willing to give ""the good ones"" a chance, despite where they are in life.

&#x200B;

And then my ego took a huge hit. By this logic, I must not be one of the ""good ones"". there is a reason why I'm not taken...and its probably more something to do with me than anything else."
New girl,I just met this girl off of tinder and I’m over the moon. She was a lot more than I expected she would be and she’s got me feeling like I did in high school. Honestly didn’t think tinder would allow me to meet someone as amazing as she. Plus we have another date on Thursday.
I am realizing I have an anxious attachment style and I am making a total ass of myself in every type of relationship in my life.,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I looked through the history of this thread on the subject of anxious attachment style, and I really wanted to vent. 

Ever since I was younger, like dating in high school, I realized I romanticized things and attached easy. It caused a lot of toxic relationships. 

When I finally made it on my own in the world and moved away from home, I realized that many factors in my life, including abuse from my mother when I was a child (she is NPD and BPD), have caused me to develop an anxious attachment style — in every type of relationship in my life, including friendships, family and casual things. 

When I first meet someone, I’m chill. They tell me how respectful, genuine and relaxed I am, and they like me because I respect their boundaries... until I don’t and sabotage. 

Most of the time, I push away and ghost, but other times, I become this ridiculous person, insecure and emotional, over the tiniest emotional spark. If I have a NSA hook up with someone, I’m someone else, this calm, collected, cool, mysterious, fascinating person. But then the moment we find we have a lot in common or we vibe well, I start to feel vulnerable and it makes me act like a lunatic. 

It’s really embarrassing and it’s not me. Over years of therapy and medication, thankfully I’ve overcome a lot of self esteem issues, depression and PTSD, but I’ve noticed there are some remnants of anxiety and insecurities I am having trouble overcoming. 

All of my past boyfriends have cheated on me or abused me, and I feel this has torn me apart emotionally. I don’t want to be insecure. 

I mean, my life is insane. I work, I have several hobbies, I have things keeping me busy, and yet I fall into this awful behavior that makes me look bored, desperate and needy. 

I need to kick this crap to the curb, because I’ve met some really awesome people lately, but I can’t seem to “go with the flow” or “take it slow,” and I give off this vibe in the beginning that I’m pretty cool with all of that, and then turn into this over dramatic person. Texting too much, calling too much, overthinking every interaction. Wondering if they even like me. 

It’s so unattractive and embarrassing. 

I have to talk myself through everything, telling myself to chill, that they’re human and this isn’t even a thing yet, and I’m going to ruin it if I don’t shut up and go with the flow like I should. 

I hate to be a walking red flag. I hate knowing at any moment I’ll sabotage something good (before it even begins at times) because of this. 

Can someone help me understand this? I have been in therapy for four years and on medication for two. I guess I just have to keep working at it...."
Best. Ghosting. Reason. Ever.,"Him to me; ‘We can’t meet again because I get abducted by aliens most nights’. 

He then avoided me at work until he was fired 12 months later for sexual harassment."
"Cute girl sat next to me on the bus, contemplated asking her out - then I was so glad I didn't.","Seemed on purpose as well - chose the seat right next to me while most of the bus was empty. Pretty cute, bookish - my type, and of course I was too inactive to strike up a conversation. Kicked myself while she got off the bus a few stops later.

And walked straight into the Scientology building on the corner.

Just feeling a bit glad my incompetence saved me from a huge incompatibility... or perhaps a bit shit that I'm attracting all the crazies. Hope this isn't the only time this happens though."
Confronted Ghoster,"I should have done this a long time ago but I finally did it. I finally spoke my truth instead of acting like I’m cool with everything he does. 

I used to date this guy and while I thought things were going well, he ghosted me. And then came back months later like nothing happened. That should’ve been when I confronted him but I didn’t. A few months ago the topic came up over text and he told me he was depressed at the time and apologized. I accepted the apology but never wanted to see him again. 

I haven’t seen him ever since but we do talk sometimes. Yesterday over the phone he spoke about meeting up. I said— I’m not going anywhere with you because I never want to see you again. he said why not? And I said “why, so you can disappear again and come back like nothing happened? I understand you were going through something at the time but that doesn’t mean you just leave the other person hanging. I felt very disrespected and I hope you don’t ever put anyone else through that” I tried to keep my tone as calm and nice as possible lol. Yeah I may seem crazy that it still bothers me til this day but I can’t risk getting my feelings hurt again. I still don’t know what his intentions were/are. 

It was hard to do but I’m glad I did. Not sure if I’ll ever hear from him again. Probably will on ig. I just had to be honest with myself. I did not mention how much I miss him and how much I enjoyed spending time with him because I didn’t want to give him a ego boost. 
F ghosters and ppl who lead other ppl on."
Am I too picky or am I unattractive?,"I never get matches on Tinder or Bumble. To be fair, I swipe right quite rarely, but I'd expect to get the odd match here and there. In the past 8 months I've had one match on Bumble, who unmatched me before saying anything, and maybe 5 matches on Tinder, who didn't respond and subsequently unmatched. 

The thing is I generally think I'm physically attractive, but given my track record it would seem that I am not... I think I need to lower my standards, but even when I'm desperate I don't seem to be able to do that..

On a side note: Tinder says I have 2 likes. Is this accurate?? Two people on the entirety of Tinder in my radius have swiped me right??!! I'M A FIVE STAR MAN, DAMMIT!

EDIT: Ok folks. I have heard your resounding hatred of the bio and that shall be re-worked. I am definitely going to regret this, but for those asking, here is my first pic: [Pic](http://imgur.com/a/5EHWoEf)"
I really just need to tell anyone that I met someone,"I really want to tell my best friend and/or my sister/ family. *However!* The last three guys that I've been excited about, got at least a couple months into dating, told my best friend and then within a week of telling her, the guy has ghosted me or sent the 'i'm not ready after all' text.

So, instead I'm going to tell a bunch of strangers on the internet about how I met this guy (off Tinder no less) and I'm love hanging out with him, sex is great, he treats me super well, etc. 

I'm just excited that I finally connected with someone that likes me for me and vice versa. Fingers crossed this doesn't jinx anything"
Don’t date if you don’t have the time,"This should be common sense, but if your schedule is too busy to even make free time for yourself, please don’t date. I’m so sick of being strung along by people with ridiculous schedules where it’s like pulling teeth to make plans. How can you expect to have a serious relationship if it’s so difficult to even meet up for the first time?

I’m tired of getting my hopes up about someone only to find out that they are never available to meet in person. I’m not looking for a texting buddy. "
I woke up at 5 am and got broken up with,"I doubt anyone will see this because it’s almost 6 by this point, and I’m sorry if this breaks the subreddits rules, but I just needed to vent.

I’ve been dating this girl for two months now, and everything was going really well. On Thursday I helped her pack her car to get home, and we promised that we would try and see each other over break. The town that we go to school at is halfway between where we each live, so it was definitely in the realm of possibility.

We had been texting since break started and talked on the phone Sunday night when she got home from work. I woke up late yesterday (around 11) and sent her a good morning text. She didn’t text me back because she had work, and had been busy all through the weekend, and I didn’t think much of it. Eventually it got to be evening with no reply, and then almost midnight, so I sent her another text saying goodnight and went to bed.

I woke up at 5am to find a text about how even though she liked me, and that we had talked about our relationship, that she wanted to break things off, and wanted more ‘autonomy,’ and that she’s ‘just not feeling it’. I honestly don’t know what to feel. I thought things were going great, but obviously they weren’t, and now I’m lying in bed typing this up wide awake.

In the words of Captain Raymond Holt:

“Everything is garbage. Never love anything.”"
Being close with someone i started dating,"Just started dating someone a month or so go. We were getting hot and heavy last night and she was laying on top of me and we started having a random conversation. It's the closest I've been when someone and it was an amazing experience.

Very happy to be dating her 😁"
Guys need to stop filtering themselves for girls that won't like them anyways.,"I'm  a 30 year old man, and I can't even find enough fingers to count how many times I've  bit my tounge to the point where it looks like a dogs chew  toy in my early 20s. 

And for what? To please a girl into believing she knows you when youre just filtering  yourself? It's  not worth it. The woman that likes you will get your humor. She'll  laugh the fuck out of your jokes and she'll  vibe with you when the others think you're  obnoxious.

We're  not put on this earth to be a people pleaser. If someone  doesn't  like you. Simply and kindly say"" take a number"". Be yourself and whoever will come your way will be there. 

"
Hookup culture sucks,"How do you guys do it. I’m a young woman in my early 20s and not into hookups and I realize I might be in the minority, but how do you deal with dating when all guys wanna do is hookup. 

I went on a date with a guy who I matched with on a dating app told him I wasn’t into hookups and sure enough when I told him I wasn’t into hookups he kicked me out (in hindsight the fact that we were meeting up at his place to go hotubbing is a sign I missed) but still I don’t do hookups due to reasons, for other young women my age who don't do hookups how do you manage with the fact that all guys want to do is hookup.

I feel like I’m gonna be alone forever for not hooking up but I shouldn’t have to hookup to get a boyfriend it’s so frustrating.

Edit: For those telling me to not online date it’s not just online dating. I’ve met guys through bars, parties, buses, park and most want to hook up from the chad type to the nice guy type. The ones who don’t are taken or gay lol.

Apparently someone linked this to the MGTOW sub 🤷🏾‍♀️"
Every time a guy messages me out of the blue...,"Guy: hey! Been a while. How have you been?


Me: pretty good! How are you?


Guy: well me and my gf/wife/whatever broke up


Guy: but good thanks!"
Who's with me?,"Why is it so damn hard to simply find someone worth giving a shit about who also gives a shit back?

That's all I want. "
"Guys who were late bloomers, how did you manage to get your first date/kiss?","22 year old virgin guy here, never been on a date. I've tried every dating site under the sun but never got any matches or replies. Been clubbing numerous times but no girls were interested. When I was at college I joined the drama club to get out of my comfort zone and perhaps meet some like minded women. Made guy friends but women just weren't interested in me. 

Any other guys who were in my position? How did you change it?"
Feel like I won't ever find someone. I don't know what to do anymore.,"I don't know what to do anymore. I've been single my entire life and at 25 years old I am starting to become afraid, afraid at the very possibility that I'll be alone forever and never find anyone. Everyone always says to be positive, focus on yourself, it'll happen when it happens, but I'm starting to believe thats just something people say to make you feel better so you don't lose hope.

I remember seeing a therapist when I was 20 and about to enter my junior year of college and we talked a lot about this. He told me ""It'll happen when its meant to happen."" 5 years later and it still hasn't happened. Not for lack of trying either, I hang out with friends, go out whenever I'm invited somewhere, been on every dating site/app for the past 5 years, joined sports clubs to meet new people, and it still hasn't gotten me anywhere. Now I'm just at a loss on what to do and I'm staring to worry, like really worry.

I've gotten some dates the past two years from online dating, but almost all of them ended after the first date and It takes months of swiping, liking, and messaging girls to even get the slightest prospect of a date. The most recent girl I went out with that I met online, we dated for a month and I thought I was finally gonna get laid, I was almost positive I would. But she had just gotten out of a relationship and wasn't ready to have sex yet, and I respected that so we held off. A few weeks later she ended things. That was almost 2 months ago and I haven't had any prospects since. 

Every person I know who has or had a girlfriend (Which at my age, is pretty much everybody) has met their girl at school, work, or through friends. None of these have worked for me. I'm no longer in school, I don't work with any girls at my job, and my friends don't introduce me to any girls. After college I joined a bunch of coed sports leagues hoping to meet some people, maybe a girl, but nothing has really happened with that. I'm starting to look at other options like volunteering or joining a class, but I feel the odds of actually meeting a girl there who is single, my age, and we're both attracted to each other is incredibly slim. I also don't want to join something for the wrong reasons. 

I try to look at the bright side of it all everyday, but it is just so hard sometimes. I know I have to do something different, but I don't want to cold approach strangers or join a group I have no interest in. Like, just last night I wanted to go out in the city with my friends and maybe talk to some girls, but none of them wanted to do anything but sit inside, play video games, drink and smoke weed, so I had to just stay in with them. So that is just another lost opportunity lost. Pretty soon the work week will start again and unless I want to bother people at the grocery store or gym I won't be meeting any girls. 

Sorry for the long post, I've had a lot on my mind and just needed to get it out. If anyone has had a similar problem and got out of it I would love to hear how you did it. And I'm still currently seeing a therapist (A different one), as well as meditating and trying to be mindful of my thoughts whenever I start to think negative. Thanks."
Why are 'taken' women on dating sites?,"I had a 'like' on ILikeyou but on her profile it says 'taken'. Surely that means she isn't single, so then why is she active on there? I don't get it. Polygamous relationship?"
The grass is always greener in OLD!!!,I'm just venting but what I've discovered is most people online are always under the illusion that they can find better. They never wanna commit to an actual person (seeing one person on a regular basis) and just wanna go with the flow to see their options. Well fuck that! I'm not a fucking disposable thing to consider only if options A&B called out! Either you wanna be with me or you don't. Either you're interested or you're not. It's not that complicated.
How many of you are lonely?,"I am an introverted person [24F] who has never dated anyone before. Back home, I kept to myself and stayed home a lot. Then I moved to another about 5 months ago country and started trying to meet new people and make new friends. Despite attempts to put myself out there, still nothing has happened. 

This isn’t a post asking about what I should do because I know things take time and I’ll have to be patient. What I’m struggling with is the loneliness. I also know how to deal with the loneliness, i.e. have a hobby, find things to do, etc. and I’ve been doing all those as well. 

But the loneliness I’m talking about is one that you can’t shake off no matter how much concentration you’re putting into whatever you’re doing. It’s the kind of loneliness that makes you wish you had someone to text with all day. The kind of loneliness that makes you hate that the only notifications you receive are emails and social media. The kind that creeps back in after you’ve had a good time with friends or finished a good game session. 

This same loneliness is also felt back home because I have a very typical asian family where we don’t talk about things and show our feelings. So I’ve never felt homesick and am actually very happy to be away from home. 

How many of you feel the same way? And how many of you FELT the same way, and how was it like after you’ve been relieved of the pain? "
You Know What Sucks?,"When the people you're into just aren't into you, and for those who are into you, you just don't feel that romantic vibe from them..the struggle be real out here yall lol"
Does anyone else find it shitty that you need to clearly establish you are exclusive in today’s dating,"I went on several dates(10 dates) with one girl and then I see that she was on a date with another guy at a restaurant I’m eating at with my family.

I confront her about this and she’s like yeah I was gonna tell you...I was angry and was like tell me what...she was like oh I just wasn’t feeling it anymore and that she isn’t my girlfriend. 

I told her we went on several dates...after a few dates, can’t you safely assume we are boyfriend-girlfriend. She responds well you never explicitly asked to be exclusive. She had been going on dates with several guys while going on dates with me. 

I also met her over tinder."
"If you gotta think too much about doing it, it's not worth doing","When it comes to relationships, dating, hooks ups, whatever, if you're constantly driving yourself nuts replaying scenarios, scrutinizing behavior, surveilling the person, or figuring them out by way of ""clues"" or some shit, it's just not worth it. You're not gonna live forever, so giving people undue time and attention is really, really just not worth it lol. Cut people off. Be unceremonious about it. Block people, delete numbers. Who tf cares, it's your life, you gotta look out for yourself first and foremost. If someone is fucking up your peace of mind get rid of them as easily as possible. "
Some people honestly surprise me.,"Technically it wasn’t a date, but I was having a girls’ night out with my friend and a guy at the bar started talking to me. My friend had been preoccupied at the moment, so it was all right; initially I thought he was cute and liked him well enough.

Then it started taking a nosedive. He started telling me about his life, which I didn’t have much of a problem with on its own—I seem to have a face that screams “Unload your troubles and tell me your life story”, so I’m long-accustomed to this sort of thing and open to it. He told me about his brother’s death, which I was very sorry to hear about. I expressed my condolences, and we began talking about grief. Trying to contribute to the conversation, I told him about losing my dad at a young age. He basically told me that we’re meant to lose our parents and that losing a sibling was worse. I honestly didn’t know what to say to that. Don’t get me wrong, I feel horrible that he lost his brother. But it’s not the damn Grief Olympics. Looking back, he hadn’t even said so much as “Sorry for your loss”. 

It only went downhill from there as I found out we were mutual friends with somebody very close to me, and when I brought it up, he started absolutely trashing this friend (who was thankfully not present). I tried to get in a positive word about my friend edgewise, but he prattled on. At this point, I was thinking “Fuck this”. 

Later that night, he asked me what my plans were. Unsure of what exactly about, I began telling him about the school I am attending. He became impatient and irritated, and clarified that he meant my plan for the night. When I apologized, politely telling him that I was going back with my friend, his entire face darkened and he began huffing a little, shifting in his seat and rolling his eyes angrily. After finding out that he wasn’t taking me home for the night, his entire demeanor had completely blackened with him being clipped and standoffish for the rest of the night.

Needless to say, I made sure that he left the bar before my friend and I left. Bye Felipe."
Does anyone else feel extra lonely on Sunday evenings?,"I don’t know what it is about Sunday evenings- maybe it’s the end of your free reign on the weekends, maybe the stress on Monday workweek. But I end up missing my ex and just feeling lonely and depressed in general about not having anyone to hug and cuddle with.
Anyone else can relate ? "
I hope all of you find what you are looking for.,All of you have value just by being who you are. No one is worthless. I wish you all the best you could hope for yourself.
All you can do is be your best self.,"That’s really all you can do. Everything else is out of your control. So be generous, be kind, be brave, text back right away if you can, show you’re interested, be interested, love and hope to be loved in return, tell your crush you like them, ask them out, wear your heart on your sleeve. All you can do is what you can control.

So do it and put your best foot out there. The worst that can happen is that you find out right away that you’re not a good fit for someone - and that’s still a great thing to know. It’s a win win situation!"
are some people destined to be alone?,"as a 34 year old guy with difficulty speaking to people, being shy, boring, not able to make people laugh, it seems completely hopeless.
what do you think? are some people just so deeply flawed that friendship, love, sex are impossible?"
Does anyone else not care about asking someone out until you have a crush on them?,"Am I the only one who has never really wanted to ask someone out before getting to know them/having some sort of feelings for the person? I've never seen someone and thought ""Oh they're attractive let me talk to them/ask them out and see where it goes"". 

Just curious if anyone else has had similar experience."
Where should one (23 f) go to meet someone who is not a fuckboy,"23 (f) who cannot find  boyfriend material. Before you say go anywhere, I do go out quite a bit. I hike, dance, gym, go clubbing, etc. Every single man that I do date/meet does not want anything serious and will say that eventually. What am I doing wrong and where do all the great guys hang out? I feel like all of the great guys I meet are taken or “fuck boys”."
PSA for online dating always have a nice photo of yourself,"If you are going to use online dating then you must have a good clear photo of yourself on your profile.  If you refuse to do this then you will not get people who will respond to your messages.  Most sites have filters where you can make it so only people with photos can message you.  You have people who will upload a photo of a lake and try to get around the photo filter.  a photo without you in it is still considered not having a photo.  If you have no desire to upload a photo of yourself on your profile then online dating is not for you and you should just delete your profile.  No one joins online dating to not see who they are talking to.  95% of people who refuse to put a photo of themselves on their profile are almost always in a relationship and cheating or are married and cheating.

\*edit\*

I am not here to crap on people or put people down.  I am here to give good advice to people to help them be able to find their life partner.  I want people to feel happy and be happy.  I know how hard it is to feel hopeless and alone, as I myself have felt like that.  Once I decided to change the way I think about online dating I was able to find someone great and it worked out.  Any one of you in here can truly find someone great as long as you are not negative about yourself and you put photos up of what you actually look like.  I know it is hard to here but it works.  Some of you are just so hell bent on the fact that it is not gonna work and you are being so negative, which is probably why you are not having luck finding someone for yourself.  If you just be a little more confident in yourself you will find someone.  If you are not at all happy with yourself and how you look then you should take a step back from online dating and work on yourself until you are at least a good portion of the way happy with yourself.  If you are going to continue to go down a negative path and shoot down anyone trying to give you helpful advice then you are going to have a hard time trying to find someone.  I take it the people in this post with such negativity in their comments have deep rooted issues with themselves and their family members.  You also seem to possibly have deep rooted issues with someone in your past that has hurt you.  I suggest you help yourself if you feel down and out."
Just a friendly reminder...,"Ghosting is not okay. 

If you've made concrete plans to go on a date (whether it's a 1st or 10th), and you're suddenly getting second thoughts...

Then put on your adult pants and TELL the other party. Ghosting is one of the most immature ""outs"" you have.

This is coming from someone who was really looking forward to another date. We texted back and forth until the day prior to the date. And then they vanished. I'll probably never know the reason, but for a solid few hours, I felt crushed, wondering what I did wrong, or if I just wasn't good enough.

And it's not worth making someone go through those mental gymnastics. Rip the proverbial band-aid off, be honest, and at least give the other person a REASON. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk."
Some Things I've Been Doing to Get Over My Ex,"Some things I've done to help me get over my ex dumping me. The basic idea behind all of these is that you should do thoughtful things you would've done for your ex, but now just do it for strangers/people you care about.  Some examples:

1. Randomly bought my roommate fudge and ice cream when he had a bad day.
2. Gifted flowers to some of my girl neighbors, with a note wishing them a great day.
3. Took myself and/or a friend on a date.  I personally like smoothie dates.
4. Danced to my favorite music in my room. Rediscovered old songs, discovered new ones.
5. Volunteered. I started doing manicures for old people at a retirement home.  I've never done or had a manicure in my life. It's been a fun learning process haha.
6. Worked out.  I'm already a pretty fit guy, but now that I have the extra motivation you can bet I'm gonna be setting some new PRs.
7. Dove even deeper into hobbies.  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and music production have been saving my ass.

Some inspiration to those with an aching heart that are trying to figure out healthy ways of not just sitting in bed obsessing over their ex.  To recap: **Do shit you would've done for her while you were in the relationship, but now do it for others.**

It's hard to not make them look like a monster for dumping you when your goto coping mechanism is to kill them with kindness ;)"
"I’ve been on dating apps for 6 years and have gone on around 100 dates, AMA","Started with only Tinder, then got bumble and hinge.

•had a 4 month relationship with a girl from tinder, 1.5 year relationship with a girl from bumble, and a 3 month FWB situation"
As a general rule: NEVER EVER make any important relationship decision while you are horny,"I feel like this is something most people should live by, not just me. This applies to anyone of any gender cause believe me I've seen it in both. Think with your brain, not with other things

Take care out there yall"
Finding it hard to date someone when I am 6ft2 female,"I have found it hard to date anyone. Guys who are shorter love everything about me except my height. Some have even gone as far as saying that they would be embarrassed to be with me in public. That I’ve ticked all the boxes so if that’s the one thing that’s untucked it shouldn’t be an issue.. but it always ends up having something to do with it. 

Even then because I’m “supermodel height” guys see me as the one they want to have sex with and not who they want to date and build a life with. I just don’t understand it."
Chronic frustration with the dating scene (Venting),"(31 M), it feels like I've been dealt a bad hand after bad hand for years now.    
    
Since 2013, I've tried to put myself out there (I.E. OkCupid); nothing ever came of it. Over the successive years, if there is an app, I probably used it. In all that time only four first dates, with nothing after. Last year I decided to take a hiatus from the apps.    
    
Being a regular at a local gym, another regular decided to play matchmaker and introduced me to a mutual friend last Monday. It was non-stop texting until last Thursday (went out to diner) then radio silence. Taking the higher ground I sent a follow-up on Saturday with no response. I only found out from the mutual friend the ""nice guy"" excuse. I would have accepted hearing it from her directly instead of acting immature and avoiding it (We're adults here).   
    
Taking a stab at the apps again, by god they all look the same and quite frankly boring and unoriginal. Within minutes I uninstalled.     
   
I never had success back in school, work is a sausage fest. People saying ""you'll find someone"" is increasing sounding hollow and paying lip service.    
    
Edit, I never excepted this to blow up like it did. Fortunately the information may not just help me out, but others as well"
Realizing someone lost interest in you feels bad,"So I started seeing this girl since novembre and at first it seemed like we are equally enthusiastic about each other, being responsive to text messages and making sure we see each other once a week. 

We didn't spend New Years together, haven't had much contact with her since, except some smalltalk about her moving to a new place and her going to the cinema with someone to watch a movie we didn't even consider watching on a date (hmm...)

&#x200B;

While I obviously wish it is because she is stressed out due to moving and work, its 2019 and I know she is online and could just leave me a quick response, so I am doubtful that I'll see or hear much of her anymore. Still it kinda sucks that people cannot tell you when they lose interest and silently leave you hanging there instead: 

this morning I woke up and felt bad, thought to myself how shitty it is that I feel like I cannot function properly for such a stupid reason.

&#x200B;

Kinda torn between straight out not engaging in that person/contact anymore or to at least wait out her moving places before I make my decision. Sry for the rant, had to vent some stuff"
"PLEASE, just post pictures that reflect your current weight.","I’m overweight, so i’m not here to body shame anyone. The reason I say this is because I think that when people make it seem like they’re thinner than they are, they look worse in comparison- even if it isn’t bad. ‘Weight gain’ seems like a bigger deal than just ‘was always a little chubby’, if that’s what you’re expecting. Be honest with people- there is no good outcome with lying to people about your body. Just wait for people who appreciate you to come along, because they will!"
Dating is so fckn complicated! Stop taking people for granted! Let them know what you really want!,"So you dated this person. You liked her or him. You always hang out. Dinner, coffee, talk, sex, enjoy life. But then you don't know where you place yourself. Because you both are so complicated! You want to keep each other's company but don't ask for any assurance or validation if they are gonna stay or what. Because you're scared that if you ask them they might run away. Scared of commitments, scared of another broken promises, another mistake. 

Dating is fucking complicated. You want love or no, companion, lover or friend, friends with benefit perhaps?  You want to give your all,but you keep on hesitating. 

The thing is, in the end what we really craving is love. Admit it, we are all lonely in this shitty world! Friends might help for a while, but we still crave for something. We need a lover.

We entered dating not just for sex. But to feel noticed, taken cared of, loved. Truly loved. To feel special. If this person started dating you, they need you as well like you needed them. Stop taking people for granted."
"How can I keep a chat alive if she only says ""ahahah"" ""yeah"" and things like this?","This girl started the conversation but after a while she starts to write empty messages that do not offer ""handholds"" to continue talking. On these occasions sometimes i send her some memes to have some interaction but when she keeps laughing i don't know what to do. It's not on tinder and we already had a date went good but we live a bit far and then she want to talk.
What can i do?"
"Another ""I'm tired of dating"" rant","I'm just tired of dating. I'm 30, apparently I'm a ""catch"", but I can't find a guy that I'm compatible with. I'm tired of going through boyfriends. I'm tired of online dating, it's just... gross most of the time. I'm tired of meeting men with significant emotional issues. Lately it seems like all the guys I'm meeting are abusive, have porn addiction issues, attachment issues, only want casual hookups, have unreasonable expectations, etc. etc.

I'm taking a time out from dating. I'm happy being alone, and I'd rather be single and doing my own thing than settle for someone/something that wouldn't make me happy. It's just weird to hit your 30s and see all your friends/family in long term, serious relationships while you're just... alone.

(As an aside, I know there are still great guys out there, and I know hetero men struggle with dating too. This is just me ranting about my current situation.)"
Has anyone ever been infatuated with the “idea” of a person but no so much the person themselves.,"Hey reddit,
So I just realised today , that perhaps the person I have a crush on I don’t really like , it’s more “the mental image” of them which I have created in my mind. You see this we’ve know each other for quite a while, but only began texting a couple of months ago. It was this whole process of texting them that I really started to develop feelings ( perhaps it was due to the fact of loneliness for such a long ) . But you see our interaction by text and IRL are different. When I see her IRL  I’m not infatuated, by all means she’s attractive, but she’s not some “be all end all “figure I have painted her out to be.  IRL we just talk like friends, but when we text it’s different. Maybe it’s because my infatuation has decreased  because “i see them as hard to get”. 


TLDR 
I think I’m more attracted to the image and concept of a person being a romantic partner, created through weeks of texting . Yet IRL , I just see them as more of a normal person"
How do you meet girls in your early 20s?,"So I (M20) have never dated, or even kissed a girl. I graduated from school about 2 years ago and have been serving my mandatory service in the army for the past year. When I'm done in January, I will apply for pilot school. 

However, I'm feeling that my life is a bit empty. There are no intimacy, and in general I feel a bit lonely. I have very few friends that I actually hang with and they all study so I mostly sit alone. When we actually got time, we only play video games and honestly, I could use some changes in my life.

I want to start dating, get some experience there and see if that could fill a bit of the empty space in me. Only thing is that as I said, I have no experience with girls at all. I dont interact with many girls regularily and honestly, I think dating apps wpuld be my most viable option.
However, I'm not very photogenic, so getting pics I'm satisfied with will be a challange :P Dont get me wrong though, I do think I am an above average looking dude.

Anyway, Im looking for other suggestions as well as tips and ideas about what I can do! Anything would be great! :)"
You have no right to complain about being single/people being shallow if your dating profile is full of old/misleading pics,"It's hilarious how often this happens with both girls and guys. You match with someone on whatever app/site you're using, agree to meet up, and then they show up looking little like the actual person you matched with. Then you realize they've been using pics from years ago, pics that have been angled/filtered a certain way, etc

I've seen so many of these people complain that there's unfair standards, that everyone else is shallow and places too much emphasis on looks, whatever. And they're completely missing the point: you being 20 pounds heavier than in the past isn't the issue, it's the fact that you had to lie and deceive someone into meeting you that's the problem. It also screams insecurity. If you're lying from the get-go the relationship, assuming it happens, will be toxic. Unless the other person is desperate and happy with anyone

Worried that people won't be attracted to you because you've gained weight? Stop manipulating them on your profile and put that effort into actually going to the gym and eating healthier. Until then, don't complain that nobody wants to date you. It's your own doing"
"if a girl sends you nudes, try and act excited?","idk man. just a girl tired of sending nudes and getting “sexy” or “those are nice” or an emoji in response. gas me UP, god dammit. do u have any idea how much time and attention to detail goes in to taking a good nude. try and act excited??????? or don’t ask for them?

edit: SOLICITED NUDES JESUS "
"Why is it that once your in a relationship with a girl, more women than before seem to be interested in you?",I’ve noticed this in the past. I’ll start dating a girl and when we’re in public more women start to look in my direction. And women that I already knew start to act more interested. Why? 
What is the point of Bumble exactly?,"I'm seriously beyond frustrated have now been trying internet dating for the better part of 10 years and not once has it landed me a single relationship. 

I get matches no problem but each and every time on this stupid app I get a message from the girl I respond to what is usually just a "" Hey"" or "" what's up"" with my greet in return and before the conversation goes anywhere or leads to a date the girl just seems to forget she even messaged me and doesn't respond. So why even send me a message? Why is my time being continually wasted?

So why girls? Why are you on this site if you don't have any serious intent on actually going on dates having sex and who knows maybe having a fucking boyfriend. 

Make a fucking effort please for the love of men. "
Best thing I ever did was delete the apps and lay off social media,"So I have been in the constant cycle of dating apps for a few years now since I got out of college. It has had it's ups and downs and honestly I wouldn't change a thing. About 6 months ago I had a small epiphany and realized how disposable the dating apps make people, guys and girls, because I was just as flaky. Anyways, around the same time I deleted all the apps, I decided to take facebook, insta, etc off my phone as well. I still check them from time to time but my rule is it has to be on my laptop, so I'm not checking throughout the day basically. It's given me some perspective, and I think I'm a little happier with my own life now, and I appreciate inner beauty much much more. 

I reconnected with a girl I dated on and off for a while earlier this year, but ultimately phased away from her because I didn't feel that ""x factor"" I guess. Come to find out, she just wasn't physically good enough for me. So I wrote her off subconsciously because I was shallow about image. Now that I don't care about social media and I am not constantly window shopping on dating apps, I had a drink with her and gave it an honest chance. She is so sweet, and we have so much in common. One of the only girls I have ever met to make me genuinely laugh out loud. I don't know what will happen long term, or even in the interim, but man is it a good feeling. As if a veil has been lifted from my face to reveal the finer things in life all these dating apps are masking. I'm not a white knight trying to preach to you guys and tell you that you're morons for being on the apps, I met this girl on bumble myself last year, I guess I'm just saying to have some perspective. I know a lot of us here feel like we are spinning our wheels sometimes.

Anyways, good luck to all you guys and gals. Sorry for any typos I typed this pretty fast while on the toilet at work. 



TL;DR : I deleted dating apps and managed my time on social media to better appreciate the more meaningful relationships in life"
You have more to offer than just your physical appearance.,"Just a little reminder to those who are online dating (or dating in general). The right people well accept you for all of you and the wrong people aren’t meant to be in your life. 

Edit: 

To clarify, I didn’t mean that physical appearance does not matter at all. I’m just saying that there is more to offer than just looks. 

It’s important to maximize your attractiveness: workout, eat healthy, groom yourself, dress nicely, take care of yourself in general so that it increases the chances of getting a date. When you look good, you feel good and people will feel that energy about you. You must ultimately love yourself first and not expect people to love you if you cannot love yourself. You cannot pour from an empty cup. 

I do agree that men have a harder time dating than woman. For the simple fact that woman are generally more desired than men etc and I can’t relate because I am not a male. 

I was just making a point to remind people that you have more to offer the world and the opposite sex than just your physical appearance, but this post turned into a good discussion and I appreciate everyone’s input and comments. :) 

Loneliness and rejection hurt but it’s important to remind yourself of the good qualities you possess too or dating will hurt your self-esteem and will ultimately make you have a harder time out there in the dating world. Remember that rejection isn’t always about you and try not to identify with it too much. Good luck everyone. "
Told my[f26] fwb[m27] about my feelings,"So I’ve been seeing this guy pretty regularly for the past 3, almost 4 months. We have been hooking up and drinking together about once a week. This started right after I broke up with my ex so I thought of this guy as kind of a rebound...

I’ve started to get feelings for him. He’s never been in a serious relationship at all and never seemed like he wanted to. Which seemed fine with me until a couple weeks ago. He said he’s been thinking more about getting into a relationship with someone because his friends and family think it would be good for him. Last week he started talking to me about having kids together later on in life... asked me to stay over so we could cuddle.. was generally being pretty “coupley” with me. 

I realized after I left his place that I didn’t want him to be with anyone else... so tonight I decided to say something. It didn’t go the way I wanted, he said his crush he had on me previously was gone, and that he has never been a serious relationship kinda guy and probably never will be. I tried to say I wasn’t trying to be serious, I just wanted a little something more. And to take some time to think about this and he said he is pretty much decided 

I am pretty hurt by this obviously, but what I came here to say is, don’t ever be afraid to say whatever it is that you are afraid to say. Now I don’t have to wonder what “could have been” with this guy. I’m actually really proud of myself for being brave enough to say how I feel. I would have never done this in the past! 

Life is too short to hold back how you feel. Always always tell them. "
"I'm fine on most days but when loneliness hits me, it hits hard.","Damn, it really sucks to be alone when you're craving to hold someone, waking up with someone next to you, someone to make love to, someone to have deep conversations with, someone you know you would go to hell and back for. I feel like have so much love to give but there's no one I can give it to. I could lie to myself and say I'm this independent woman that's strong and doesn't need anyone, and it's not like I'm not, but deep down it's another story. I just miss loving someone."
I miss being excited about someone,What can you do if you’ve lost the ability to like someone because you figure “What’s the point? Odds are against this working out anyway...” 
"For the love of God, ladies, please stop using awful filters on dating profiles that completely change what you look like","So I recently started online dating and like 75% of the women's profiles are oversaturated, airbrushed to hell and back to the point you look like an alien. 

Also, I come across a lot of profiles that have multiple women in all the pictures on the profiles and they don't even say which one is them. Like, what's the point of having 3 or 4 or more people in every photo and not even point out to which one is you?

It's only been a few weeks since I started and the only people to have responded to my messages or sent me one of their own free will are sex workers and bots.

Multiple profiles with the same exact pictures and scammers galore. How is online dating even remotely successful?"
college dating feels hard,i’m a 20 F and the college i go to is mostly girls and it feels like all the guys already have girlfriends :/ how does one go about meeting someone if i’m always busy with work/classes and an introvert?? i am also horrible at flirting hahah
Please take things slow.,"No matter how much you like this person, no matter how much you feel they might be the one, take things slow - including sex - truth is you’re so in love it blurs your mental clarity and you make dumb decisions. And you dont see it until after it all crashes and burns. Maybe things wouldnt have worked out anyways but I would rather feel like I did all the right things than feel like I rushed into it and ruined a potentially good relationship. It will be worth it. Either you realize you’re not right for each other before you make any commitments and get more attached or it works out and you’re even more sure its the right person. I know there’s people who get married 2 months after meeting and they’re together for ever but more likely than not that is not going to happen."
"M35, single all my life, am I alone?","Hey,

I'm a good-looking Male 35 who have been single my entire life.  Partly because I always had little interest in relationships and mainly because I'm deeply involved in my hobbies. When I was 30 I found out that I have high-functioning autism which explains why I always had difficulties with social interactions, cues and empathy. 

I'm mostly unable to connect with other people on a deeper level. But I can connect deeply with my hobbies: art, music and writing. And I love dogs.

I have been dating but never clicked with anyone. I have also improved socially. But at this point in life, as you get older, I also get lazier dating and I have become comfortable with being alone and with my self.

Sure, I have missed out on love, relationships and sex. But I also have a deep connection with my hobbies.

Just sharing my 2 cents. Anyone who can relate?"
Online dating makes me feel replacable,"Ive tried bumble for a few months now. I went out with a guy i really liked but it didn’t work out, last I heard he was seeing another girl he met on bumble too. I was on bumble and switched to ‘show everyone’ so I got a peek at what profiles guys see. I started swiping and it made me think like ‘this is probably what (guy) did right after we stopped dating’. So I dunno, I’m not hung up on that guy but it made me feel weird. Like how online dating feels so... like its just this ready thing? Go through bad breakup? You can get a rebound by this weekend. 

I know that thats just how the world works now but I cant help but feel insecure. If a guy doesnt like me then he can easily replace me kind of thing.

Edit: I fell asleep and this blew up! Thank you for all the responses and interesting discussion! :) 

And yes that guy was very good looking but an a-hole. A narcissist. He’d get matches but the girls wouldn’t stay very long."
"On a date, what do you think if a guy asks to kiss you?","I (27F)  went on a couple of dates with a guy I met online (30M). I'm really shy and not good with pda at the beginning of dating. In the past, all guys have kind of wanted to rush into pda and kissing.

We hadn't held hands or anything like that but got on really well. At the end of the date, he asked if he could kiss me. I liked him so went for it :p but did wonder.

I'm just curious to know what kind of guy asks, or if this is how things should be...or of he's actually shy as well? Or ladies, how would you react if asked the question?"
How do people cheat when its so hard to get a girl?,"i've been single my whole life. I'm turning 24 in 2 months. I've been contemplating suicide. Life is just not going my way. Nobody is interested in me or pays any attention to me. I'm not ugly or short or fat either. Whenever I tell people i've never been in a relationship or talked to a woman, they become shocked. I've never approached a woman in my life because i am too scared to do it. Its awkward and uncomfortable to me. If I go up to a woman she's probably gonna think I wanna sleep with her and will think of me as a creep. How do other guys attract women? I don't get it. I know I sound like an idiot writing this but I'm just trying to vent."
How do people just keep dating despite all the setbacks?,"I really hope someone responds to this cause I’m genuinely curious and want to hear people’s opinions.


I took a break. Even un joined this thread because I really just wanted to move on with my life.

I ask this because I stopped dating due to insecurities and pitfalls I had personally. I feel that I need to gain my confidence again. I don’t want to project my problems onto someone else nor do I want to be anxious to be exclusive with someone when in reality I should relax and let it be. (I usually do this because I don’t like being one of many women lol but anyhow)

How do you few really just keep going? I used to have that confidence but at the same time I, dating from one person to another kind of made me feel uncomfortable.

I see all the past people I dated finding either happiness in themselves or finding someone stable without freaking out and just enjoying themselves. While I’m happy for them I find myself jealous too.

I’m finding happiness within myself now but I really do have to ask.. how do you get to that point where you aren’t anxious for someone to text back, you aren’t paranoid about never finding anyone, and etc etc?

When does that feeling end?"
Money vs sex?,"I have a question which I hope it won't offend anyone. I'm honestly wondering if people think and feel the same.

Girls get offended by guys who sexualize them and who talk to them about how sexy they are and speak about their bodies and what they want to do to them, etc... Especially at an early stage.

I met once a very beautiful lady online and among first questions she asked me is, whether I'm renting or owning a house, which was totally random and off topic. Also others ask whether I have a car or not and similar questions.

I want to hear from both guys and girls, isn't this offensive as well? Trying to figure out how much am I worth from first day? Or is it just me?"
Victory in a grocery store and a date the same night,"(31 F). Did my typical grocery shopping on the weekend. I needed a new pillow, so I was looking around and ran into a guy. He asked me questions about memory foam and air mattresses. He was going on a trip with some friends. 

I made conversation and kind of threw out a vague “Oh are you going with your wife/gf?” Since he was older he caught on to what I was doing. He asked me why I asked. I told him he was attractive. I didn’t expect him to ask for my number immediately after. Never in my life has this ever happened. I feel very proud of myself. 

Not going to lie I was a bit nervous as I just met him and didn’t know much. We ended up going on a nice date to get some food and go see a movie. He touched me the majority of the movie. It felt so nice to actually have affection. (My last relationship had no affection and was very verbally abusive) 

We ended up kissing at the end of the night. I text him as a courtesy to let him know I had a good time and to give him a compliment. He did text back. I’m not going to read to much into this as I know how dating is now. 

We both aren’t seeking a relationship, but I do eventually want one just not anytime soon. 

Regardless of the outcome I’m very happy it happened. (I’m a pretty positive person, but my assumptions will always go to “Yeah that’s gonna be it.”) 

I’m trying my best to play it kool and not stress if I don’t hear from him at all, but I don’t want to come off as uninterested. Should I just lay low and not text anymore until I hear something? 

Another thing ladies. Just go for it. If you get rejected oh well. Or you might be surprised. After years of off and on OLD I told myself I would never do it again. I’m glad I stuck to it. 

Edit-Thanks for gold! You guys are awesome. Love ya all! ❤️

Update 1-He never texted today. :( It’s all good though! Small victories and just means I’m capable of doing something like that again. :) will update if it changes. "
"One of my most beautiful, kindest friends recently said ""I'm just not the kind of girl that gets approached, and that's ok"" and my heart fucking BROKE. Fuck every person that made her believe she's not X or Y ""enough"" for people to want to know her. You're not worthy of her.","This is a post I saw from a female (Girl A) I follow on Twitter. I wholeheartedly disagreed that guys where *actively* making her friend (Girl B) feel this way and told her so. I asked for more context and she (Girl A) responded ""(Girl B) has to be proactive & go out of her way to ""chase"" more than she should bc no one will ""chase"" her.

This is where I almost lost my shit because the reality for tons of guys is a lot worse including a few of my best friends. A lot of my friends are basically invisible to women to the point there they've stopped trying all together. Lets just say some of these guys aren't what society deem as attractive and I'm assuming Girl B also falls into this category. The difference is I wouldn't blame all the women for not being attractive to me or my mates. You can't be angry at people who aren't attract to you.

A lot of females agreed with the Girl A initial post and my male friends agreed with me. So what do the men and women of reddit think? I sincerely do feel for Girl B but it's not right to blame all men in my opinion.

&#x200B;

TL:DR - Girl blames society/men for not hitting on her friend enough"
"Average guys are screwed, the numbers are working against us. But there's hope--I think it's all about self-love."," 

I saw this on the showerthoughts reddit and it's absolutely true: ""Tinder is the self esteem booster app for average looking woman and self esteem destroyer for average looking men"". That's true not just about Tinder but online/offline dating in general. If you are a minority guy double worse--this isn't whining. It's reality backed by research (look up Dataclysm and Chris Rudder's research on OKCupid that was publicized on FiveThirtyEight, Time, etc) . Thing is it's what people *say*, and what they *actually do* are different. And that applies very much to dating too, especially as there will be exceptions that give advice based on their one special situation without acknowledging general trends OR they will fall into the ""do as I say, not as I do"" trap. 

Online dating is basically tall white guys or non-white guys with supermodel looks getting matching and meeting 80% of the women.

Now that said: That's the game. It's what attracts women initially fair enough, we're not entitled to any one specific person. People are attracted to what they are, so I don't begrudge women for being into tall white guys. Now this is not about women-hating, that's a dark place to go into. Biology and social norms/preferences are hard to overcome.

So I think we average, not super extroverted guys need to realize we have to approach this differently. My advice or 2 cents is to change the approach and just work on the basics:

\- **Gym** (because you'll look better AND it's good for you)

\- **Wear clothes that fit**

\- **Find one or two hobbies that you like, and go all in unapologetically**. It's easy to get insecure about your intersets--for example, I'm not into NFL or UFC at all. IDGAF about either, and it can make one seem meek when in the company of the boys chatting about it. But oh well.

\- **Be a little more social than your comfort leve**l. Just a little more. No need to become a hi-fiving woooo\~! bro at the bar. Just means maybe saying yes to more invites. Inviting someone you haven't before to do something social.

I think doing these four things can help us average guys just be more happy and comfortable with ourselves. Because being miserable or waffling in self-pity or having this resentment in us then becomes a reinforcing cycle. I think the problem is we compare ourselves too much, and also we set ourselves up to fail by playing a game that's not for us. Perhaps we should just optimize ourselves, and work at self-love, it might help our dating life."
So I flirted for the first time,"First sorry for my english, I'm working on it.

I'm a 22 year old man. I used to spend my time at home, doing solo activities without really thinking about socializing with people in the real world. I just had fun on my own because of trust issues towards people.
A friend of mine invited me a few times to hang out with his friends at bars in Paris. The first times I was kind of scared of what could happen because I don't speak that much and didn't want to spend the night being quiet therefore I used to find BS last-second excuses not to go.

 But then I've been to Iceland on a trip with the class (3rd year and about to get my licence degree). We had nothing else to do beside going to bars at night and it drastically changed my point of view. Why would I spend week-ends at home when I can have fun with people ?

So this week I asked my friend if they were planning on going out this week-end and he invited me to come meet his buddies. 
I made the effort of talking to everybody and was quickly integrated in the group (despite not talking much nowadays, I was the complete opposite before so it wasn't that hard afterall). 
At one point this girl joined us and I immediately started to talk to her, asking questions about what she does in life, what she likes etc. Turned out she has a very interesting point of view on some things in life so we discussed for about an hour on deep topics. 
I noticed we had a lot of eye contact when talking, and while sitting, she was replacing herself closer to me from time to time so I didn't miss opportunities to slightly compliment her and imply we should meet again. I really surprised myself at how direct and stressless I was at flirting. I now think it's natural for all men but sometimes we just convince ourselves its not. 
At the end I offered her a cocktail, she said she was very thankfull and we kept talking a bit. Maybe 10 minutes before she lives I asked her number and told her we should meet soon again and she blushed and didnt reply.
What amazes me is how I kept control of myself and how things have gone perfectly smoothly. Really it's no big deal at all. 

This morning she sent me that she "" spent a good night yesterday :3 "". I'm think about inviting her in Paris again next saturday but honestly I don't make it a big deal at all once again. 
In fact we didn't talk at all about relationships and what she expects because 1) I didn't even think of questioning her about that 2) I think it would be too early anyway. I don't even know what I want with her or if I' ready to date someone. What is your advice on what i should do next ?

TLDR : I've never dated girls, never really been to bars talking with strangers, never flirted. But I somehow managed to flirt a bit with a girl I met there. She looks interested, gave me her number and now I'm thinking about asking her out again. I dont foresee any relationship for now but I'm curious where it could lead us.  What would you advise to do next ?
For the guys who think it's hard, just drink a bit its a good way to stay calm and keep control of the situation. The flirting process is easy when the girl is receptive, it even encourages to go deeper in the process."
"Recently broke up with my gf of 2 years, how do you stop thinking of all the good memories?","I’m devastated, we both are, but she thinks it’s the best move for her to focus on herself.  I’m awful at letting people go and I’ve faked it for the last couple of weeks but today I just woke up and everything I see reminds me of her and the good times we had.
I’m just lost, everyone tries to give me different advice and what I should do but I don’t even know anymore.  I don’t want to move on but I think it’s best thing that I should do, but I don’t know how I can move on mentally.

EDIT:  Thank you guys so much for commenting and letting me know your experiences.  I’m at work right now but reading each of your advices and own experiences really genuinely put tears in my eyes.  I hope you all can see this edit and know that I appreciate you all.  When I get off work later tonight I’ll reply to everyone of you and thank you but for now this is all I can do. M

I’m still hurting but it definitely helps to know there’s so many people that’s been through what I’m going through right now.  Thank you."
The slow fade is 10x worse than ghosting,"Both are obviously annoying and rude as hell but at least when you get ghosted you pretty much know that things are done after a few days of no contact. The slow fade leaves you on the hook for weeks or even months and you often don’t know for sure if they’re losing interest or are genuinely just busy. Asking about the diminished contact can make you feel clingy and insecure, and the only way to know what’s actually going on is to wait for them to eventually cut you off completely.

It sucks. "
Cute dates,"Edit: please read the entire paragraph before commenting, Its not a long read. I feel like some people halfway read the first sentence and comment, completely missing the point.


Do people even like cute dates anymore? I’m NOT talking about spending a lot of money in a fancy restaurant that’s gonna cost $100. Dates like ice skating, which costs $15 for 2 people (on Groupon, live within your means, don’t break your bank if you don’t have to). Going to a museum, or to the park or the beach when the weather is nice, depending on where you live. I can’t speak for men, because I’m a girl, and I don’t really know if you guys even like cute dates, but I know a lot of ladies who would love this type of effort, but it’s hard to wade through the people (men and women) who just want to have sex and go. 

There are lots of cheap, or free venues for dates, why don’t we take advantage of it? "
I have a boyfriend!,"After being single for my entire life (24 years) I met someone who makes every other guy I went out with feel like nothing. I broke “dating rules” and because of it, I met the most amazing guy. He says how lucky he feels to have met me, but I’m the lucky one here ❤️"
I (31F) finally got a second date! After none for years!,"I just wanted to express my joy. See I've been online dating for over a year and been on at least half a dozen dates. Not a single one of those resulted in a second date. One guy even came to visit me from three hours away, then ghosted me. I couldn't figure out what was so wrong with me. Another guy kissed me on the first date then abruptly cut things off before a second.... Sigh.

So I still don't know what's wrong with me, but at least one idiot (28M) wants to see me again."
"How long do you date someone before you make it an official relationship (exclusively and/or title of boyfriend or girlfriend, etc)? Or are there certain things that need to happen first?","I’m not asking for advice. Just curious what other people feel on this.

For me (27f) they need to know certain things about my life, meet my nearby family and friends, and our dreams for the future need to be compatible."
Online dating sucks,"Hello, I'm probably only one so stupid and naive here hoping to find serious relationship on online dating sites.

Seriously that hookup standard now makes me sick since 90% of guys who text me only want hookup, only small amount of guys who texted wanted serious relationship but godamnit now people standards are so high on dating sites that it's really hard to find someone you could meet their standards.

And also lot of people are using dating sites just for their ego boost, you get into Russian roulette when you can't stop swiping, it gets kind of addicting game to play, you can't stop swiping and messing with people around since everything there is so easy, you dislike someone you can block or ignore them, you can play this endlessly, you are getting master of playing mind games with others.

I hope I'm not only one with bad experiences here. :/"
Why it's okay to be single.,"TL;DR: Social media's a lie, your singleness does not define you, and you can have a fun life without a SO. 

Look, I've been there. Your friends are all going out on dates, posting on social media about their SO, and seeing all the comments from people about how they're ""relationship goals."" Meanwhile you're spending your Friday night on your own (again...), feeling lonely, and binge watching the newest season of Arrow on Netflix (no? Just me? Ok...) 

You want a relationship, but can't find someone no matter how hard you try. The girl you thought was infatuated with you is ""too busy"" to go out. The guy who was flirting with you at the party won't even return your text. I've been there, and I know how it feels to want a relationship so bad when it seems nobody will give you a chance. 

I know coming from a stranger on the internet, this may mean nothing, but here's a few lessons I had to learn to be content with being single.

- Social media is a BIG FAT LIE. The whole point of social media is to make your life look better than it actually is. Those pictures of your friend at the beach cuddling with her ripped boyfriend? Those pics of your bro at the club grinding on his hot girlfriend? All lies. Life ain't a Disney movie. Couples have the same problems we do (maybe even more). Just because someone posts a cute picture with a caption like, ""I love you to the moon and back ❤"" doesn't mean that they have a happy relationship. Once you realize it's all just a show, it becomes much easier to enjoy being single. 


- Your singleness does not define you. Sure, the constant questions from your friends and family about, ""When are you gonna start dating someone?"" may have you thinking otherwise. And that's your first mistake. Letting the opinion of someone (even if it's someone you love) pressure you into finding a relationship will only lead to more problems down the road. If you want a relationship because you think it'll make your life better, by all means do so. If you want a relationship just so Grandma Bethany will stop nagging you about it, reexamine yourself and find out who/what you are doing this for. Life gets a lot easier when you just stop caring what others think.


- Being single doesn't mean you can't have a fun and fulfilling life. Sure, it would be nice to have someone to watch the new Mission Impossible movie with, but that doesn't mean I can't watch it on my own. 

Story time: One time I asked this girl to go see Justice League. She said she'd ""think about it"" and that she'd get an answer to me soon. Being the idiot I was at the time, I waited for her answer. 2 freaking weeks, until she decided to cancel it all together. That weekend, I decided, ""Forget it. I've been waiting for this movie all year, I'm seeing it with or without her."" And while the movie was nothing to write home about, I still had a fun time that I probably wouldn't have had if I was with a girl who didn't give a crap about me. 

Once you drill these 3 guidelines into your head, you'll realize that being single is NOT a curse. Sure, a relationship would be great, but being single doesn't mean you're a failure at life or that no one will ever love you (2 things I've thought a lot about before...). It's simply a fact about yourself, like what TV show you like or what's your favorite color. It doesn't determine how ""socially superior"" you are. It just means you're free and down to mingle. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Ladies mostly, does anyone else refrain from being the one to text first to seem like you’re playing it cool? Guys weigh in too.","I’ve realized that I avoid texting guys I like first as an attempt to not seem clingy. I feel like women are conditioned now to play down their feelings because the worst thing we could be seen as is being clingy or needy, or showing that we’re interested because men like “a chase”. I realize I have possibly sabotaged many texting stages with men in the past who may have been more interested than I assumed because I wanted to seem cool and carefree, but probably came off as uninterested. I’ll be the one to text first now, but I still like when a guy is mostly the first one to reach out. 

Maybe I am overthinking, but I’m just wondering if anyone else relates?"
"[21 male] Do you ever just wish you had someone to have sex with and hold hands with that you weren’t worried about? Like, god that’s a dumb flair but on god I just vibe to music at like 2 am and wish I had a girl with me to shoot the shit and just hold yk?","I feel like I find it hard to find or maybe I’m just drinking too much tonight but I just want someone to vibe with, someone I just mad respect who gets it but I feel like with my job that’s hard, plus living in a new state and all that like this place is nice so far but... yeah, lol jesus that was wack😂"
IM GONNA TELL MY CRUSH I LIKE HIM THIS FRIDAY,"Im (15F) gonna tell my crush, who is also my best friend, that I like him. I’m extremely nervous. I’ve never told anyone I’ve liked them before. But I feel like the time is right, and I really want to do it and get some closure.

Im gonna write a little confession on a piece of paper, which I’m gonna fold into a paper crane. Then on Friday, I’m gonna give him the paper crane as we part ways, and tell him to unfold it after school.

Ahhhh. I’m so scared, but I’m so excited at the same time. I’m trying not to get my hopes up though, just in case. But nonetheless, I still can’t believe I’m actually gonna do it!!!!!!

Edit: I posted an update on how it went!"
"What would you do if on your first date your date calls you at the time you were supposed to meet and told you they would be 30 minutes late, then 30 minutes later texted you and said they would be even more late?","This happened to me over the weekend, after the first call I jokingly told her she was paying for dinner because we were going to dinner and movies. Then after the next time she texted me she’d be late I told told her again and she said “if you’re serious I don’t have to come.” I then told her I’m serious and she hung up on me. She then texted me paragraphs telling me how I was being a dick for disrespecting her for being a little late"
How much time to reply do you give people these days? How patient are you until you move on?,"In a time where people are constantly busy and occupied with all manner of things, how much time do you give people these days until you just move on?
 
I had a case recently of somebody who really only replied every 3-4 days, it was impossible to get a conversation flow going. They seemed nice enough but if they dont make time to get to know me, I think things are doomed from the start."
The best part of dating,"The best part of dating is when she embraces you in a hug that lets you know that she's not going anywhere. After the 2nd, 3rd 4th or 5th date, however long it takes. With my last 15 month relationship it was after the second date. We exited the restaurant and she immediately wrapped her hands around my bicep as we were walking to my car. She hugged my arm tight and put her forehead against my chest.

&#x200B;

That's the best part. The games are over. It's just two people being their authentic selves from then on. Then you know that you've accomplished something unique and have something that could be very  important."
"“We hook up because we have no social skills. We have no social skills because we hook up.” (A really great read on current dating culture, people having less sex, declining social skills)","The Atlantic just published a great article on why younger people are having less sex. It goes beyond sex, though, and looks at the entire picture of how people are socializing nowadays, the problems with online dating and why they don't deliver, and how that contributes to the decline of not just sex, but basic social skills and connection overall. For anyone who is frustrated with not being able to meet anyone, I think the read will help you feel a little better.

I'm linking it in the comments since I can't link it here, but there's a lot interesting tidbits about online dating in particular such as:

>In all dating markets, apps appear to be most helpful to the highly photogenic. As Emma, a 26-year-old virgin who sporadically tries her luck with online dating, glumly told me, “Dating apps make it easy for hot people—who already have the easiest time.” Christian Rudder, a co-founder of OkCupid (one of the less appearance-centric dating services, in that it encourages detailed written profiles), reported in 2009 that the male users who were rated most physically attractive by female users got 11 times as many messages as the lowest-rated men did; medium-rated men received about four times as many messages. The disparity was starker for women: About two-thirds of messages went to the one-third of women who were rated most physically attractive. A more recent study by researchers at the University of Michigan and the Santa Fe Institute found that online daters of both genders tend to pursue prospective mates who are on average 25 percent more desirable than they are—presumably not a winning strategy.  
>  
>So where does this leave us? Many online daters spend large amounts of time pursuing people who are out of their league. Few of their messages are returned, and even fewer lead to in-person contact. At best, the experience is apt to be bewildering (*Why are all these people swiping right on me, then failing to follow through?*). But it can also be undermining, even painful. Emma is, by her own description, fat. She is not ashamed of her appearance, and purposefully includes several full-body photos in her dating profiles. Nevertheless, men persist in swiping right on her profile only to taunt her—when I spoke with her, one guy had recently ended a text exchange by sending her a gif of an overweight woman on a treadmill.  
>  
>An even bigger problem may be the extent to which romantic pursuit is now being cordoned off into a predictable, prearranged online venue, the very existence of which makes it harder for *anyone*, even those not using the apps, to extend an overture in person without seeming inappropriate. What a miserable impasse.

&#x200B;

>He had better luck with Tinder than the other apps, but it was hardly efficient. He figures he swiped right—indicating that he was interested—up to 30 times for every woman who also swiped right on him, thereby triggering a match. But matching was only the beginning; then it was time to start messaging. “I was up to over 10 messages sent for a single message received,” he said. In other words: Nine out of 10 women who matched with Simon after swiping right on him didn’t go on to exchange messages with him. This means that for every 300 women he swiped right on, he had a conversation with just one.  
>  
>At least among people who don’t use dating apps, the perception exists that they facilitate casual sex with unprecedented efficiency. In reality, unless you are exceptionally good-looking, the thing online dating may be best at is sucking up large amounts of time. As of 2014, when Tinder last released such data, the average user logged in 11 times a day. Men spent 7.2 minutes per session and women spent 8.5 minutes, for a total of about an hour and a half a day. Yet they didn’t get much in return. Today, the company says it logs 1.6 billion swipes a day, and just 26 million matches. And, if Simon’s experience is any indication, the overwhelming majority of matches don’t lead to so much as a two-way text exchange, much less a date, much less sex.

(20F) Is saving myself for marriage dooming me to being alone?,"I am an introvert who is beyond intimidated by the dating world. I am so scared to step out of my shell, and this is mainly because I have made the decision to save myself for marriage. I am scared that if I open myself to people, they will reject me for this reason. I worry about leading guys on, or that they would view me as a prude without really getting to know me first. I had one relationship before, and now feel ready to try again. Friends have suggested I try dating apps, but I worry that it is rude/irresponsible of me to go on these apps knowing full well that I would never hook-up with someone. Would that make me a bad person? 

 Is it ok to go on dating apps if I want to abstain from sex? 

If dating apps aren't the way to go, does anyone have other advice for me on how to get myself out there?"
I hide or unmatch people from dating apps if I don’t get response within a day or two. Saves my time and overthinking thoughts.,"I don’t know what you guys do usually, but i delete or hide people from dating apps if I don’t get response back within a day or two. It saves my time for overthinking or being ghosted. I just move to another one. It’s 21st century, and we are always with our smart phone. There is no fukin way you are too busy to response someone back within a day or two  if you are interested. Cuz if people are really interested in you, they will definitely make some time for you and response you back. 

It has saved my lots of time from overthinking.

Edit: I mean to say only those people who I have been talking for a day and don’t get response within a day or two. I delete those people right away who I don’t even get response back for my first message. Why the fuck you match if you don’t wanna talk? Just swipe left and don’t waste our fukin time"
"I think I found a keeper, and I dont have anyone to tell about it.","I left my abusive ex a few months ago. I felt trapped and like I couldn't get out, so I just packed up and left one day. I felt lonely and joined a social/dating app. I just wanted to talk to people again, since I don't have really any friends. 

I got so many messages, my app was crashing. So many creeps. I messaged a few back, but it either got weird or didn't go anywhere. But one guy just asked me why I was on the app. I said I was lonely, and he asked to Snapchat. 

I expected him to ask for nudes and all that, but I was surprised when he didn't. He was ice fishing with his brothers and it was Christmas Eve. I like fishing, so we got to talking. 

We talked 24/7 (except when we were sleeping) every day after that.  Snapchat and text every minute were awake. He calls me on my work break every evening. We have soooo much in common. I'm super outdoorsy and he is too. Plus he's cute as hell and sooo sweet lol. 

He's in the next state over, almost 5 hours away. But I jumped in my car and headed over there for a whole weekend two weeks after we started talking. 

I had the time of my life. We went ice fishing for 12 hours, and I had a blast. We went back to his place and smoked weed, and he made me amazing chicken enchiladas. We had sex, which was mind blowing. I had never had sex so good lol. We watched Netflix and cuddled until we fell asleep. 

He came to my place this weekend. I took him fishing on my favorite lake. We hot boxed his fishing shack, and had some risky sex. A warden came to check licenses, and we ended up both getting tickets for paraphernalia. Oops. Went back to my cabin. The generator blew up (we planned on watching movies) so we played cards under the gas lights and drank beer. Pushed the couches together by the wood stove and cuddled all night in our makeshift bed. 

He handled our shit situation so well, and just made the best of it. 

He asked me if I wanted to make things official while we were waiting for our tickets that night, I said yeah lol. 

I'm falling hard guys. He's so nice and respectful toward me, unlike anyone I've been with before. He met my dad, and left a great impression. We share so many of the same interests. Made so many plans to go camping, hiking, hunting, and fishing. Its early yet, and I've been drinking tonight, but holy cow am I hoping this works out. 

Best of luck to you all, though. I am happy as hell.

Edit: Forgot to add, we both got tickets with the same mandatory court date. So we have a ""court date"" date now🙃"
9 months ago she cheated on me while my mother was dying in the hospital.,"4 years after a bad breakup I finally found my next girlfriend. I've  never been with anyone this amazing to me in my life. She's cute, smart,  a very hard worker. She wants to do things with me that no other girl  I've never been with wanted to do like ride bikes in a different town  every single weekend. She cooked with me and we never argued. I thought  this one was going to be the one. I couldn't imagine any other woman  being the mother of my children.

Almost a year of seeing each other and countless adventures later my  mom's health started to decline. My mother recently was taken to the  hospital when she had collapsed in Goodwill while shopping. They've  given me a timeline of when they expect her to pass away now. This was a  couple of weeks ago.

The day my mom was admitted to the hospital I rushed from work to go  see her. When I got there she said hey and then started to cough up a  lot of blood. It was all over her hospital gown and face. This is not  how you want to see your mother. I was quickly rushed out of the room by  an orderly so they could work on my mom. In a panic and with the  childhood death of my father fresh in my mind at this moment, I reached  out to my girlfriend. Her responses were short. The phone call sent  straight to voice mail. No worries. She's busy. She's a social worker  and they are always busy.

Over the next couple of weeks her not reciprocating any affection but  still allowing me to buy her gifts and work on her landscaping, the  truth finally came out.

Last Saturday I spent the entire day working in her yard. Laying  boarder stones, digging up bushes and planting things. The next day we  were supposed to drive to a neighboring town with our bikes in tow to  ride a rail trail we've never ridden before. I asked if she wanted me to  spend the night at her home or if she wanted to spend the night at mine  so that we could head out early in the morning. She told me that she  wanted to sleep in her own bed alone due to the amount lack of sleep  she's gotten that week. She also said that she was going to eat with her  mom and her mom's house that night then go to bed at home. She would  see me early at my house the next morning.

Sunday morning rolled around and she calls me. Told me the plans had  changed. Said that she had to put all this out there at once that she  had been over at an exboyfriend's house that lives over and hour away  from her that night having a ""beer"". This was the first time that she  had been there in years and they were just catching up on old times. We  weren't going to be able to ride now because her car was vandalized.

[https://i.imgur.com/8cX5V4P.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8cX5V4P.jpg)

[https://i.imgur.com/u9WEVRR.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/u9WEVRR.jpg) [https://i.imgur.com/5z6YdQF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5z6YdQF.jpg)

In these pictures is her car in the exboyfriend's driveway. Apparently  a jealous lover of his knew who she was and knew what they were doing  in his house. She swears that they weren't having sex. Even said that  his kids were there and she wouldn't if they were.

Well fast forward a little bit.  I have figured out that she's been there 3  times at least in the past 7 days. She doesn't realize that she has  geolocation turned on and with the EXIF metadata in a selfie she sent  while I was texting her last Wednesday I was able to figure out that she  was in his driveway. She was waiting on him because as soon as he got  there she stopped texting for 2 and a half hours.

Another thing. This person that is attacking her also posted a nasty  message pointing out her lover's and her cheating behavior to her  employer. This post was 6 hours before she was caught there while I was  working with her in her yard. Funny how she hadn't been there in years  but this random person knew she was going there.

Stupid me didn't piece all this together until that day. That day my mom  flat lined. They were able to resuscitate her. My girlfriend or now  exgirlfriend was once again AWOL.

Tomorrow I'm going to dump her after writing a letter explaining in  detail how I figured out she was lying and how bad this hurt me during  one of the worst points of my life. Right now I need someone. I have a  very small support group. My mom will be my last family member in this  country I can talk to. When she goes I'll be pretty much alone.

I lost what I had once thought was the love of my life and my mother around the same time.

This is the saddest period of my life and I feel like she's broken a good man.

So now she has moved on. Gets to date her ex and have sex with him. Hang out and be loved by his family. While I got to go watch my mom die alone."
"Asked the girl I've been seeing for a month out last week and she said she'd ""let me know her schedule"". Well I knew what that meant so I just disengaged. Lo and behold, 3 days later she actually texted me her schedule. Do I have to marry this woman now?","I'm actually shook. It's like finding a damn unicorn out there.

P.S. She was busy this week but said next week might work. 

P.P.S. shoutout to the people who think I was actually going to marry this girl over this. I was just pleasantly surprised she bothered to follow through with this. 99% of the time, as I've seen in real life and on Reddit, ""I'll let you know"" is the gentle way to ghost someone "
Sick of being single? Offend someone.,"&#x200B;

(this is written as an encouragement, not as insult or put down)

&#x200B;

Through the recent tragic suicide of my ex fiance of 8 years (and me essentially becoming a widower before being a husband, at age 36), in which during the final minutes of his life, he has skype video called me — a call that lasted a full 90 minutes... from 7790 miles away... in 1080p... not asking me to save him.. but wanted my blessing for his final journey in his 3rd attempt after suffering from 4 years of depression... with a plate of charcoal burning on the side and more than a dozen sleeping pills already ingested...  — it got me thinking :

&#x200B;

why did he trust me in dying when many others don’t even have someone who ***ever*** have trusted them in living?

&#x200B;

My body is mediocre, face is acceptable, earn in low 6-figures but nowhere close to being a 1%-er, and definitely not the nicest person around. Am I that lucky, or is everyone else so unlucky ?

&#x200B;

For perpetually single folks, ranging from the uber hot very successful types, good enough all around but lower self esteem, circuit party queens, to so-so quality guys, I think I finally found the common theme that links them, which also points to each of those solving the wrong problem, and the solution I'm proposing doesn’t involve any part of physical appearance or money either —

&#x200B;

**THEIR WILL TO TAKE A STAND**

&#x200B;

The one common theme among this vast array of friends and acquaintances is that, driven by their desire to either maximize friend gain or minimize friend/potential candidate lost, all have a personality that prevents them from willing to take a stand ... on anything.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand doesn’t have to be on political topics. Doesn't have to be as polarizing as #RESISTANCE vs. #MAGA. e.g. Publicly declaring you like Benz over BMW is taking a stand. Saying you like Korean cuisine but not Japanese ones is taking a stand. Packers over Eagles is taking a stand. But saying you like everything and don’t hate anything isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

Taking a stand must involve prioritizing one item over another, and not hiding the preference when others inquire about it. Secretly loving Star Trek over Star Wars but telling others you love both or you have no pref isn’t taking a stand.

&#x200B;

But that also entails the single risk all of the groups appear unwilling to bear — the risk of offending ANYONE. If u like A over B and make the preference public, people who like B may not understand why, and thus may get offended, however unreasonably that may be.

&#x200B;

So, this group of people, fear of losing any potential partying buddies or dating candidates, would present themselves as friendly-to-all, care-free, opinion-free (and maybe even cage-free), while punting all decision-making to someone else (deciding something on behalf of others is also taking a stand, even something as basic as like deciding a place for lunch) It goes back to them being single... because what exactly is dating?

&#x200B;

**Dating is someone willing to take a stand...** ***ON YOU*****.**

&#x200B;

Someone willing to pick you. Someone willing to shoulder the risk of offending his friends who don’t like because they believe you are important, and believe you are worth it. But it has to be reciprocal and mutual - they expect that you also would've taken a stand on him in the process.

&#x200B;

The obvious question to ask is — why would anyone be willing to take a stand on you when all they see is someone unwilling to take a stand on anything? Not just something, but **ANYTHING**, and ***EVERYTHING***.

&#x200B;

Many of them kept thinking others found theirs due to shear. dumb. luck.

Some thought their body isn’t hot and buff enough.

Some thought they’re not rich enough.

Some thought they’re not nice enough.

&#x200B;

So they all waste time solving the wrong problem, and doubling down when the solution doesn't seem to have yielded returns (in their minds : ""....yet""). But it boils down to — maybe, they aren’t principled enough to have principles. Start with taking a stand on everyday life options, like a car, a ski resort, an island in Hawaii, a book recommended by Oprah, a game console (yes, i'm the nut job who loves Nintendo Switch), take the risk of potentially offending one of your 4500 facebook ""friends"" and 6000 IG ""followers"",

&#x200B;

...and maybe, one day, someone is willing to take a stand on you."
"Why do men on dating sites insist on meeting straight away, and usually hiking?? (I'm F)","Due to personal preference and anxiety, I prefer to talk to people for at least a short while on dating sites (Tinder, OkCupid, POF, etc.) before meeting up. I've seen this labeled as ""pen pal-ing"" and is apparently a common frustration for men seeking women. I've also noticed a common first activity suggestion is always hiking, which I'm going to be honest, is the last place I want to go with someone I've just met, especially a man. That's how you get murdered. 

&#x200B;

The way I see it, I'm feeling out their personality to see if they're worth meeting, and to not go hiking partially because I don't like it very much, but also because I don't want to go into the woods with someone I've never met before. But apparently, this is a huge annoyance. 

&#x200B;

Men of Reddit who are on dating sites, what's your guys' take on this?



Edit: Wow this got way more attention than I thought it would!!! I just wanted to clarify a few points I see being repeated. 

1. I do live in the PNW, so hiking is a common activity here, but with that said, even on the most populated trails, there are still lulls in the by-traffic that leave plenty of opportunities for harm to be done. Not to mention nowhere on my profile have I mentioned nature nor do I have any nature pictures. Hiking is not an activity I particularly enjoy. 

2. When I say I want to feel out their personality, I dont mean weeks or months. I mean a few days of solid conversation to try to make sure they're not just looking for a hookup, and to make sure our personalities are somewhat compatible enough to be across from the table, bar, whatever. I dont want to be pen pals for months. That's boring. But I dont want the third message out of the gate to be ""let's go out"" or ""can I have your number."" Give me just a half a second!

Thanks for all your replies!!"
Dating advice for women (Male perspective),"1. Exclusively having pictures from your neck up sends most of us a message that you are uncomfortable with your body.

2. Using the same pose in every picture equates to you being a basic beezy to many men.

3. Duck lips are still not attractive to a lot of men.

4. If you open the conversation on us, you'll set yourself far apart from the pack in some of our eyes.

5. If you can kick our ass, it only makes some of us like you more.

6. A lot of guys still think y'all want that Disney Princess stuff to happen to you, and see it as an abysmal task.

7. We have no idea what you're thinking of EVER, we just get lucky with our guesses sometimes.

8. If we ask about food, at least say something that has a broad scope, sometimes i.e. Mexican food, Chinese, etc. Or anything better than idc

9. Some men like it when you can talk shit with them.

10. Lastly, don't be a starfish.

Cheers!"
I think my boyfriend has a crush and it bothers me.,"So I have been with my boyfriend about a year now and I've become increasingly uncomfortable with one of his sister's friends. Now I have nothing against her personally but I have the feeling my boyfriend has a crush on her. Now him having a crush wouldn't be a problem if it was a celebrity, not someone he knows in real life. He tries to deny it but I don't believe him. I tried bringing it up again today and he said ""what if I did? Would you be upset?"" Then he saw me getting upset and saying I'm the one who he should love. He says he loves me and that he doesn't have a crush on her, that he was speaking hypothetically. He said over and over that he doesn't have a thing for her. 


He's a friendly guy and he was upfront about the friendliness before we were together,  but hes always giggly around her. Like sometimes I just want to hide myself and be preoccupied on my phone because I can't stand it. Went to a yard sale yesterday where things were given away for free. He found a half dry erase/bulletin board he said he wanted for his room.. then later on he decides to give it to his sister, who supposedly doesn't want it and he gave it to the friend instead. Went to Dollar Tree and one of the things he buys is dry erase markers he gave to her.. he didn't buy me anything. His parents also said they heard him ranting outside about what I told him and said it was sad that I don't trust him and that he comes home to me. I have suspected for a while that he's been into her. He said in the past he was interested in her because she likes the music he likes, but that he didn't pursue her because it was his sister's friend. 

It's not even just the way he acts around her, it's social media too. He's always ""hearting"" or ""liking "" her photos even when I've told him the hearts bother me. He did it as recently as last night. He says this is how he is showing support to others, especially as she is a fitness guru. 

Now please before I suspect that I'll be told I'm being possessive,  insecure etc.. understand where I'm coming from. I'm very outspoken and don't hide how I feel. I pay attention and I'm just not sure how to not let this bother me. Am I looking into this too much? I know bringing it up again will annoy him."
Accepting the inevitable,"Hey guys im new here. Im currently 31 years old, male. I can't remember the last time ive been on a dating or held hands with a girl. It just seems to me that i guess there isn't a soulmate for me. Anger and depression overwelmed me at times, and i feel like im on my end link... I tried and almost killed myself by wrecking my car into a wall. But i guess something still wants me here. I dont feel like it.."
"""I don't date men with receding hairlines.""","[26/m] I was told this tonight by someone to whom I had grown close. I told her how I felt, and this was the response I got.

Spare me the ""she isn't the kind of woman you want"" or ""not every woman is that way"" etc. I've heard it before. I know. 

I'm just venting the pain of having one of my greatest insecurities externally validated. Wow this hurts.

EDIT: Thank you everyone who have given me words of encouragement and advice. For the record, I buzz my head down to 1/4"" regularly, am involved in cross-fit, and make an effort to look nice most days.

I am always looking for ways to improve myself though so your tips are welcome and appreciated."
"If you’re on a dating app, and you leave your bio blank, you’re automatically getting swiped left","You’re basically asking people to base their opinion solely on your looks. I mean I know thats what Online dating is, to an extent. Don’t you have hobbies? Don’t you wanna tell people what you’re looking for? Don’t you want people to know at least SOMETHING about you???"
Am I screwed for the next (1? 2?) years as a single person due to corona?,"I’m looking for a serious relationships. I don’t like dating apps and I’m convinced that it’s tough to find a guy who wants anything serious on there. Plus I’m not super attracted to anyone I’ve seen on the dating apps. I’ve never been in a serious relationship due to wanting to focus on school,  but now I’m getting lonely. The best “relationships” I’ve had (no matter how short lived they were) were with people I met in real life. Do you think i should throw in the towel and consider myself single for however long corona is around?  Am I doomed for the next year or two? Does anyone have any success stories of meeting your SO during corona? Brownie points if you met them outside of a dating app."
How do you deal with knowing about a partners history?,"Some people care about their partners history some dont. I wish I was the kind that didnt, but I cant.  As soon as I start to like someone, the thought of them being with someone else makes me feel physically sick. I've dealt with this before too, and it makes me want to ask questions and pry, even though I have no business knowing and the answer might hurt me. The stupid thing is I have a history too, obviously, and it doesn't seem to bother anyone I've seen. I've been trying to not think about it, and for the most part it works, but when it comes to things like discussing that we should both get STD tested, it forces me to think about it and it hurts.

Edit: I have to say that I was originally hesitant to post this, because I was worried about being called all sorts of negative things.  Well, the responses have been overwhelmingly supportive and non judgemental, so thank you guys for that. I think this is a symptom of a deeper issue, one that I will be looking into getting help for, thanks.

Edit 2: this thread has really opened my eyes to the fact that this isnt about the actual sex as much as it is about insecurity and mental health in general. I think I'm going to focus on getting that under control, regardless of how things turn out with the person I'm seeing now. Thanks everyone that contributed!"
On a first date I think both parties should share expenses,I’m actually old fashioned I do like to pay for what I do with a lady on a date but after recently going on a date with someone who I thought was vibing with me pretty well and we had done a few things we started with frozen yogurt and then coffee at Starbucks and had some drinks and an appetizer after. She did say she wanted to pay for something so we went and bought a bottle of liquor to have a few shots together that she paid for but directly after she says she has to leave never opening the bottle. I still had a great time and texted her later Saying as much and her response was ..glad you had a good time . I’m pretty sure their won’t be a second date and looking back she didn’t even offer the tip at the restaurant. I now think if the woman decides early on the date that she isn’t seeing that spark and she decided to continue with the date anyway she should at least legit offer to go half or at least chip in. Dates aren’t cheap anymore and every failed date you pay for gives you less opportunity to spend time and money on someone that’s actually interested. What are your thoughts on this ? 
Getting bored of explaining yourself on dates?,"Dates with different woman, to find that  perfect one.. is anyone else’s just tired of repeating the same thing to everyone?
“ I work at so and so.. my hobbies are so and so.. my fav shows are ...” that repetition gets annoying and boring!! It’s so much work and effort having to repeat it all haha "
I seriously considered driving 6 hours to see a guy who communicates with me via Snapchat,"Who
- never asked for my number 
- only hits me up at night 
- joked that I come get a hotel room near him and I SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED CUZ I AM THAT RIDICULOUS 

advice on how to gain self respect back after that act of stupidity 

Oh and when I told him I was gonna come he goes “don’t force it if you can’t” 

It took his passive rejection for me to realize how stupid I was being

*this is someone I in fact know, not a catfish lol"
Am I making things more difficult for myself by only wanting sex while in a relationship?,"So I am fairly new to dating and need some guidance. I have recently graduated college and now that I am out on my own, I have been putting myself out there more and more. I never really had the chance to date while in college so I am having to play catch up which is fine, but my inexperience in and of itself does make things a little difficult. While I have been meeting a lot of really awesome people, I always get kind of stuck when sex becomes a possibility. I never participated in hookup culture while in college because I never really liked the idea of just sleeping with someone without fully trusting them or at least knowing them a fair bit. Will this make things more difficult for me or will it just mean I have to tweak my approach?"
Is it really that bad to try dating while you’re picking yourself back together?,"I was reading a couple of posts and sure enough, it always leads to someone going down someone’s post history to tell them why their life is fucked and they need to improve it before dating. It comes off hella judgmental and in some cases, they don’t even answer what the post is asking

I get the idea of working on yourself to improve your chances of dating and an healthier more independent mindset but I don’t understand why abstinence from dating or even seeking out a partner, friend, activity partner, FWB or whatever is so necessary for that. Humans are social creatures and someone is feeling lonely and wants some kind of social interaction then it’s completely understandable that they’d want to get advice on how to get that.

I just feel like these “just wait until you get better” kind of responses are a bit r/wowthanksimcured and are not too helpful."
I finally found one,"After over a year of online dating on eHarmony, I finally found a guy who wants a second date. And he is easily the most attractive guy I have met up with. He feels out of my league because I am a little overweight. But he says he loves my smile and we seemed to hit it off pretty good...

Just wish me luck on our second date next weekend. We are going to a museum."
Why do girls go hot and cold on you?,"I got ghosted by a girl I asked out but then she invites me out with her friends, so I think we’re cool to be friends at least. But then when I’m there she avoids me. Wtf? My brain does not compute."
Dating is different now,"I just recently had a 10 year relationship end, and am now looking at how dating works in 2019. 

Things are so much different than the last time I met someone. I literally met her in a coffee shop, and now it's Coffee Meets Bagel. There was a spark, and now it's Tinder.

I used to be with ‘it’, but then they changed what ‘it’ was. Now what I’m with isn’t ‘it’ anymore and what’s ‘it’ seems weird and scary. It’ll happen to you!


Update: just got a date the old fashioned way. With a delightful homeless lady in a Walgreens parking lot."
Common Online dating phrases decoded.," I (M39) have been online dating for a year now and I'm picking up on some subtext that could be useful to others. These are the key words and clues to some interesting meanings. 

“Adventure” = Code for any date or activity which is not the traditional movie, dinner, or drinks. 

“Travel” or “golf” with accompanying international destination photos. = Code for I’m well off and have disposable income and am looking for the same in a new partner. 

“Into Fitness” or “workout regularly” with multiple bathing suit / gym photos or IG tag only = Code for I’m somewhat vein and superficial but I’m also fit and expect you to be as well.

“Go out or stay in” or “Ambivert” = Code for I’m not an anxiety-ridden recluse and I’m also not overcompensating for personality flaws with raw energy.

“Day drinking” with more than one photo with an adult beverage = Code for I’m alcoholic and/or enjoy binge drinking. 

Fluent in Sarcasm = Code for I’m mean and snarky but I play it off as humor. 

These are the meaningless ones that I’m sick of.

"Are men really into girls who act ""hard to get"" even if they are interested in him too?","Personally I have never met a man who claimed this was the case in my entire life. I'm a guy and have had honest guy talks with about 30~ friends over the years from varying circumstances and backgrounds and all of them actually seem to think that being ""easy to get"" is actually a more attractive trait so long as it's exclusive to you (i.e., not slutty)"
So Many Men Secretly In Relationships On Dating Sites!,"So the last time I was on dating sites/apps, the last 10 or so men I met online, they all secretly had a girlfriend.  I had absolutely no idea!  They pretended to be single and looking for something serious.  Several of them had a live-in girlfriend as well.

What is the deal with this?  How can I avoid these guy?!

I feel like I have to deeply online stalk any guy I'm potentially meeting with now, before we meet.  Just because I don't want to have to go through this type of thing again.

Anyone have similar experiences dating online?!"
I'm done with online dating! Does anyone else feel like it brings so much negativity into their life??,"I'm 27F, and I've never really been on a relationship due to the way I was raised. I've always been shy, and I never made any efforts on meeting people. Relationships were never really on my mind until lately. 


I've spent years working on myself, I successfully became a mechanical engineer, I'm proud of myself and what I've accomplished. I worked on improving myself the last few years, I'm more outgoing, stopped being afraid of going out of my comfort zone, I enjoy my own company, and I like spending time with people as well and meeting new people. I take care of myself, I dress nicely, I look nice, I have a great body shape. 


And I figured, since I'm in a good place with myself, I could try putting myself more out there, and go on dates. 


My friends suggested dating apps. So I went for it with no expectations at first but to meet new people, go on dates and see where it all goes.


First of all, I can not go on dates with multiple people at the same time! For all of you who can, I don't know how you can give your energy to many people at the same time...


So I only met with 3 guys in total (not at the same time, these stories are at least 1 month apart), the rest I match with they either don't even talk, were just passing by the city and by the time you match they're 500 miles away, or straight up start telling you what they want to do to you (gross)! 


________________________


So with the first guy, we dated for 3 months. We were intimate too. Last time we saw each other, he didn't stop telling me how much he'd love to see me again. Then after that begun the fade away, saying he's too busy. I gave up at some point... then asked him months later why he disappeared without saying anything. He simply said that ""we didn't owe each other anything"".


________________________


Second guy I met, he texted and talked a LOT! We met the first time, it all went well. Then we kept talking and texting each other after that, he seemed so into me. And the way he was talking about his last relationships, he didn't seem like the type who dates around. We had plans to meet a week later. 


The day of the date. He texed me in the morning, and started a normal conversation like always. He told me that he went out for a drink the night before then went back home and ""slept like a baby"". 

We kept talking through the day about random stuff (we were supposed to meet the same evening). Then at some point I asked him if he was still keen to meet up. He then said ""the truth is, I went out for a drink with a girl last night, and she ended up spending the night at my place, so I don't think it would be appropriate to meet tonight"".... B*TCH! And why didn't you say it earlier to cancel the damn date?? (Actually asked this in a calm way). He said that he didn't know how things will evolve with her, and so he didn't say anything.


I felt like I was an option, or like it's whoever agreed on having sex first...then what's the point on going on a date and getting to know the person if all you're looking for is a hole. 

But what really pissed me off, is the fact that he kept avoiding saying anything about it until last minute, and didn't even think about canceling the date before. 


But then ok, I guess I should be at least glad he didn't lie and date us both at the same time.


________________________


The 3rd and last guy, I met him last friday. The date was great! We had so much in common, we liked the same stuff and we were both surprised to find out. He looked like he had a really great time, and while we were walking after dinner, he kissed me in a very smooth way. We made out again later before parting ways. We kept texting each other the next day. It all seemed like it was going well until he sent me out of nowhere ""friday was really fun, but I'd like to leave it at that""...  I know for a fact that he didn't meet anyone in between. It's fine, but I just don't get where it all went wrong!

________________________


I know that what happened to me are things that normally happen. Especially with online dating. But I just can't get how this all works, and it's tiring! 

I hate how getting rejected suddenly started affecting my self esteem and my mood! And I don't know how to deal with that. I feel jaded, and tired, and I have no desire to meet anyone or put anymore efforts on that.

I've had my share of online dating, and I'm done with it.


PS: This is more of a rant, but if you have any advice that I could use, I would appreciate it.

"
How long before you are truly invested?,"There is no textbook answer for this, but one thing I have noticed a trend in this sub is people who are still just starting out in a relationship (6 months in or under) and questioning red flags from their BF/GF. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, and this comes only from my personal experience and observations of others is that if you are still within a year of getting together, you are still learning about who the other person is. Even if you feel that beautiful deep connection in your soul (Which I truly believe in), this other person is still a stranger to you. You are learning who they are, which is part of the beautiful game of dating and of life. 

&#x200B;

You don't owe a stranger your mental and emotional health. If you see a red flag, feel the strength to take a step back and say to yourself, ""I have only been with this person a few months and this is what they are showing me as who they are. Is this who I want to be with?""

&#x200B;

Listen to your gut and don't think you owe anyone anything over your own health and safety."
Bumble in a nutshell.,"I know these compilations have been made before, but I just wanted to make my own. I've used Tinder and OKCupid in the past. I'll soon be deleting Bumble. 

The sample is overwhelmingly White women. I am not White. I am looking for a long-term relationship. I have not had success in any capacity. Often times, the profile will have no bio at all. In those cases, I swipe left mechanically. I live a good distance away from Chicago.

1. Some variation of ""Don't really know what I'm on here for"" or ""My friend made me do this""
2. Some variation of ""The Office is my favorite show!"" or ""I quote too much from The Office""
3. ""Sydney - New York - Chicago""
4. Some variation of ""I love traveling"" or ""Wanderlust""
5. ""420""
6. ""Just here for the free food""
7. ""Looking for a +1 to my cousin's wedding""
8. ""Margaritas and tacos""
9. Some variation of ""Dog mom"" or ""Chances are I'll like your dog better than you""
10. ""Actually, I'm 19. Bumble keeps saying I'm 23""
11. ""UW - Madison""
12. ""Just looking for the Jim to my Pam""
13. Some variation of ""Love being outdoors"" or ""Looking for my next adventure""
14. ""Fluent in sarcasm""
15. ""nOt LoOkInG fOr HoOkUpS""
16. ""Talk \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to me""
17. ""Trying to find someone who looks at me the same way that I look at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_""
18.  ""IG - \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" ""SC - \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_""
19. ""Couple - just looking for a 3rd""
20. Some cryptic quote like ""When the sunsets on love, the moon rises with indifference"" or some bullshit.

The quote that pretty much surmised my feelings toward this whole thing came from a Black woman on the app and it nails the head perfectly on this dating coffin:

""*Everyone seems to love The Office. I mean I get it, but wow, is it possible to find genuine human connection on here?""* 

I’m going to continue the list with a few additions that other redditors suggested. I’ll also give them credit for their suggestions. Thank you to everyone who commented and/or threw more ideas out there. I hope everyone finds someone special for the coming year.

"Girl is awesome, looks nothing like her photos M26 F30's","Met a girl yesterday after talking for over a week. We both have the same sense of humor and everything flows so well. So, I meet her yesterday and I am not attracted at all physically. I tried to be, but I just don't have it. Not only did she look different in her photos, but she wasn't as attractive and she was way heavier, which I am not against someone heavier, but this was too heavy for me. I feel like an asshole because we connected so well, but I had to force everything in person because I just was not into it. I think she really likes me and I feel bad.

&#x200B;

TL;DR-Girl and me talked for over a week. Met and she doesn't look like her photos.

&#x200B;

Update: It isn't just about weight in the photos. She looks completely different in person. I don't know if it is the snapchat filters or the editing, but it is kind of mind blowing. Like, I don't mind heavier at all. I will be with a girl even if shes heavier, but it is just weird to me of how different she looks from what I expected. She even said after dinner,""Do I look anything like my photos?"" I told her yes when I should have been honest. I was just trying to get out of there without making a scene."
"When it’s right, it’s right.","  

I have posted a couple times on here and just wanted to share a very positive experience.

Him \[26M\] and I \[24F\] met on an online dating app. Our third date was great but ended on a really awkward kiss (my first one). We had another date planned for yesterday. The day already started off great when he asked to meet up an hour earlier than planned because he “couldn’t wait.” He picked me up at my house. We went to his favorite restaurant for dinner because we were celebrating some big news for him. Over dinner we had a couple pauses where we would kind of just look at each other and smile a lot. I was like “what?” He told me he wasn’t seeing anyone else and I told him I wasn’t either. It was super cute. Turns out that I was the last person he was going to try dating with on the app before deleting it and he just happened to be the first person I matched with. Luck has been on our sides. We hold hands walking back to the car and drive back to my house. I live with my parents but invited him inside because I had made dessert for him (again, to celebrate his big news). We go downstairs. I could hear my parents upstairs and didn’t know if it was too soon to introduce him to them but I thought “what the hell, let’s do it.” They meet each other and it goes super well. We go back downstairs and sit on my couch eating the dessert.  Again, we just have those moments where we look at each other and smile a lot. Then, he hesitantly asks me if the kiss on our last date was my first one. Which is super embarrassing for me so I ask him, “what if it was?” He says he would feel really bad, that he didn’t want to rush things but he really wanted to kiss me last time so he did. I tell him not to worry about it, just that I don’t know what I am doing so he’s going to have to take the lead. In retrospect this whole conversation was perfect to me. He was so nice and understanding, I can’t explain it. So this time when he goes in for a kiss we are completely on the same page, it was so much better. I still don’t know what I am doing but I feel whole lot better about it because of him. We just sat there talking with each other and holding hands for a while until he had to go because he had to go to work the next day. It was the most perfect night. 

I just wanted to spread some positivity for those of you that might feel “behind” in terms of dating like I did. There are people out there that will be so good to you and make you feel so special because they like you so much and they will go at your pace just to make you feel comfortable – the hard part is finding them! I am definitely lucky in that regard. "
Great first date!,"I (32/F) went out on a wholesome coffee date with a guy (33/M) from a dating app today and was pleasantly surprised that he checks off most of my boxes. 

After we had coffee, we went on a nature walk at one of my favorite parks, I caught the butterflies as we held hands as we watched birds and chatted. It was like a fairy tale. I don't want to brag too much to friends so I decided to post about it here."
after a shitload of rejections I like going to my local park latealone at night and just sit on a swing in complete darkness.....,"and just wonder what the meaning of life is. It's quite relaxing. 😊

Edit: damn didn't expect this much attention wow!"
dating sites,dating sites do not work for me at all. lots of guys just want to hook up and im so over that. i want a boyfriend and someone who’s consistent and loyal. how the hell can i find that?
I’m a 20 m and have never dated due to a bad home life. I’ve been out on my own since the start of the year and still don’t know where to start.,"EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for all the support and advice! Please don’t stop if you want to add anything else lol. I just wanted to show my appreciation if I don’t thank each of you individually.


TL;DR is basically the title. I have some baggage because of the bad situation I came out of. What follows is a fair bit of context for anyone who wants it.


Long story short, I dealt with a lot of isolation, manipulation, and domestic abuse (nothing physical) for most of my life. I escaped it all with my brother back in January and am happily on my own away from my messed up family.

I’m socially awkward due to this past, but I’m steadily improving myself in the world. I’m not in that great of a position financially, but then again, I’m starting from scratch so I won’t be 100% for a few years at least. I got a GED, a license, a part time job, a place to stay until I can afford my own rent, and have even branched out to form some platonic relationships. I would only dream of obtaining those things back at my old home. But as much as I’m improving in my life, I haven’t made much progress in as far as romance goes.

I don’t really have a car, so I’m limited to the place I’m in. It’s not ideal, but it’s completely doable because it’s a small, but decently populated city. 

My main social activities are me being at work and going to church on Sundays. I haven’t fully committed myself to online dating because I don’t know how to go about it."
Guy I'm dating always asks for selfies,"I'm (24, F) dating a guy(29, M) I met on Bumble. We have fun together, we've only been on two dates so far but we have more planned. He's said he likes me and wants to keep dating and we stay in contact. I like him but one thing he does regularly is ask for a selfie. The first time he asked I was going to class so I scurried and sent him one. The second time he asked today I had no makeup on, was not trying in terms of looks. I sent him one and both time he'll reply with heart eyes or a kissy face. I don't know why but I hate that kind of attention. I don't think I have a gorgeous face or anything, it's just a face and if i were asked I'd almost objectively say I lean more towards unattractive. I'm just a human living life and doing her thing. The idea of sending someone selfies is so bizarre to me. I have never asked anyone to ""send me a selfie"". Is this normal behavior? For anyone who does this with their S.O or person they're dating  can you explain this to me?"
How come dating is so easy for some people?,"22m virgin here, never been on a date. I'm actually perplexed at how easy some people have it when it comes to dating. Most people have met someone who is interested in having sex with them by the age of 17. How the fuck? I have tried every free dating site, never got a match or reply. Been clubbing numerous times, women just walk off or turn around when you approach. Joined hobby clubs at university, no women were interested.

How do some people manage to date multiple people by the age of 25? It just seems so bizarre to me when getting a women's number is a mission. I take care of myself, work out, make sure my clothes and hygiene are on point yet still have never met a woman who wanted to date me.

I guess my question is, how do some of you find getting dates so easy? What are you doing that some of us aren't? Thank you."
GHOSTING IS COWARDLY AND EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE. Try to change my mind.,"No, seriously. I'm near renaming my Millenial Generation ""The Cowards."" Have an adult conversation, jeeeeeeesus.

I got turned down tonight,"I had a really chill day today. Stopped at work for a few hours of easy OT just to check on some deadlines. Was productive. Went home and smoked/napped.

Went to the mall down the street to browse shoe deals. Ended up buying some shirts from cotton on. The manager was super cute and we even had a laugh at check out. 

Left the store, went downstairs and sat on the coin massage chairs trying to build up the courage to ask her out.

Walked back up to the store and asked her if she could help me out with something (kind of hinted toward another part of the store because there were customers/coworkers). Anyways she didn’t budge positions and asked me what I needed. I smiled and simply asked her if she was free tonight. She smiled, laughed and said “tonight?? Uhh, I’m not I’m sorry” while blushing. 

I just smiled back, said ok and left. She was super cute. I haven’t asked a girl out like that in YEARS but I feel it was the right way to do it. Made it easy for her to say no and just walk away. Felt real nice. Still does. 

Everyone’s happy."
We’re exclusive now!,"I’ve (25F) been seeing this guy (37M) since August/September. We never discussed what we were looking for and what our intentions were so boundaries were not created. He was dating other people which lead me to date other people and it was just very stressful because I did want more.
Over the past month a lot things have happened that made me feel confident he felt the same way too. I originally planned this whole speech to give about the situation and call him out for seeing other people blah blah blah. But knowing me I need as few words as possible to get my point across (because my nerves get the best of me and I end up forgetting what I wanted to say). 
So instead I planned on asking him “what do you think about us being exclusive?” because to me that hits all the points I wanted to bring up. It acknowledges the fact we’ve been seeing other people and it indirectly says I have feelings for him and eventually would like a relationship. I went with that.
It was this past Monday morning and we were on the subway. He was going to work and I was heading to the train station to go home. Doing it in a public place isn’t great but it made me more comfortable for some reason. We’re sitting there and I know I have to do it now. “Can I get your opinion on something?” I ask. He says of course. Then I ask him. And oh my god the look on his face. I have never seen him look so nervous/scared. The only thing he says is “well this came out of nowhere”. I told him I apologize for that but there’s no textbook way to really bring this up. We sit in silence for a few more seconds. I can tell the gears are turning in his head. I tell him to be honest with me, and that if he needs to think about it that’s fine. But then he says “okay, yea let’s do it”. It felt like fireworks were going off in my heart but I remained calm on the outside and just smiled. I think I asked him “are you sure?” about five times haha. He said yes and then kissed me. I could tell he was pretty happy.

I still can’t believe it worked out. I’m feeling so relieved and honestly 100 lbs lighter now that all the stress/anxiety is gone. I’m trusting him and the fact that he knows what this is. Can’t wait to see what the future holds (:"
The “Slow Fade”,"This a vent- just want to put my feelings into words. Me and this women met on bumble back around Christmas time. Hit it off right off the bat and talked on the phone for 6 hours the day we met. At the time I thought this was to good to be true. We met 3 days later and the first date was amazing, never had a women look at me the way she did. Kept on telling me that she was so happy we met and the potential she saw in me, I felt the same. Not that I was in love, but if I ever had a “love at first site” moment in my life it was her. For the past 2 months we were seeing each other twice a week at it was great, it just felt right. Asked her if she wanted to date exclusively 5 days ago and since then I’ve been getting the slow fade. This shit sucks, I can’t stop thinking about the time we first met and the excitement and it makes me so sad. I’ll get over it, it will be old news soon but this one really hurt me bad. Thanks for whoever read. Just had to get it off my chest."
Seems impossible to meet someone after college,"I just can not understand how you meet someone after coming from university. Work is not an option because I can go an entire day and not see a woman my age. Then I go to a busy gym where it would seem really weird to even talk to someone. Lastly I head home to my apartment where I never see anyone.

Pretty much every friend I have is dating someone now too. So if I go out I feel like an extra wheel.

All my previous relationships have just been through partying in college so I am lost. I wouldn’t say I’m really introverted but I am very... laid back. Do people really just go up and talk to strangers at places like grocery stores or whatever? Just seems so odd to me.

Any advice or even telling the story of how you met your so would help.
"
"Instead of ghosting, you do the opposite. You show up, unannounced, at her house. That’ll freak her out and she won’t want to date you.","Mailman her! In a playful way, not a stalkerish kind of way. Or, if you haven’t met, just go 100% needy geek on her. Saw this on a TV show and couldn’t stop laughing. "
I have decided to take a break from dating for an entire year,"This year has been pretty awful for me ( F, 24) in terms of dating, and I guess I'm posting this to hold myself accountable. 

I need a break. Dating this year has been better than the last, but it's been emotionally draining, and filled with disappointments. I know what I deserve, but I really do believe that taking a year off will really help center myself and boost my confidence again. I want a relationship-sure. I think in dating this past year however, I have forgotten to focus on myself and who I am. I need to do this for me and my sanity. Here are the things I want to accomplish in 2019. 

&#x200B;

1. Love my body again
2. Spend lots of time with friends and loved ones
3. Get outside more 

I'm sure I'll think of more as the day goes on, but if anyone has done this and can offer some advice, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Edit: Wow I definitely wasn’t expecting so much support! Thanks everyone, it means a lot. Feel free to message me if you wanna join me haha"
From a Blind Girl To You Lovely Guys Who Can See,"Aloha ;) I'm a completely blind 19-year-old girl and I usually date blind or partially sighted guys but I'm a New Yorker and that's way too limiting. So far, I've been on seven first dates with sighted guys and most of them were in the last six weeks. So while everything is still fresh, I'm here to vent, apologize  and gush.
1. I'm not going to feel your face. I have a lot of ways to sneakily tell what you look like and I've only done that to boyfriends and really close friends because it seems pretty damn intimate.

2. Telling me about that beautiful or visually interesting thing you saw isn't insensitive. I actually find it sweet when someone is willing to go out of their way to share what makes them think or makes them happy.

3. It's really fucking adorable when I'm temporarily doing something that requires both hands and a guy offers to hold my cane or fold it for me. Yes, I can just hold it with an arm or shove it in my bag like I always do, and I'm too independent to ask, but this made me swoon.

4. If I like your voice and you're sweet/smart and can make me laugh )bonus points for original blind jokes and sarcasm(, I probably like you. So don't freak out if I ask for a picture or your Instagram so me and the girls can gossip, we all have different types and they don't decide who I date, unless you're an asshole to them or something.

5. If you're purposely walking through alleyways and joking about being a serial killer, don't be surprised when I don't trust you to guide me for the rest of the date.

6. First dates make me nervous, especially if I know it's someone's first meaningful interaction with a blind person. So if I seem like I've never swiped a metro card before or accidentally slap my silverware off the table, I promise I'm not usually like that and I'll be half as clumsy by the second date.

7. Don't read my phone screen, it's fucking RUDE and that's the reason I usually keep my screen curtain on.

8. I don't want to hear about how you like blindfolding girls during sex and you're happy you won't have to do that with me on a first date in the middle of a crowded restaurant.

9. I'm professing my love to the guy who already knows sign language to make life easier for deaf people and wants to learn Braille because different writing systems interest him. Of course, this isn't a requirement but reading and writing are big parts of my life and it's awesome if you're interested in something so important.

Andnd finally, if I'm flirting and getting slightly touchy during our date, I'd probably love a hug at the end. I know I've given a few half-assed ones but that's usually because I'm trying to get on the train or I feel bad about the cabdriver sitting there awkwardly."
Today's Date Experience,"Hey all, today I (27M) had a first date with a girl I met on Bumble. We went on a hike, a popular one with plenty of other hikers around- I didn't take her anywhere really isolated or anything. It seems to me that it went well, and she seems like a cool person. We got a picture together taken by another hiker on the trail. I got her number and, while we didn't kiss, we hugged at the end. We don't have a second date set up yet, but I hope to do it soon! Just wanted to share the experience. 

UPDATE (2/8/19): For anyone who is interested, I am currently planning to have lunch with her this Sunday! "
My method of testing the water,"Sorry if this is not the right sub, first time here.

We've all been there: You're meeting a girl/guy, start talking, sitting next to each other, and things seem to go ok. They seem to be interested in you, and you want to make a move, but you're not sure if they are actually interested, or just being friendly/polite. Breaking the touch barrier might be a bit tricky: Touching their shoulder often doesn't have the effect you are looking for, as most of the time it does not provoke too much of a response, whether they like the touch or not. On the other hand, things like putting your hand on their thigh are too aggressive and could be very uncomfortable for the other person.

What I found to be working the best in between these options is gently touching their hand with yours. make a quick contact, maybe run your thump along their finger for a couple of seconds. If they are uncomfortable with that, they will automatically move their hand right away, and that would be the end of it. But if they are into you, they will take your hand, or reciprocate by being playful with their own fingers.

The advantage that I have found with that specific touch is that it is direct enough for the other person to realise you're not just touching them by accident/friendliness, but subtle and gentle enough to not be seen as intrusive or threatening, while giving the other person an easy way out if they are not interested."
"I'm officially done with dating, and here's why","I don't intend for this to be a self-pity post after a string of shitty dating experiences, but I personally wanted to share mine and why I'm done with dating. I also don't mean for this to be a hate post toward men. I know there are good men out there, but they're hard for me to find.

I've only had one boyfriend. He was misogynistic. He repeatedly violated my physical boundaries. He liked to play the victim and shift the blame on me whenever I was hurt by him. Then I found out he cheated on me. I dumped him, of course, but my shitty relationship experience with him wasn't going to deter me from jumping back into the dating game and finding someone decent out there. I now realize that was too much for me to ask. A big lesson I learned is to not ignore red flags ever again.

The first guy I went on two dates with. He seemed normal the first time, and I really enjoyed our time spent together. He seemed so...sweet, normal. He didn't overstep any boundaries. The second date is when I started noticing something was off. He was kissing me way too much. That's not really the weird part. When I pulled away and told him that was enough, he would just lean in to kiss me again. He wanted to know my kinks and asked if I liked being choked while placing his hand over my neck and squeezing gently. He started kissing me again and asking me to tell him what I'm into, and I pulled away and said I'm not telling him, and he responded, ''No, you're telling me now.'' and he proceeded to kiss me. I honestly felt uncomfortable and I just wanted him to stop. He was also insistent on driving me to work afterwards even though I kept telling him I wanted to walk. I did speak to him about it later on over text and he was apologetic for making me feel uncomfortable.

There was another guy I was talking to for a while, we didn't meet right away but he became really needy and pushy. Then I went on a couple dates with ANOTHER guy. First two dates went pretty well, he seemed like a good guy. Very laid-back and introspective. We went on our third date last night and we were discussing our biggest fears. I told him I feared being physically harmed in some way, and he replied, ''Like how, being raped?'' and I replied yes, and he made a quip that I would probably enjoy it.

So, uh, yeah. This just about sums up my experience with dating men and I'm officially quitting. I know there are good guys out there, but I don't to have to sift through all the shitty ones just to find that one decent one. I'm focusing on myself henceforth."
My (F25) experience with online dating as a hetero woman.,"I'll get right to it. I've been using online dating on and off since I was 18. It's mostly been a lot of frustration. As a woman I understand that it's a lot of pressure to put on men to always expect them to make the first move, so I have always tried to get out there and make it known when I am into a guy. However, in doing so I have noticed a lot of common issues that are very likely getting in the way of people finding one another, so I thought I would make this post to hopefully help both men and women when it comes to online dating. Since I am heterosexual, I've really only seen straight men's profiles, so I'll be focusing on the issues that I see from that particular group as well as the quality of communication that I have received over the years:





1) **Profile Pictures** - Many of them are not even of the person themselves. A large majority have only one, poorly lit photo. Even more have only one picture in which they are wearing sunglasses that cover most of their facial features. Group photos that don't specify who is the profile owner. None of these options represents the person well. In my experience, I am far more likely to swipe left on a profile like this. It makes it very difficult to discern what someone looks like and determine whether you could be attracted to them or not. Whether you are confident in your looks or more on the shy side, either way, an accurate depiction of yourself will land you far more options than any of these I mentioned.





2) **Self Description** - I see far too many men's profiles that have ""ask me"" or just ""ask"" in every section. I understand the thought behind this, or what I assume to be the idea. If someone is interested enough, they will just ask, or maybe it's hard to know what to write. I get it. But remember, online dating is about marketing yourself to others. It's your job to do your best to represent yourself well and accurately to attract the kind of person you are looking for. I can say confidently that I immediately swipe left on this kind of profile no matter what the picture looks like. If you can't be bothered to fill in a little info about yourself, I'm not going to pull it out of you. That information is incredibly crucial. When someone does decide to message you, that information has already opened up a bunch of talking points and opportunity to get to know each other better. It's a super important factor to facilitate conversation. It's the combination of both pictures and personality that draws me to a guy. I personally appreciate an 'about me' section that reads like it was written honestly. It doesn't have to be perfect. It just needs to give people an idea of who you are, what you love, and what you want out of life. A profile in which someone has put in some honest effort to convey that information is so much more attractive than ""ask me.""





3) **Omitting certain information** - Ok guys. Let's get real. Things like height, body type, having/not having kids, having a car, certain values, occupation etc. are all very important things when determining a partner. Whether you are totally satisfied with your current answers to these questions or not, I strongly recommend that you do answer them, and answer them honestly. Here's an example. I am a plus-sized woman. If I were to put on my profile that I am anything other than that, I would be matched up with men that don't prefer women of my size. I would then be disappointed that none of my matches are interested in me, and would have wasted a lot of my own time as well as others'. Instead, I answer it honestly and say that I am, in fact, a large woman. So I am matched up with men that are open to dating someone like me, and I have far better luck with dating. Makes sense, right? No matter what you have, where you are in life, what you look like, there is someone out there for everyone. But it's going to be a lot more difficult if you are casting your net in the wrong direction. Tell us the truth about things, guys. It's well worth it.





4) **Communication** - Ok this is a huge one, and one that I don't really understand to boot. It is far too common that when I message a guy first, and I almost always do, the conversation dies off very, very quickly. I take the time to read the profile of the person I am messaging so that I can more easily add to the conversation and make it easy for them to do the same. This is where it's important to have that information available. Most times, I will receive a single word answer to an open-ended question, and no follow up. They respond when I send a message, but with very few words and no attempt to keep the conversation going, never ask questions, etc. Now one might think that they are just not very interested, except for the fact that they often ask why I stopped messaging them, seemingly unaware. It's because I am not into one-sided conversations where I have to do all of the work. It's a give and take. So guys, if this happens to you, compare your messages to the ones you are receiving. Are you asking her about herself too? Did you reference anything that was in her profile? I will admit it is different talking to someone in person than it is messaging over a website, I think it's a little more challenging and that's why conversational skills are that much more important for online dating. Learning about each other is going to be a little tedious and awkward at first, or at least it is IME until you get the usual niceties out of the way. Don't be afraid try and say a little more, it just gives us more to talk about.





5) **Read my profile** - There are a lot of reasons for this, but the biggest issue I have experienced personally is due to my status of being Child Free. I've lost count of the number of times a guy with children has contacted me, and then been surprised or angry when I say it's not going to work out. Had they paid attention to the obvious disclaimer on my profile, we could have both avoided wasting our time. This goes right along with #3. Do not omit the fact that you have kids and expect a CF person to suddenly be ok with it. You are setting yourself up to fail, and not to mention, it's a dick move.




So these are the five biggest issues I've witnessed quite a bit. If you've read up until this point I'd like to say thanks. I hope this helps everyone in their dating endeavors and hopefully lessens some of the more frustrating aspects of it. 



If there is something I left out or if you have something to add, please leave a comment. Thoughts and constructive criticism are welcome.



Edit: I'd like to add that this definitely applies to everyone, gender aside.

I would also love to add a couple of things in reference to taking good pictures. I personally use the lighting in my bathroom to take my best pictures. Make-up lights will do absolute wonders. Some residential bathrooms have them, it's the kind with several large, round bulbs usually at the top of the mirror or around the perimeter. I do my hair and put on my best outfit, then just play around with the front-facing camera on my phone. Truth be told, I will get one really good picture out of every 25 or more. It's a real pain trying to get it right but it's worth it in my opinion."
When your gut tells you to feel like something is rubbing you the wrong way don't ignore it. Stand up for yourself.,"You're  gonna be a friend or dating and something will happen that someone does is going to make you feel some type of way.

Here's  a hint: don't ignore it. You're  feeling someway because theres a reason. You'll  run into alot of people that will tell you one thing  and do another. The older you get the less you pay attention  to the shit people say and the more you pay attention to what people do.

If some one calls you a friend they'll  value you and make themselves able to see you. Instead they wont go in the opposite.

There are tons of wolves in sheeps clothing out here. They'll  drain you, use you and then make you the villian in their sick game.

When you feel in your gut something isn't right you speak up for yourself and yes it may burn a bridge, but may the bridges  i burn light the way home.

There should be a reverse tinder,"Practically everyone knows that Tinder is real shit for your self-image, right? Since people are judging you on your looks rather than you? 
All I'm saying is that there should be a tinder-like app where it shows like 5 bullet points about the person, and you swipe left or right based on that. If you swipe right, then you get to see pictures of the person and talk to them.
(Yes, I am a hater of Tinder due to lack of success and my disgusting schlubby body)

Is that already a thing? "
Just Deleted my Dating Apps and I feel Great,"I think at this point, it was time to throw in the towel. I've been on these apps since my breakup with my ex and a year and a half ago, and really had no success.

When I first started using the apps, I was naive. Everytime I got a match, I got a feeling of excitement. At this point, even if I get matched with a super attractive girl, I feel nothing because now I know better. 100% of my matches devolved into nothing, in one way or another. 

- Either they don't message you at all.
- They don't respond to your messages when you message first.
- They take days to respond (which is fine if they're busy, but more often than not it implies they don't care to speak to you and I just take the hint).
- They produce thoughtless responses that don't promote conversation.
- They don't want to go on a date.
- They accept the date and then flake.
- You go on the date and they suddenly ghost you afterwards.
- They are not ready for a relationship.

Yeah, sure, I've had great conversations with some girls -no doubt. But still, at some point in time the interaction ended with any of the points above.

Eventually this was starting to affect me in my daily life outside of these apps. Not because it didn't work out with girls specifically, but because it just killed any motivation about me to be excited about anything in my daily life. I felt like if something good happened to me, it would only be a matter of time before something disappointing would follow. As if to say I didn't deserve good things to happen to me, because that's what I was used to in my experience in these apps for the past year and a half.

I stuck with these apps just hoping for that ""one girl"" to surpass all these rest, but it never came to be. One could probably just say ""man up, rejection is part of the game "", but hey, it's not like I've been on these apps for just a week or two. A year and a half and nothing. Enough is enough. When I realized it got to the point where it's affecting my ability to get excited about good things in my life, the solution became obvious. So I deleted the apps.

Now obviously I'll have the thoughts like ""well, if I'm not on the apps now the 'one girl' can't reach out to me"", but it's this exact mindset that keeps me in this vicious loop of disappointment. Clinging on to an idea that really has proved to have no basis in my experience. If I'm going to find someone, it's going to be in person.

And now I feel great. I'm no longer wasting time spamming swipes, looking through superficial profiles. It feels great to not feed into the validation that some people use these apps for. 

This is not an attack about girls on the apps. Ladies, I know full well there are tons and tons of disappointing guys on these apps as well, I just can't speak to that from a personal experience. 

If any of you feel like this situation describes you, I definitely recommend just letting go. Seriously. Delete them and spend the time you would have spent swiping and analyzing profiles and do something that makes you happy instead.

Thanks for reading."
Just delete Tinder,"I will admit since joining Tinder I have;

Lost 60 pounds  

Re-Enrolled in school (I'm now a Dean's list student)  

Quit smoking  

Got a therapist  

Cut my hair  

Finished my first album  

Moved into my own place (no roommates)  

At first, it was the idea of making myself have a broader appeal to women that encouraged me to make these changes. Suddenly, I started getting matches...

Sometimes a ton!  

But it never mattered. I've been on 4 tinder dates in the past 3 years.  

However, I love my life now... and I've realized a couple things;  

Not everyone has to like you, so don't make people pleasing a priority  

And,  

Sometimes you outgrow the things you thought you wanted.  

Yeah, that girl with the Venmo account on her profile may match with me now.  

But she still just wants my money.  

And to be frank, I don't deserve to feel unwanted. Most people are on that app to kill time, fool around, and scam fools.  

So delete the app if it makes you feel shitty."
First date with someone new in 3 years...,"Just wanted to share a wholesome date I had last night. We (21M & 19F)  matched on Tinder AND Bumble a week ago and I got her FB and Snapchat the next day, then set up a date for yesterday, Thursday. We literally sat talking in a pub for like 4 and a half hours non stop. We were meant to go see Captain Marvel but we both completely forgot until it was too late and just decided to keep chatting. And surprisingly she bought the first round, despite me saying I'd pay for it all. We really only had like 2 drinks each, spent the whole time talking. We both live nearby so we walked the whole way back until we had to part ways. I tried to kiss her but she said ""Nope, I don't kiss on the first date, even though I really want to"", so she knows her self worth and knows how much I actually want her. After refusing to give up on a dead relationship due to being afraid to get back into dating, a month afterwards I already had a great date that I'm happy with. Guess I just wanted to share my experience with anyone who is in the same boat as me and afraid to leave a relationship/get back into dating cause they're afraid of not finding someone. If it happened for me, it'll happen for you guys too."
Was I wrong???,"I've been on Bumble for over a month now and I finally got a conversation going, it's only been for a few days. Today, he asked me out on a date. I said sure and then he goes on to tell me that he went out yesterday and wanted to stay in and hang out. He wanted me to go to his house and I told him I don't feel comfortable doing that. He then suggested that we go to my house. I told him that the house situation was out and that we could possibly go out for dinner. I haven't heard anything since....

 I don't feel that it's right to have a first date at someone house and especially if you are looking for something more than a hookup. This isn't the first time I've dealt with this kind of situation. Personally, if this is how people date these days then I rather be alone. That's my home and I feel I should get to know the guy before I invite him into my home. Was I wrong for making the decision I made????

 "
Why do we ignore the red flags?,"Just gotten out of a relationship and now I'm starting to see all the red flags I ignored

I feel stupid for ignoring and not being stronger about my boundaries"
"You might be the one pushing them away too, even if you are interested","Allow me to explain i’ve found out through therapy that you can push someone away with other kinds of behavior that’s not outright rejecting, ghosting or fading (even if you like them!). What happens is if i’m interested in someone by default i expect them to not like me back and subconsciously i try to push them away, i’ve observed my behavior and this is what i gathered.

-Overtexting and then pulling back in an attempt to seem chill, this just confuses the other person and makes them lose interest (Hot and cold behavior).

-Not being able to manage my body language, mine is very closed off and guarded, this has been very challenging to work on.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to answer questions or to  engage in a conversation in a personal way that allows the other person to know you better, so i come across again as either not interested or confusing (you can ask a lot of questions, yet not speak about myself and making it seem as if i’m closed off). This could be solved i think, by allowing yourself to let yourself be you, not what you think you should be and if your personalities don’t mesh at least you were honest.

-Subconsciously “forgetting” to be physically receptive to flirting, like expecting them to do so but it reads as not wanting to be touched if that makes sense. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with having sex, but shutting off the sexual part of attraction (personally i don’t have sex unless i’m in a relationship), but what i mean is that i don’t initiate flirting making me seem like i’m not interested in physical touching.

-I never state that i’m interested and look for signs the other person doesn’t find me attractive or interesting, then i start backing off with no explanation, making them back off as well and thus making a cycle.

-I’m afraid that the moment that i start liking them and let my guard down i will hurt them/scare them with my affection, this is a big and tough one for me because i tend to get attached quickly (i hardly find anyone that i really like and tend to feel really strong about them) and i couldn’t advice someone on this because i don’t know exactly the reason behind it.

-Thinking i’m not interesting enough and that i should have a million hobbies to be even considered dateable, so it becomes an obsession with being perfect for the people i like and never let my true personality show.

-Trying to burn them out subconsciously by being clingy, then when they back off i feel really insecure and i don’t reach out to them, thus coming off as selfish or without a backbone.

Essentially i’m emotionally unavailable subconsciously, but it overlaps with my desire to be in a relationship, if you’re like me and feel like people pull away from you, really consider whether you’re pushing them away in ways you don’t know. For me it’s a deeply ingrained self esteem issue."
Went on 4 dates in 2 weeks!!!,"Hey guys, I am a 22M with one paralyzed arm. I just went on 4 dates in 2 weeks and wanted to share my experience.

I  have recently moved to Canada and don't know anyone here really and  decided to give tinder a try to see how it goes(in the country i came  from it was really dry to say the least). Anyway, to my surprise girls  were more responsive and were willing t go out(I am not exotic or  anything like that). Went on a date with one girl, it was okay, really  formal, got ghosted after that. Went out with the second girl the next  day and we had a really good connection, touching each other and stuff  like that. Unfortunately she lives in a nearby town and only comes to my  town for work, and got a horrible disease recently that put her in a  hospital. We still chat but she doesn't have time to date, but i will of  course go out with her if she wants. Went out with one more girl, again  something was off but it wasn't bad, but we stopped talking. The final  girl i met at a bar, while the others were all at a cafe, and this girl  was really quiet. It was like i had to pull words out of her, maybe she  was nervous , but she messaged me later saying that i am a great guy but  she had no time due to work lol.

What  these 4 dates did for me is that they gave me a huge confidence boost  and that it's okay if it doesn't work out. But I still need to work on  my first impressions. Also, how can i bring up my one arm cause you can  only see that its paralyzed in pictures if you take a look at it. I told  every girl beforehand though, just don't know how to properly bring it  up, or if i need to at all."
Do women approach men?,"21 year old virgin guy here, zero experience with women. I've heard that men and women are the same, that theres very little difference except for sexual anatomy. So my question is, do women approach men like we approach them? Because I've never had a women intiate a conversation with me in my life, so I must be really unattractive. I always thought women just never approached but if we are truly the same then they must, it just never happens to me."
I think I'm dead on the inside.,"The current dating culture has made me super jaded.

1.) I'm not excited to go on dates anymore. It's the same thing over and over again. Getting to know someone...where they went to school, etc. I have to care, but deep down, I really don't. This person I'm getting to know can drop me in an instant...maybe even after this date and this effort will be wasted...again.

2.) Most of the girls I meet have some kind of trauma from their ex or something. Then I have debate if I want to continue or not.

3.) Related to 2, I don't feel all that bad about dropping a girl anymore. I send a politically correct message and try to be friends after. They mostly never want to talk to me again. Where is my friend zone? I don't mind making friends.

4.) I don't wait for/am not excited for a girl's response to my text anymore. If it never comes, I just assume she ghosted me. If she had in fact been hit by a car or something, I sure would never followup...so I'd never know. I don't even feel bad when a girl ghosts me anymore. It's business as usual. 

5.) If I ask a girl out and I'm rejected...I feel nothing. I don't even try to plead my case. She said no? Ok. Move along.

6.) I'm old. I used to worry about not being able to have kids, being alone for the rest of my life, etc. I just don't care about that anymore. I'd rather be lonely than be stuck in a bad relationship.

7.) I'm lonely as hell sometimes, but I'm super calm about it. I don't feel the need to go to bars, etc. to try to meet girls all the time. I'm fine with a Friday night just sitting there by myself watching Netflix or Youtube. If I have an itch one day, I'll go mess around and have fun, but if not? Lazy day it is.

&#x200B;

So...am I dead on the inside? Sure seems like it. LOL."
This sub has been toxic lately,"I recently deleted my old profile on here because I just couldn’t deal with all the toxic people on this sub anymore. I cannot believe how many [r/niceguys](https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys), [r/incels](https://www.reddit.com/r/incels), etc. have infected this place. So many disgusting comments getting upvoted and decent, reasonable people being harassed and attacked for saying things like “no, women don’t owe you, or any guy, anything.”

I feel like the user base here is highly skewed towards “thirsty dudes looking for the magic secret to getting laid/getting a girlfriend,” and that unfortunately leads to a tendency for this crowd to default to always take a rejected guy’s side in any situation, regardless of context. Since they really want (and think they deserve… cringe) more chances in their own lives, “give the guy a chance” is always their default answer. I’ve seen tons of posts where a woman describes all kinds of creepy, cringe-y, stalker-y, even rape-y behavior… and oftentimes the mob *stil*l takes the guy’s side and attacks the woman for “being mean to the poor guy and not giving him a chance.” I see this kind of mentality other places around reddit too. Any time the obvious answer to how to deal with a shitty person engaging in all kinds of awful and inappropriate behavior is “don’t put up with it and kick them out,” a bunch of people will complain about how that’s “unfair,” and that it’s “immature” of them to not put up with other peoples’ bad behavior. Or they act like if someone is acting inappropriately and making everyone around them uncomfortable, that it’s somehow everyone else’s responsibility to teach another adult basic social skills (or be a “dating coach”). In light of this, I have to think that a lot of these people rabidly defending “the creepy guy” or “the friend no one likes” in these stories probably *are* “that guy” in their own social lives.

And the anti-ghosting crusade. Holy shit. All these emotionally unstable people act like the fucking sky is falling, the world is ending, and the art of civility and human connection is irreparably broken… because people occasionally don’t contact some random person they barely knew after going on a date with them. News flash, it’s not everyone else’s problem that *you* can’t take a hint and/or have attachment issues. People will often tell (or respond to) these stories where it was *very*obvious the other person wasn’t into them, and then act all confused because “they didn’t say those words exactly.” Then they will inevitably blame the other person (usually, the woman) for “not communicating.” Communication is a two-way street, and if you miss or ignore every single non-verbal way that someone is communicating that they don’t like you and are uncomfortable with you, that’s a failure to communicate and act in a socially appropriate way. As an adult, you shouldn’t *need* other people to tell you those things. “I didn’t know any better” is no excuse for acting like a creep.

And these same people who absolutely lose their shit over getting ghosted and rabidly attack anyone who *dares* tell them that “no, it’s really not that big of deal and you should get over it,” have the nerve to gush about what great gentleman they are and how they would totally handle rejection well… They can’t even take a stranger on the internet saying something they disagree with well.

I see a similar issue with guys posting creepy stories basically outlining how obsessed/fixated they are on some girl, sometimes to the point of stalking, and then viciously attacking anyone who points out that “you know, it’s pretty unhealthy to be that obsessed with someone you aren’t even dating or anything.” They’ll say all kinds of nasty things to anyone who dares criticize them… and then do the same “gush about how I’m such a gentleman and *definitely* not a stalker” routine.

One of the best pieces of advice my boss has given me is “you have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself as an observer. You have to see yourself the way others see you.” And these cringe-y guys just don’t understand that. Throwing a tantrum because you got rejected, not called back, or dumped looks bad. Ranting about “how terrible all women are” because of one or two bad experiences in your personal life looks bad. Expecting some kind of gold star or “credit you can redeem for a wonderful girlfriend” for being a law-abiding citizen who is generally polite, has a job, a car, and your own place is laughable. I mean, seriously, do these people even *hear* themselves?"
Feels like I'll [F25] never find what I'm looking for.,"So I feel like I'm in a pickle because I'm basically a walking contradiction.

I have no desire or temperament for casual relationships/FWBs/ONS and I take dating seriously as a monogamous person - but I desire and require tons of freedom and space in a romantic partnership. My ideal set up is that of two committed, interdependent people: folks who have their separate hobbies, friends, and interests but enjoy life together and are loyal to each other. I'm an introvert and for the most part, I enjoy being single and have a pretty busy life. I don't like texting constantly and the most I can handle seeing my S/O in a week is three times top.

I've only had one real relationship and that was with someone who definitely *not* compatible with me in that sense. I've rejected all past (and subsequent) romantic opportunities at the first sign of clinginess from the other person. Frustratingly enough, I feel like all I encounter in the dating scene are guys who either want to hit-n-run or settle down ASAP and practically live inside each other's skins. The most ironic thing is that I seem to attract clingy men to me like a moth to a flame. (I suspect it's because I seem approachable and open-minded?) It's exceedingly rare that I'll meet someone with similar expectations as myself, and when I do there's no romantic compatibility.

For what it's worth, most of my dating nowadays is through online apps so that's probably why it's such a mixed bag. Friends and family have said it's because I just haven't found someone I'm crazy about, but I dunno. I know there's no real solution to this conundrum - nor am I the only one to ever experience it - but I felt like getting this off my chest! The struggle, is real.

On the bright side, that one dude who I saw eye-to-eye with but had no romantic connection? He once told me on a date that, ""I figure if I'm feeling this way about something, then there has to be at least one other person out there who feels the same way."""
I'm not chasing any more.,"Okay, so I guess this year I have been thinking a decent amount about relationships/dating. I am a 25 y/o Male and I do lots of exercise, both physically and mentally, and am always trying to improve myself. 

So how does dating/girls fit in to this? The current dating climate is an extremely biased one in favour of females, nowhere is this represented more accurately than on Tinder. I have used Tinder in the past and it always made me feel dirty, like why do I have to think of a clever opening message in order to warrant a reply? 

I am not inferior, nor do I have to prove anything to you in the hope that you give me the grace of a response. Fuck that. 

And then there is the club scene. Personally I have enjoyed much more success/enjoyment from meeting girls irl when out, and had some fun. But today I was volunteering and chatting to a female colleague, we were discussing this topic and she said that she doesn't particularly enjoy getting approached by guys in clubs (she's actually a lesbian) but if she doesn't then it can damage her confidence when many of the other girls in the club are getting approached. 

I mean, I respect her honesty and I like her as a friend. But is this the female mentality nowadays with regards to guys? We are simply used as a tool for validation whether that be through a Tinder swipe/message or an approach in a club? 

Anyways, it kinda made me realise that I am doing a disservice to myself by chasing girls. Its empowering to live a life where you are improving social skills, making new friends, learning a language, getting stronger both physically and mentally, travelling etc. Its not empowering to chase girls in the hope that one of them will like you enough to date you. 

So whatever, from now on I am not using dating apps, not asking out girls unless they are making it extremely clear that they want me to, and not making dating a main focus in my life. I would encourage others to do the same too! :)"
When did cheating become so mainstream?,It's the thing to do now. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one genuinely disgusted by it. I meet more married/taken men that are cheating on dating sites than I do singles!
PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIGNS AND LEARN TO LET GO,"If the person you’re dating is showing red flags, leaves you on read, left suddenly, not valuing you, etc. it is a sign. Whether it be from the universe/God/whichever religion you are, it is a sign that the person is not good for you and you dodged a bullet of potential heartbreak. THEY ARE NOT THE RIGHT ONE. There will be someone else who can love and make you happier. Learn to let go and live on. Remain calm and keep your peace."
"I know this is crazy, but I think she's my soulmate. How do I approach her without coming off as a creep?","Okay, so here is some background. When I was 12 years old, my mom sent me to a summer camp where we spent 11 nights in the woods. I didn't know anyone and other campers were mean to me. Except this one girl. She spotted me sitting alone and came over to talk to me. I thought she was the most beautiful person I'd ever seen at that point. She told me her name and we spoke for all of 5 minutes. Over the years, I've thought of her here and there and have even dreamt of our encounter on occasion. I've tried Facebook searches to find her but without her last name it's impossible. But last night I dreamt of her again. This time, it was different. It felt so real. We were both adults and getting married. Anyway, when I woke up I hop on Tinder and there she is. I swipe right and it's a match. 12 years later and I've finally found her. This is crazy. What do I say? Should I see if she remembers me? I don't want to come off as creepy.

UPDATE: 

We're finally gonna meet up. I asked her to go to Summerfest with me next week and she said yes."
I really regret not just shooting my shot,"I (25f) used to go the gym almost every day before everything shut down. I’d often see this cute guy there, and I’m pretty sure that I saw him checking me out sometimes too. Plus one time he was talking to his friend near me (I swear I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop!) and from what they were saying, it sounded like he was single.

I tried to work up the courage to talk to him, but I always chickened out. I go to a climbing gym, so people are generally friendly and it’s common for people to strike up conversations with strangers. And I reminded myself that there was no pressure because I could start out friendly and just see how we vibe. Yet I’d still get too scared to do it! It felt like I had an unlimited amount of time, so I always told myself, I’ll do it tomorrow, I’ll do it next week, the timing isn’t right yet. This went on for months. 

And now everything’s shut down. Nobody knows when things will open. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. When things do begin to open again, gyms will be the last to open. I don’t even have his number or anything to contact him another way. Idk when I’ll see him again, and idk if he’ll even still be single by then. I wish I could tell my past self not to take those opportunities to talk to him for granted!! 

When things start to open up again, I want to make dating more of a priority. I know that there are lots of wonderful men out there that I’ll be excited to meet. But I can’t help but feel a bit of regret for not knowing how things could have turned out. 

Idk why I’m writing this except to vent. Also to remind everyone out there - especially my fellow ladies - to not wait around and just take your chance! I know I’ll be better about it from now on."
If a person tells you they aren’t ready to be exclusive take the cue and start dating around.,"I’ve been with a guy for about 5~ months now and even though he is awesome and fun to hang out with (the sex is incredible) he just isn’t ready to be in an exclusive relationship. Not even boyfriend/girlfriend, I’m just asking for him and I to only see each other.

Nope. Not ready. 

So I took the cue and have started dating around while still seeing this main guy. And honestly it has shown me what I like and don’t like.

Went out with one guy. Non communicative and extremely “meme” based. (All he talked about) 
Went out with one girl. Boring as hell with no ambition to change her current situation. (No job. New to the city. Poly but has never kept a relationship over a year) 

Nah not for me. 

So this week I have a date on Friday with a guy and he is taking me into the city for some show and I’m excited for it. We’ve text over the past week and he seems pretty rad. 

But I am still seeing the 5~ month guy. He took me on a date this past weekend and honestly it was so much fun and just normal. But still no exclusivity. 

All in all. Keep your options open while dating. Hell 5~ months guy might change his mind and he might not but either way don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Shop around. Find some really good eggs."
"Ladies be careful of the miserable, entitled and narcissist women over at r/femaledatingstrategy",If you don’t participate in group think or are part of a sub they don’t like they will ban you. They shit talk women that don’t agree with every single thing they discuss. And the term “pickmeisha” is racist af! Sorry not sorry!
Women who agree to a 2nd date but don't mean it.,"In the past few years I've experienced the following with women between 35-41. I'm including ages because I think it's important to include. Here's what has happened about 3 times: Meet through Tinder/Bumble/Match for a drink. Spend anywhere from 3-5 hours talking, laughing, seemingly having a nice time. Walk the lady to her car and ask for a second date which she accepts with perceived enthusiasm, then I get ghosted. One never bothered to return texts, just disappeared. Another took a long time to respond and said she wasn't ready to date. My pictures are recent and I think I'm a reasonably charming, easy-to-talk-to guy. Here's my question: Are some women afraid to say no when the moment arises? I'm assuming that they may have no interest at all but are afraid to say it on the spot. I can understand this behavior from women in their 20s, but I figured by the time they reached their 40s they may be a little more honest and forthcoming. Is there a fear that a man might freak out if she says no? It's been very discouraging. I've been on dates that seem to go really well but end up in disappointment. This has not been very good for my ego. Thanks in advance for responses :)"
Tips for guys based from my experiences,"Before I get destroyed, Let me preface this by saying this is MY opinion. Yes, I realize everyone is different. And yes I know guys prob do the same thing.

1) what girls say and do are different 

“I like when a guy constantly messages me. It shows he cares” (or some variation of this). No, they say this but when it happens they get scared, feel you’re going too fast, you’re clingy. And then they hit you with “I’m not ready. Still healing from blah blah blah.”

2) let the girls be the ones that move the relationship along. Just enjoy dating/sex until she brings it up. 

Don’t ask/say “What are you looking for?” “I really like/love you,” etc. See point #1. Sometimes girls might just want to have sex/fun at the moment but  feel like they can’t say that as an answer. In this case they will end it if they feel you want more. (She might change her mind after a some time being with you).

3) Tex her first (THE FIRST TIME). After that wait for her to initiate the conversations for a little bit.  Otherwise you’ll come off as desperate and she’ll be turned off since you’re an easy target for her. Once things start to get serious then start initiating texts/calls at a reasonable pace. (Also, don’t reply too fast (wait an hour or 3). But this is a per case scenario.

4) Have options! She sure does. This also helps you not obsessed (clingyness) over 1 girl. 

5) have a life outside of her. Hobbies! 

At the end of the day girls like their freedom and they like what they can’t have. If you’re constantly talking to her then she will feel trapped/smothered. 

I’m sure I have other tips but these are the ones on my mind right now. I’ve started having way more success since implementing these! Good luck!

Women tend to have higher physical standards for hookups and men created that monster.,"I've been reading on reddit how some guys think women have it good. No! OLD sucks for a lot of us. 

Me, 31F, do get matches even from hot guys but guess what they mostly wanna hook up and I want a relationship. It always leads to Nowhere Land. I stopped swiping right on those IG  model guys because of that. I've tried the whole ""no sex unless I'm in a relationship"" for like 7 months after I broke up with my ex (we were together for 6 years). I didn't get sex. So when I couldn't take it anymore, I picked the hottest guy who cared to know more than my name and had decent conversational skills. Does that make me a shallow person? Maybe but honestly IDGAF. 

I told a guy last week on bumble, 99% of guys here are only DTF (yeah bumble is slowly turning into Tinder 2.0) whereas a lot of women want relationships. So if i have to settle for something that was not my original plan, then you best believe I'd pick a guy I find hot. That would be his one fucking job.

 I've had my own share of ""average"" guys trying to fuck me only with no strings attached so let's not pretend they don't exist. 

Stop blaming it on women. Blame it on the other guys out there who made it rough for you because they are overly sexual when they approach us."
Stop leading your partner on after you lose feelings for them,"I feel like this is mostly a young person thing (I’m a 20M btw), and I see it most commonly in girls. They don’t want to hurt someone else’s feelings especially someone they may have dated for awhile, so if they start to loose feelings for the person they’re dating they just continue to go along with it half-heartedly, even though the other person might still be very invested and at that point just leading them on. It just creates a lot more issues later down the road when said persons lack of trying in the relationship actually starts to really hurt the other person and might ultimately lead to them cheating on the other person if they keep putting off a breakup because they’re afraid of rejecting or saying no to someone."
Is it really easier to meet girls/women at university?,"So I'm in my second year at uni (21 Y/O) at the moment and I'm constantly bummed out by the fact I am alone. I have always been reserved around other people (thanks to my high functioning Asperger’s), and generally only talk to a couple of close friends on the course. I want to talk to more people (especially girls) but I can't start conversations and have to wait until they talk to me - which happens once in a blue moon.

I live at home and, as you can well guess, am not the type to go out or socialise with people. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life, but have had crushes and been in love with girls before, it just sucks when that is not reciprocated. My lack of general socialisation has turned me into a cynic on the world, and I need a connection to make that better.

What doesn't help about living at home is I end up spending way too much time with my parents. They're literally the only people I'll end up soeaking to for weeks on end since most of my friends live quite far away from me. 

I might be romanticising the whole ""true love waits"" thing, but I need to escape the social paradox of shyness, as well as having a trusting, female companion. I have felt like this for the past few years. Any help with how to improve my self and approach people, or how to stop feeling lonely?"
Giving up online dating will focus on meeting women in real-life,"Hey,

Giving up on online dating, too much endless swiping and texting and more like playing casino than actually getting any results.

&#x200B;

Will focus on meeting women in bookshops, cafes and gym.

Just my 2 cents"
I met a woman whose 6’ tall and isn’t afraid of dating someone shorter than her,"So I’m 5’6” and normally get told I’m too short whenever I start talking to a woman taller than me. Well I started talking to this woman I met on Hinge and we’ve already got pet names for each other, she calls me Nugget because I’m smaller than her. 

I met her and we’ve just clicked. Conversation is so easy, and she’s as big of a dork than me. We’ve already had discussions about things we want to do and trips we want to take together. 

She’s just awesome and I can’t wait."
How do you say “No” to a guy in a nice way.,"I drive Uber/Lyft part time. Picked up a two male paxs that proceeded to ask me to usually questions., age, native to the area etc. Ten mins before the ride ends one asks me if I’m single then asks if he could give me his number. I try to keep it professional when I’m driving and I generally just wasn’t interested so I said something along the lines of “I’m not really trying to date right now and I don’t want to take your number and not call so I’m going to keep it professional and decline.”  Then we rode in awkward silence the rest of the trip. I saw them looking at my face trying to gauge a reaction. The whole thing felt weird. I felt like I was nice but maybe it could have been ..idk “cleaner.” He wasn’t unattractive just too young for me and we weren’t really flirting so it came kinda left field. Plus I could tell he was shy because his friend said first “My friend has a question for you” which is a typical shy guy move. 

Reading these subs help me understand how hard it is for guys to talk to girls and I felt a little bad for how I said it. Guys, What’s a preferred way to get a rejection?"
26/F/Lonely,"Hello reddit,

I've just completely purged my social medias because I no longer feel the need to keep them. No one talks to me. No one goes out of their way to contact me. I feel as if I'm talking to a wall at certain points. I just don't understand why I can't keep people in my life. Naturally I'm not a shitty person, I'm actually very selfless. I always tend to put other before myself.... Maybe that's the root of my issue....

I just want friends. I want someone I can trust and I don't know how to put myself out there and I don't know how to appeal to people in a way that will make them want to stick around.

For some reason it just feels like no one wants to deal with me or be a friend to me and i have no idea as to why ....


*Update: I now have an Instagram which is x.tva.x 

I decided to give it another shot as far as meeting friends and trying to keep in touch with ones I really enjoyed. Plus, Reddit people seem cool 😊"
Got stood up tonight,That was cool. Been talking to this girl for a week. She asked me to hang out and I canceled plans to do so. Set a time to meet at a bar a couple of hours ago. She never showed and stopped responding to messages. That’s cool I guess. Had a couple of beers and it was a Pokestop. Man this shit hurts. Online dating sucks
Asked her out.,"I’m a pretty shy person when it comes with ladies. But I finally asked a girl to the movies that I’ve been wanting to go with for a long time. She’s a barista. So as I went from doing errands I grabbed some dinner at at store. And there’s a Starbucks kiosk in the store. I got my coffee after my groceries. I didn’t even think or expected her to be there that day, but she was. I ordered my coffee and as I waited we talked. Just as she gave me my coffee I asked if she saw avengers. She said she did but really wanted to see it again. I then asked if I could take you to se it? She said YES!!. Gave her my number and said bye then left. I had a tiny boost of confidence and used it to my advantage. Thought y’all like to hear a good story. 
Thanks"
Worst dates you’ve ever had?,"I was talking to this girl for a couple days on Tinder and agreed to go on a date and meet up for coffee. 10 minutes into date her friend comes running up to our table saying she needs to leave immediately because her house was on fire. She immediately got up and left. We were 2 blocks from her house and there was clearly no smoke from a house fire at all. I texted her and called her out on it and she said it was the best way she could think of to get away from me. We had been laughing and having what I thought was an enjoyable 10 minutes prior to this. 

Apparently honesty is a foreign concept for people and they feel easily provable lies are the best option. Definitely the worst and weirdest rejection I’ve ever had. Before this I never thought the whole friend faking an emergency was something people actually did. 

I’m curious what some of the worst dates any of you have had?"
Dating in your 30s is weird...,"It's also tough. It's also confusing. You can have a career, financial stability, be subjectively attractive, fit, have enough hobbies to make you a well\-rounded person, be social, put yourself in environments where you'd think you'd meet someone, join all the dating sites and use all the apps... and still, nothing. I'm halfway through my 30s now, and the spot I'm in is where it's like of course I want to meet someone, but at this age, I get easily  exhausted at the thought of putting in a ton of effort only to realize there's usually little to no reward in it pertaining to resolving my dating life. It's almost as if there's more unnecessary stress and less courtesy when all you're trying to be is a human trying to genuinely connect with another human.

This is not being pessimistic either, but just a fact of how eventually dating wears me out easily at this stage. I have friends where the process has been pretty easy, so seeing that doesn't light a fire in me either. One friend of mine who is a girl who never dated in her entire life until two years ago signed up for Match and met a guy within two months. They're living together now and very happy. Another friend of mine married a girl who accidentally messaged him on facebook because he had the same name as a former college friend of hers, and one thing led to another. That sort of easy, effortless strike of luck *never* happens to me haha

I still put myself on dating sites every now and then without expecting much, and always look for opportunities out there in the real world to potentially be introduced to someone new, yet I would be lying if I didn't say there's also those nights where I see that things aren't changing, I get tired by that thought, and really don't care."
Don't ghost people,"Girls, and guys, if you don't like someone, don't ghost them. Just tell them you would rather stay friends.
I've had a girl tell me after a date that she wanted to stay friends, and I got over it in like a minute because I knew exactly where she stood and I appreciated her telling me. When you ghost someone, it feels shitty because for 2-3 days, they are still hoping you respond, and then after that, they just hate you. "
Being honest about your feelings can get you two very different reactions.,"So, I've had a lot going on in the past 2 months.  I was casually seeing two different women when I realized I:

A) felt nothing akin to romantic feelings developing.  I was never super excited to spend time with them.  I enjoyed it, but I wasn't super sexually attracted to them.

B) Still had feelings for the last person I was with (over 6 months ago).

I felt this was unfair to both of them and told both of them (separate texts) that I wasn't feeling it and that I was sorry but I had some unresolved issues to work on, etc.  I explained as politely as I could and was upfront after about a month/month and a half of dating them.  It's always tough to break bad news to people, especially because you feel guilty.

Girl A: Flipped her shit, cursed me out, and told me to lose her number.  I had told her from the get go that I was emotionally unavailable but she apparently thought it was different than I said.  I don't blame her for feeling like a stepping stone, but better to tell her now.

Girl B: Totally understood and she was just finishing her divorce papers and we parted on friendly terms and are cool enough to be friends.  Similar interests, views, etc.  She was thankful to me and said that she was in a similar place as well and things were casual.  



(Probably preaching to the choir here).

We talk a lot on this sub about being forthright and honest with others, but the thing is, sometimes, we're afraid of how others will react.  Just be honest with people.  It's hard, but it's worth it to treat them like the adult they are.

E: I did tell them as soon as I realized I was emotionally unavailable. I took a couple days to really process and look inward to make sure it was that and I was telling them them my truth."
I just want someone to snuggle,I don't even want sex I just feel so deprived of human contact I want someone that I can love with all of my heart and hug and cuddle and never let go.
I can’t stop laughing about a date I was just on; I think this is a great reminder not to take ourselves too seriously.,"A local online friend asked me to see a movie; I personally think a movie is a less-than-stellar choice for a first date, but I decided to go anyway and enjoy myself regardless. Though I couldn’t talk to him as much as I would have liked, he was attractive and it would still be something fun to do.

The first red flag was that he was twenty minutes late. I didn’t raise a fuss over it, as we wouldn’t have to sit through as many previews, but saw him eventually arrive in the building wearing sunglasses. Because he had a cap on as well, I was debating with myself whether or not it was him when he texted me from 100 feet away, “Over here”, rather than coming to me or even looking at me. I walked up to meet him, and he was dipping tobacco in his bottom lip. I stifled laughter as I tried not to think about the fact that he looked like a squirrel storing food, or the fact that his teeth were blackened with nicotine. At this point I was thinking “Fuck this” before we even reached the popcorn stand, but decided that I would have fun watching the movie anyway.

After the movie, he had to use the restroom and boredly placed his monster-sized Icee into my hand as he went into the loo. When he came out, he walked away from me without a word. I returned his Icee to him and did my best to make conversation; he barely made eye contact and it was considerably awkward. Think The Office.

I can’t stop giggling to myself at work, thinking about the big ass Icee and the whole situation. I wish him well, but it’s a no from me. I see it as a great lesson in taking things like this in stride and having a good chuckle about it. It was an experience at best. 

Anyway, I just wanted to add a little lightheartedness to this sub, as I know dating can be tough and even scary. We’re all trying to find our fish, and the seas can be rocky. 
I wish you all luck!



"
Blocked out of the blue,"I was recently talking to this guy I had met. The conversation was going really well, we had a lot in common and had made plans to get together within the next few days. Then out of nowhere he blocked me on everything! We went from talking consistently to nothing in a matter of hours. 

Why oh why can’t people just say when they are no longer interested instead of just leaving someone with more questions."
So i recently learned that dating and being boyfriend/girlfriend are two separate things.,I truly had no idea and still would like some more explanation on but I always thought they were the same/interchangeable. Turns out I am wrong lol
I hate dating.,"I wish there was just like a heart over my soul mates head so when I saw him I could just be like 'ok, here we go'."
What are some things your ex or SO did that seemed sweet in the beginning but turned out to be red flags?,"My ex wanted me to sign up for the same running app he used so we could “keep each other accountable,” but he later used this to track my whereabouts. Anyone else????"
Just curious... What do you really want to know about the girls you date?,"Whenever I started dating a guy and they asked me generic questions, I couldn't help but think that they probably care more about knowing other things. I could totally be wrong about that, but I know that there are things I want to know about the guys that I don't ask in the beginning. What do guys really want to know about the girls they are starting to date, that they don't actually ask? Basically, If guys could ask girls anything without fear of being judged, what would it be?"
"He is not chasing me, but allowing me to chase?","What does it mean if a guy is not actively chasing me, but is responding when I am pursuing? Is this a bad sign? I tried a few times to not make an effort (for example not text him first) and he will not text me first. But when I pursue him, initiate the flirting with him, he seems interested and responds/asks me out. But it's draining because I feel like it's me who has to get his attention first.

EDIT:

update on situation now that it's almost been a year. After hanging out a few more times and going on another date still getting hot and cold behaviour, decided to not text first and he ended up never texting me. Saw him out of the blue at a club dancing with a girl. Definitely decided not to text him. Until recently I responded to a social media post of his. Little chit chat. He ended up moving away like a month after which is probably why he wasn't that invested in the long run (I get the feeling he was just bored and I was a nice ego boost). He apologised for leading me on. And that was that :)

If a guy isn't chasing he's not that interested, or he's shy."
"It might just be my gf, but dating a first-timer is the most chill dating there could ever be.","I think people kinda change when they go through multiple breakups. They subconsciously start looking for problems and drama because that's what they're used to. They also tend to get obsessive and suspicious about the smallest things. Of course, I could be completely wrong, but I think that stuff is generally missing in people who date for the first time.



No drama, no whining, no fake feelings or illogical behaviours. Just straight-up genuine love. I don't even think we've ever seriously argued, most of the time we just laugh and mess around. It's been like that for two years now.
 


I also compare her to me. I've had a few ex partners and sometimes I don't even realize what stupid things go through my head and how obsessive I get. Things that she doesn't even notice because she doesn't know drama. And then I realize how stupid I am sometimes. But at least I can control that and don't let it go beyond my mind. That's why we've never fought. And the fact that she's generally an amazing person.


I'm not really sure where I'm going with that. Maybe I want more people to realize how stupid and childish most ""issues"" in relationships are. Most likely they're not issues, you just make them be."
"Wish me luck, ladies and gents.","Since my last relationship, I've been ghosted, catfished, stood up, and gaslighted. I haven't had a second date in almost six months, and I *finally* found somebody worth the second date. I've got a good feeling. 

Wish me luck though, because I **really** don't want to screw this up.

Edit for grammar and Update: It went well! She's going to stick around for a while. Thanks everybody for the well-wishes and good vibes, I wish it all back to you!"
19 and a loser,"My 19th birthday is fast approaching and I’m getting anxious. 
The majority of my friends are moving away for university and I’m on a gap year, but I don’t start traveling until December. 

I have a part-time job but aside from that I don’t have anything to do on a day-to-day basis.

I’ve never been in a relationship or been kissed for that matter. I’m scared of being lonely - I’ve tried to talk to guys but they’ve never returned anything :(
It’s embarassing - all my high school life, I compared myself to my best friends, I was a late bloomer but, they always seemed to be surrounded by boys :((

I just ugh what if it doesn’t happen ? What if I reach 20 or 21 without ever having anyone ? It’s weird and I hate it"
I don't think I've ever had something so hurtful done to me.,"I'm shaking from anger right now. About three weeks ago I met a guy on Bumble. He seemed great, we met up the day we matched and genuinely had such a good time together, he was constantly complimenting me on how amazing he thought I was. He was extremely mature and respectful to me, treated me insanely well. He goes to a military academy (supposed to be a ""man"" of **~honor~**, right) and just recently graduated, so I couldn't see him for two weeks because he had to quarantine but we had planned out a great overnight trip together to get to say goodbye to one another. 

He talked to me constantly every single day, asked me how my day was going, what I was up to, all the like. Was genuinely invested in having conversations with me, telling me how he was so excited to see me, planning our trip, etc. 

Tonight I bought him beers to celebrate his graduation and have been prepping/getting excited to see him for the past two weeks. 

The trip was tomorrow morning. 

And you know what just happened? 

**He blocked me on every social media platform and when I texted him to ask what was up, he sent me paragraphs about how he was having issues related to his ex and he felt like a horrible person for hooking up with me when we first met and that he wants to change. I explained to him that this absolutely was not acceptable and he basically told me he hated himself and that he was extremely sorry. He tried to explain himself and ask for forgiveness because he didn't want to hurt me and thought blocking me would be the best way to do it.**


Sure, I didn't know him long. I'll get over it. But to have someone lead me on all day every single day for two weeks, to get so excited for a trip, to buy him congratulatory beer and watch his (very long) graduation because he asked me to, only to have him do this?

I gave him FOUR chances (two of them today) to back out of our plans. He chose THE most cowardly option. 

We went back and forth for a bit but I've been on delivered for a while so I think he may have blocked my number as well. 

I'm in utter disbelief. 

I just needed to get this out. I know it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of things but I'm so sick of being hurt by people like this. I try to see the good in everyone and trust people and this is what happens."
She had a boyfriend the whole time.,"Long story short, she(23) moved here from California about a year ago. I(20) met her 4 months ago(she asked for my number). We've literally done everything together for the first 3 months (only had sex once). Met some close family members and everything. But about a month ago she ignored a text (and I'm not the type to double text ever so I just let it happen) still hasn't texted back in a month. 

So yesterday I see her posting on her instagram story that shes with this unnamed guy and I thought it was a family member (because I stupid). Later on that day she posted on her feed something along the lines of ""my honey bun came to visit me from California ❤❤"" with a picture of her and the guy hugged up. She moved from California a year ago again.

The last time I've seen her was January 10th, its February 12th.

Now what's weird is that I'm not blocked or anything like that. Also I found out she has post notifications on for my story and she, without fail, is the first person to view what I'm doing within minutes on posting. 

Am I just the side chick who fills in when this guy isnt here 😂😂

Her and I have never talked about being in a relationship or any previous relationships ever. And I've never asked her to be my girlfriend 

(Heads up I'm not worried about loosing this girl, I already lost lmao, just curious what your take on this is)"
How exactly do you go in for the kiss?,I’ve heard people say that “he kissed me at the end of the date”. For me it’s always been “thanks for taking me out and I had a really good time” and then a hug and I don’t know what to do from there. I’m thinking right after that asking “can I kiss you?”
Asian mom,"Tonight my mom called me while I was at dinner with my man (since August) inquiring about my leased vehicle that is due at the end of this month. I told her that I was bringing it to the dealer next week to get evaluated for a potential new lease. I’m a 29F who got into this last lease with my ex fiancé (broke off last June) after trading my fully paid car off for it. The lease fell on me as it was in my name and I have barely been able to afford it on my own. Fast forward back to tonight, she asks me if my new boyfriend will be paying for my new car. 

With a couple glasses of wine in me, sitting at the communal table with my guy I start going into it with my mum a bit heated, asking her if she’s actually serious in mandarin. She proceeds to say she’s joking but I am clearly irked now - she’s constantly pushing her traditional Asian ideals on me (find a man with money to take care of you type of shit). 

I honestly can’t take this bullshit from her anymore and can barely stand being around my family. After ending the call with her I immediately and regretfully spilled the details to my boo and just felt like I brought our mood down - although he continued to still be so supportive of me. I feel like I shouldn’t have reacted so aggressively during the conversation with her but just don’t know how to stabilize my emotions with what she constantly throws at me. In turn I feel so bad for laying this all down on my boyfriend. Venting and seeking consolation. Does anyone go through the same ordeal with Asian moms? Does she honestly just not respect me or does it go beyond that? Obviously there is a lot more background info missing but it just seems to be a constant with her, I feel like I have never gotten the right guidance in order to have healthy relationships. I don’t want to blow it with my new boo and really need to learn how to balance this."
Some important advice for lonely singles,"I've been spending the past 2 months trying to get over a girl that broke my heart. She played me for a fool and used me for emotional support and intentionally kept me around while she was out chasing another man and as soon as he was willing to take her back, I was last weeks garbage. I felt distraught and like thr whole world was against me. I couldn't trust people, I couldn't sleep right, and every day I saw her was like a kick in the head. She had me under her thumb no matter what and I lived day to day praying that she would reconsider.

But then I realized something...my self-worth. I started thinking about how a woman that would intentionally play with people's emotions like that isn't someone that deserves my love and affection and certainly not my time. I realized that anyone who rejects me is missing out on something amazing and any girl that breaks up with me is losing the ""greatest good they're ever gonna get"" (5 points if you get the reference).

I also realized that I can't live my life trying to be someone that I'm not. I sat around trying to become the ideal man and ""Chadify"" myself in an attempt to make my chances with women better instead of just being myself and loving me! I love anime and retro video games and terrible movies and netflix comedies! Nobody can take that away from me and anyone who tries is a waste of my time. I refuse to hide my loves for the sake of those who didn't appreciate them to begin with.

It's not always easy to make a move and change your life or your mindset, but all it takes is one change to turn around your entire life. Today, I went out and got a haircut and a bunch of new clothes, completely changing my look. Now, I love the way I look. I ended up texting a girl that I think is cute that I work with asking to get lunch later this week and lo and behold, she was pretty happy about the idea. That's just an example of how being confident and going after what you want, whether it'll work or not, is incredibly important.

This is for everyone who is going through some pain and feels like nobody likes you or that you'll be alone forever; first, there are people that like you that you'll never know about unless you talk to people and read their body language. Second, it just takes time. Don't rush it and don't put people up on pedestals as though they're unattainable. You never know who may have a hidden crush on you!

Long story short, love who you are. Love what you like. Embrace it and even display it! More importantly, don't let people walk all over you!

Hope this helps someone."
Do not follow/friend request someone you find on a dating app.,"I do not have my last name, or social media on my dating apps because I do not know you, so I don’t want you to find me if we haven’t matched.  I am not interested in followers.  I do not need likes.  It’s a dating etiquette that maybe isn’t as a ‘big deal’ to some, but it should JUST be the default if I have no trace of where to find my social media ... which is private.  

I hope I am not the abnormal here.  I know there are people that put their accounts on their dating apps and to each their own.  Those people want followers.  Follow them instead.  Thank you."
How to avoid falling for everyone...,"How do you avoid putting women on a pedestal and falling for all the ones you find attractive.  
  
If a woman is attractive, I want to spend time with her and share mutual attraction, but they are never attracted, how do I detach myself from people I don't know, how do I consider them as simply other human beings whilst they seem to hold everything I never had, aka, mutual attraction.  
  
How do you avoid getting infatuated with every people you find attractive?"
[Update] I Quit Dating In Virtual World,"Quick Recap: Cute guy on  NY Subway approached me we had a date and sparks were flying!! I had to tell him that he needed to have his “fun” because it’s a natural process for him but I had gotten out of a relationship prior to meeting him and I had to be mature about the sparks but that I didn’t want to be part of his “fun” process. Because of him that’s how I found out I want to meet my significant other in the real world n not virtually.

2019!!! not even two hours in he bumps into me at a random Subway Station in Manhattan crowded with people. We took the train together and he kept saying to ppl he was with, I just keep meeting her in the subway this must mean something. We talked about music mostly and how we where doing. He asked me out for a date. Wish Me Luck Internet!!! 

Happy New Year!

Do girls have a hard time holding eye contact with a guy they find attractive?,"So last night, I (22M) was hangout with some girls (F22) that have been my ‘friends’ for about a year or so. We were just casually chatting in one of their apartments and I noticed that the girl I find attractive seemed to struggle with holding eye contact with me. She would be talking and would look at me for a couple seconds then like nervously look away and keep doing this. Do girls find it intimidating when guys hold eye contact, or is this a sign that she may find me attractive? 

TLDR; A girl that I’m into, was having a hard time holding eye contact with me, while we were talking."
Happy with relationships,"After an entire of month approaching women in grocery stores, at my university, coffee shops, beaches, book stores, libraries, gym, etc. I’m happy to say that I’m ecstatic with my progress relationship wise. All it took was just MASSIVE action. I’ve gone on various dates and been with multiple amazing women this month. I lay in bed now at night thinking “I can’t believe I did that! Haha” Or I wake up and I see this gorgeous beautiful girl.... and honestly I just wanted to say I’m genuinely happy with my dating life now. I’m happy with my life all round in general."
"There seems to be a echo chamber of negativity, defeatism, and general antagonism on this sub. I (30M) thought I'd drop in some positivism, from someone who once came from that same dark place.","Hey guys,

I've been perusing this sub on and off for years, as I've attempted to float in and out of the dating games for past decade. 

As I've mentioned in the title of this post; there are so many submissions that are consumed by negativity: ""I'm giving up!"", ""There's no one out there for me?"", ""Why even bother?"", ""Women/Men are so ""X"""". These are common statements you'll see creep up pretty much daily. And as someone who came from that head space, I GET IT! For the past 10 years of my life, I gave it an honest effort to try and get into the dating game. I was a nerdy, socially awkward, introverted, person. Years of flirting, unsuccessful attempts in asking someone out and getting shot down... by the end of it all, I was jaded, defeated, and honestly thought, ""Fuck it why bother, this is bullshit"". I remember in University, one of the strategies I used to try and help me get used to rejection, was if I randomly saw a cute girl, I'd politely approach them, and say something like, ""Hey, sorry to bother you, but I just had to ask, would you be interested in grabbing coffee or tea with me sometime?"". I think I asked something like 20-30 random girls, and I got shot down almost every single time. I remember downloading Tinder, and Bumble, and trying that out; I seemed to make 0 progress no matter how *""hard""* I tried, so as you can imagine, by the time I was getting into my late 20's, I fell into that same dark place.


But here's the thing guys, when has there ever been **ANYTHING** in this world that was actually **WORTH** something, not required some hardship, and effort?


I took a couple years and forgot about dating, forgot about the negativity it brought forth into my life, into my defeatist attitude, and I focused on what made me happy. I got into the best shape I had ever been with regular exercise and a good diet, I played the video games I enjoyed with friends, and had a blast doing it! I decided to join a sports league at my local gym, something a bit out of my comfort zone, but something I had always wanted to try, I saved up some money and traveled solo. I can genuinely say, the past few years of my life, I woke up every single day happy. It's so easy to get lost in the echo chamber of negativity when it comes to dating, and that does nothing good for you, but spread that negativity into your life, and as a result it can absolutely effect that which you're working so hard towards. As humans, we have a natural desire for intimacy, social interaction, to be loved, and to love, so it's natural to focus on it. But when it begins to consume you, it WILL become a problem.


You know the typical response, *""focus on your own self-improvement, and dating will happen!""*


It took me years to realize this, but the reason isn't because a Man or Woman will randomly fall into your lap the more you focus on yourself, and your own improvement. It's because everyone can sense negativity, and positivity. If you are honestly, and truly satisfied and happy with your own state of being, EVERYONE around you can see it, and sense it. Likewise, when you're drowning in desperation, negativity, and defeatism, everyone around can tell. And that absolutely effects your dating life. Would you want to be involved with someone, whose sole purpose of happiness is based off singular need to be with someone? Who otherwise is not happy with their life, and spreads negativity throughout themselves and others? My guess is probably not.


I literally did nothing but spiral downwards and spin in place for over a decade before I realized this wasn't helping me, or anyone else. I focused on me, improving myself, learning new things, enjoying what millions of things life had to offer. Now, at 30 years old, when I attempted to get back into dating, guess what happened? I met someone. She's beautiful, smart, funny, when she laughs... I completely melt. I didn't try to change who I was, I still do the same nerdy things I did before, but I made sure to focus on my life, and really, truly become happy. And not only did it totally change my perspective on dating, but I can honestly say I felt complete... And now I have someone to share that happiness with. 


I know there are some of you who are older than me, and some of you who are younger, some which have had better luck at dating, and some with worse. But I guess the moral of this post is:


**TL;DR:** Don't get lost in negativity, don't give up, truly seek happiness and self-improvement, and others will want to share and enjoy that positivity with you. This life has so much to offer us, and dating is such a small part of it. Spread happiness and positivity to those around you <3. If it can happen for a dorky, reclusive, introvert like myself, it can sure as shit happen for you, but it takes work! I hope you all have great day, and good luck out there <3!"
Men who don’t want commitment: what makes you go out of your way for a fwb/hookup?,"I really want the guys perspective on this: if you know you’re not looking for a relationship, what makes you do (relationship) things that you know isn’t necessary for a hookup/fwb? 

For example: cooking food, always wants to hold hands/touching, cuddling, random kisses, remembering small details you’ve mentioned once when you guys are doing things etc. 

Is it for the sake of doing it, respect/courtesy? What makes you think it’s not you sending mixed signals? 

And ladies: would you rather your hookup/fwb not do all these extra things because it does cross between relationship/hookup boundaries or you don’t mind?"
"""I love your oriental eyes""","I'm an Asian American female.

Why does every girl I try to meet online try give the red flags before meeting?,The latest one is the girl I posted about yesterday with the mental problems. But today she told me she has to go see her probation officer. I asked her why she has a probation officer. She said it was because she lied about being raped.
"I hate being alone, but the thought of dating makes me sick to my stomach.","Ugh, it's such a terrible conundrum. I feel so completely and utterly lonely, and it's made worse by all my family and friends having someone. Fuck, though, dude, dating just sounds like a miserable experience. Especially since online is pretty much my only option. 

I still remember the last time I tried. It was shortly after me and my ex broke up. We had been dating for a month so I had been spared the bullshit for a bit. Jumping right back into that bullshit for 2 days had me all like, ""Man, fuck this."" You've always gotta come up with some clever opener 🙄, and then you feel like some dancing monkey who has to walk on eggshells while juggling chainsaws. 1 wrong word, 1 wrong use of punctuation, 1 mistake whatsoever, and she's gone. You finally get to where she says 'yes' when you ask her if she wants to go do something, but 9/10 times she just ghosts you when the time draws near. You're always having to compete with a million other guys, and they have the advantage of not being mentally handicapped. 

The kicker is that that is the easy part. When you meet her in person is when your dancing monkey act had better be spot-on. Unfortunately, my act definitely needs some work (on my first date of my life I asked a girl if she had any neighbors while I was holding a knife). I'm always super fuckin nervous. That's too bad, because it's all about first impressions, and I'm someone you've got to get to know first. If you suck at job interviews you will suck at dating as well.

Anyone else feel the same way? I'd really love to have someone I could spend some time with. Shit, but dating? No, way, dude. Fuck that shit."
How to disclose a disability in online dating?,"Okay! Backstory: 
I’m a woman in my mid-20s and to look at me, you wouldn’t know I am legally blind. That is, I have lots of functional sight (I can read, recognize people up close, etc.), but I’ll never recognize you from across the room, I can’t drive, and I walk into things, like walls and other people, a lot. I don’t use my cane as often as I should (even though it helps) because it makes the people around me act in bizarre and obnoxious ways, and I generally appear to have much more sight than I actually do. I can get away with “faking it.” My friends, family, and partners often forget I can’t see.
But, I’m getting a guide dog soon! I’m over the moon about it, but unlike a cane, I can’t fold up a dog and stuff him in my purse when the reactions of others become inconvenient.

Actual question: 
When it comes to dating strangers (usually online), I’ve always refrained from mentioning my sight until well into the first date, at the very least. I don’t mind disclosing, but I’ve found that even the most well-intentioned people have strange ideas about disability, and especially blindness, that I don’t want projected onto me before I have a chance to prove that I’m a fairly normal, aggressively independent person.
With a dog though, my normal “fake it” routine is being derailed. So, how do I bring up the “blind thing,” which I can no longer hide, without coming across as high maintenance? Particularly in online dating, how should I mention this? Would it be an immediate turn off? Should I include my cane or my harnessed dog in pictures and wait for them to ask? Should it be in my bio? Few people will actually say “I don’t date disabled folks,” but a majority of the population would rather not deal with it. The minority who prefer it tend to like “vulnerable”  people and are creepy as hell, and I certainly don’t want to attract that type more than I already do. 

TL;DR: I usually wait to tell people I’m visually impaired, but with a guide dog, I won’t be able to postpone that conversation. How do I bring up the “blind thing,” which I can no longer hide, without coming across as high maintenance?"
(asking women) -- Do you like it when a guy is going in for a kiss and lifts your chin with his hand?,"To be clear this is with the assumption that you are with a guy you like, not just some random guy at the bar or at the end of a horrible date  you just want to end.   

I heard from somewhere that women don't actually like this, I heard it a long time ago and I can't remember where but it stuck.   But more recently I have seen comments from women saying they really liked this when they are with a guy they like.   

I realize that no one can speak for all girls, and that more often than not communication and asking is probably better in general.  I'm looking for as much of a  general consensus as I can get."
Male-Female Double Standard re: rejections,"If a girl rejects a guy, it is because he is lacking in intelligence, attractiveness, moral values, earning potential, etc., and is overall just not good enough. If a guy reject a girl, his standard are too high re: intelligence, attractiveness, moral values, earning potential, etc., and just fails to see how good she is.

Friends are telling me to lower my standards (re: intelligence, success, moral values, and earning potential) but women on the other hand are valued and respected for having those standards.
Sorry. Just needed to rant!
"
What do YOU bring to the (dating) table?,"It seems like the past 2-3 weeks there has been a significant amount of posts along the same lines - asking for help:

​

- men/women who are 28-70+

- no dating or sexual experience

- never had a girlfriend/boyfriend

​

We all have different upbringings, and I realize that many people struggle with family probs, mental health issues, lack of employment, financial hardships, weight issues, etc. But the common goal for most in this sub is to find LOVE! To have someone care about you, accept you, and to have sex with is a human desire that is not easy for some to find, it may elude others for years, and some it may never happen for. I see the same advice on 'repeat' in all of the posts by these people, although I respect that they reach out and want to change and find love, there HAS to be some accountability. SO IF you fit in this category, please take note:

​

Saying ""I want to find a girlfriend/boyfriend"" sounds fine and dandy, but what can YOU do for a girlfriend/boyfriend? I think a lot of people really believe that because they have a desire to have someone to love them, they see others their age with someone, or they just want to not be a virgin - that is enough. It isn't. Past the age of 25, most adults have goals: they work, they are supporting themselves, they are independent. And past the age of 30, some adults are looking to settle down and start families. BE HONEST and take stock in what you have to bring to the table. Can you be/do all of those thing? Can you hold down a job and support yourself OR if it happens, a family? Can you pay bills? Grocery shop? Cook and clean? The very basics of living alone. Are you a fun person, interesting, not a bore? Can you afford to date? Not all things cost money, but for the most part they do...think about that kind of stuff. Notice I didn't say you have to be rich, have a high paying job, or a luxury car?! That's because that is a misconception. Being independent does not equal being rich. Don't confuse the 2 and use that as an excuse.

​

To get people to be attracted TO you, you have to BE attractive to others. If you aren't coming to the table with anything...outside of ""Im a nice guy/girl, I love to make people laugh, I care about others, blah blah blah..."" then you cannot expect someone who does bring more, to want to come to YOUR table with you. That isn't fair to either of you. 

​

Take the time to learn the social norms and graces. Please! This is no dig at anyone per se, but rest assured that if you are over the age of 25 and men/women continue to reject you, don't pay you any mind, or tend to ghost you repeatedly - it is something you are doing. The older you get without practicing your communication and approach skills IRL (not just online), the more awkward your personality will be - I don't care what your friends and family tell you. They are there to love you, not tell you the harsh truth. You can workout, have a great job, and your own place - but if your personality isn't developed, you are extremely awkward, some of you may be creepy, and aren't able to pickup on social cues or body language, do yourself and others a favor and take some time to learn. Put your wish to date on hold a bit, Get a therapist, get a life coach, get a dating coach, volunteer (with other people not animals or alone - so you can practice communicating)...take steps to improve YOU. People tend to smell desperation the minute someone starts talking, and there is nothing more creepy then a grown person who says off the cuff or weird things (or acts that way) because they have no clue what they are doing or how to do it. So give yourself the advantage by learning how to effectively speak to the opposite sex. Learn how to socialize. If you have anxiety or are socially inept, that's ok. Be open to advice and WORK on it. Not everyone has love fall in their lap out the sky. Don't fallback on it as a reason not to try to change. You want to be loved - do the work. 

​

The point of this is to say: IF you need a step-by-step playbook on all things 'dating' (from A-Z), then the typical post of ""I'm a 30yr old virgin, never dated, and I want to start now"" will NOT get you the results you want in this sub or in reality. I promise you that. That's why the advice in all those posts are the same thing...over and over. PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE TIME NOR THE PATIENCE TO HOLD YOUR HAND AND WALK YOU THROUGH EACH STEP IN GETTING ATTENTION, I'm sorry. Professionals get paid to do that, so find one to help you! Do your own research, proactively take steps to help yourself first. Go out and practice. You will fail, yes, like a baby learning to walk, but keep trying. If your mental health has always been a struggle, don't ignore that as important..it is. If you give up you can't expect results...good or bad."
How has getting fit/lifting bettered your dating/sex life?,"I always love hearing motivational stories from people who were lost in the dating scene until they focused on getting their bodies back in check. Whether it be casual or serious dating.

For me, girls seem to go nuts in the bedroom. Before when I had a dad bod, sex was just sort of meh. Now I've discovered that most women are freakier than me, and sometimes it's almost too much to handle lol. They go nuts when I take off the shirt, and theres no holding back 😂.

Also, being able to have more endurance and being able to last longer not only in bed but on activities such as hikes, bike rides, walks, etc. Those used to be 100% avoided date ideas but it opens up a realm of new date spots now that I dont get winded after 10 minutes of walking down a trail lmao.

In general I cant reccomend getting fit enough. I'd say 80% of peoples dating issues can be solved by dedicating yourself to looking good naked. You'd be surprised, I have talked to girls now that didnt give me the time of day before and all of their answers were ""you got more attractive"". Anyone can say looks dont matter but its science people, big arms and the ""v"" are the fastest way to a womens heart!"
Sick of being a means to an end,"If you’re tired of being used by people:
- start putting yourself first
- learn to say NO
- make decisions based on behavioral patterns not “feelings”
- totally ignore feelings of guilt 
- plan ahead & only accommodate others when it benefits you 
- cut all leeches with a zero tolerance rule 
#Loveyourself"
I don't like to compete,"Maybe its my family history of having neglectful parents. But I feel really disinclined to compete for someones affection in dating. That's why I have largely tapped out of the scene. If I know a guy is seeing multiple girls, I lose interest almost immediately. I don't want to be the most beautiful, the most interesting girl out of the bunch like literally ever. Lately I have even lost desire to dress up, put on makeup etc. Guys I date seem to even want to encourage a sense of competition in me, but I just cannot feel it. 

Strangely, in other aspects of life, I can be very competitive. But when it comes to dating, knowing that I'm the best out of a bunch for someone doesn't give me pleasure. The effect is in fact kind of opposite. I don't want to be liked because I'm wonderful. If someone chooses me, I don't feel like I won a prize. Why was there a competition in the first place? If this person has to deliberate, he wasn't meant for me. 

Of course, men like to date multiple women. I think this might be why I don't feel like investing or putting in efforts anymore. Getting a man just isn't very rewarding to me. "
Tinder Archetypes,"I jumped back into online dating and I've noticed a few patterns in some guys' profiles. It's like some are trying to be a different version of the same guy. I'm sure everyone does this to some degree, but it's interesting to see what ""archetypes"" are popular in your area/age group. 

If you've noticed a pattern in girls'/guys' profiles, add an archetype!

Do you feel unlovable?,"Sometimes I feel as though I have too many quirks to be loved. Like I make it difficult to be loved because of the way I act sometimes, maybe my sense of humor, or the way I get really serious out of the blue. Anybody else feel that way? "
Is it just me or is Tinder absolutely awful?,"Maybe I’m a little biased because I met my ex on Tinder, but I feel the app has gone down hill since I last used it 4 years ago. I feel like nobody on the app takes it seriously at all and are just doing it for the meme. My ex and I split last year and I’ve been using Tinder since November. I swear I’ve only met two people who I matched with since I started using it. Obviously I’m aware that less people are comfortable meeting with people due to COVID going around, but I’ve met plenty of matches from Hinge. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t think any dating site is perfect and there’s plenty of downsides to online dating in general. However, Tinder just seems particularly shitty. Maybe I’ve just been out of the dating game too long and I’m not doing it right? I’m only 25 so I’m definitely still in the target audience for Tinder. Anyone else feel the same way or am I just giving off “old man yells at cloud” vibes right now?"
Post-Date Depression,Does anyone else get this? I have been on three dates with this guy and I think he’s great. I went over to his apartment last night and we had a wonderful evening.  I guess I get kind of a “high” from being with someone who is interested in me romantically and then I feel kind of a “low” the next day. I think I am sort of anxious in the dating phase because I’m not sure where it will go and I hate wasting time. 
"Got rejected, feels good","Went up to this cute girl in my class this semester that I’ve been eyeing. We had a brief conversation, probably like our 5th conversation. At the end, I asked for us to go get food sometime and for her number. She hesitated and said we should go after class with a group of people. I took the hint, so I probably won’t ask again, but I feel good I got the courage to go up and ask, and in my opinion, that’s the important part."
"When dating, please be proactive in deciding whether you want a relationship or not...don't confuse the person you're dating","I have been dating somebody since January, it was so great at the beginning, and I really like him. I was honest about wanting a relationship/looking for something long term on date three. He seemed to be okay with it so we kept dating. 

Come time for the commitment talk, he wanted time, I gave it to him. He seemed confused and I get that sometimes people need more time. But after a couple of conversations, his confusion wasn't about me, it was about wanting to be in a relationship at all. I told him to start being proactive about it, and he did.

Today, after consideration he wanted to stop seeing each other. I feel so saddened, I thought we had a connection. Though I agreed with the decision, and if he hadn't reached it, I would have walked away myself. But it really sucks.

What sucks more and its something he failed to tell me is that his ""relationship that ended badly"" happened only a couple of months before meeting me. And ending badly meant that the ex that he lived with him destroyed his things, locked him out and his brother had to fly in to help him with it all.

I never stood a chance. I could've been perfect and that kind of experience would have left him not ready for more that soon. 

Had he proactively thought about this, had more self reflection and self awareness, the hurt I am feeling could have been avoided. I don't think it was intentional, I do think that it hurt could have been avoided entirely. 

So here is me venting and telling everyone out there, that please be proactive, because the person you are dating has feelings too."
How would you feel if you were out on a first date and she said she didn’t think you were compatible but that you would probably be great for her friend?,"Would you be okay with it and willing to see the friend or be weirded out or insulted, or none of the above? Assume the friend is equally hot based on pictures she shows you."
I just got ditched at a bar yesterday,"I thought things were going well. We went to the park and walked around for a couple hours and had some drinks that she brought. Then we decided to walk to a bar and we talked about a lot of things on our way there. Then when we got there she said she had to go to the bathroom and never came back. She sent me a text saying she didn’t feel the chemistry. The worst part is, this isn’t the first time this has happened to me. It’s really disheartening."
Giving up on dating apps and using my dog instead!,"So I just can’t get on with dating apps. My work is 99% males so no chance of meeting someone there. I’m a bit of an introvert and don’t socialise much. I spend a lot of time walking my dog. 
So I’ve decided to teach my boy a command (who’s that) and then he goes up to that person to say hello!
This is my new way to try and meet and talk to people who look interesting!"
First time dating without having sex immediately and I’m excited,"Edit: Its completely fine having sex immediately. I’m not saying its bad, thats how most of my relationships/fwbs went. Its ok, its not wrong, its not better, not worse. Im just excited to try something different.

So my first boyfriend and I we just fucked the first time we met, then afterwards went to the movies and then I started falling in love with him. It lasted 11 months and was overall pretty great but there was no build up or anything, just went right into it. I don’t regret that, it was a very positive experience, but now I’m going out on dates with a guy and I don’t see sex coming up immediately and I’m a bit excited.

It is going to be really interesting taking it slow and just feeling the build up of moments, and sort of the rush when it does. I don’t know, just thinking about that makes me giddy. Thats all. Have a nice day :)"
For the over thinkers!,"I've seen quite a few threads on here that run along the lines of ""I've been texting/just been on a date and the texting has just stopped, am i overthinking or have i been ghosted?"". We've all been there, some times its been a day, sometimes you've been firing off messages for 3 hours and suddenly its gone quiet after you said something risky and now your convincing yourself it's all over! Until 5 minutes later they fire back with a laugh crying face and you feel like a moron. So I thought I'd try and help by listing some legitimate reasons you're not getting a reply other then they don't like you. Just to put your mind at rest....

&#x200B;

They are convinced they sent the last message and haven't realised you'd replied yet.

They are driving

Their work doesn't allow mobile phones.

Unplanned naps

They attempted to clean their room and have found a new fascination with a useless item they had forgotten about months ago.

They are on a date (No reason they wouldn't be if you met them on a dating site).

They are trying to perfect the dance from single ladies because they finally got round to it.

They have got lost in a Reddit spiral of discovering new Subs.

Their flatmate has started a conversation about the person they are talking too and they busy talking about how much they like you.

Their flatmate has started a conversation about pizza and they busy talking about much they like pizza.

They are having some ""Me Time"" and it's taking far longer then they had anticipated.

They are trying to seem aloof.

They are writing lists in r/dating and thinking of pithy one liners is taking some time.

I got ghosted,"(27M) Not the first time I've been ghosted or done the ghosting, but it's the first time in a while that I was looking forward to going out on a first date. I just want to stop thinking about the fact I was so excited to meet someone new. I have my own online business so meeting women has become increasingly more difficult. I've been on a few dates during the past year but none really got me feeling this way even though I hadn't met the girl yet. I think I need to stop trying dating apps.

Sorry for the venting."
"Have you ever deleted your tinder account but not because you found someone, rather because you felt something was off?","Ive been on tinder countless times over the last five years. But lately I feel like something is off with my account. I don’t feel confident enough with it, i don’t get good vibes. Maybe I’m just feeling this way because I’m not in a good place right now but I was wondering if it happened to you too?
I often see the same people on tinder just with different accounts. What about? 

At first I wanted to make another account right away after deleting this one. But maybe I’ll just take a break since it doesn’t bring anything good in my life for now."
"(22F) first ever date, need advice","I matched with a guy on Tinder and for the first time we actually talked for more than 2 consecutive days and he asked me to get tacos. At the time I had to postpone for a test but he said we could work out the details later but it would probably be on a Friday/weekend. It’s now Wednesday and we haven’t set any details. Should I ask about it? I feel like recently I’m the one starting all the conversations... If we set a date/time, what does one wear to a taco date? I’m very short and kind of overweight and despite the fact that I put a full body pic on my profile I’m afraid he will be surprised when he meets me in person. Help!"
Just wanted to say something for the ones scared of making a move....,"If you're scared of being rejected, I know how you feel.  

I got rejected on the 11th by, and it kinda hurt.  This is probably my third or fourth rejection in my lifetime.  If you want, stalk my profile and read about how I kept on hesitating with other girls.  I realize now that the ones who responded are right.

You should go and just ask her out, and if she says no, either stay friends if you already are friends, or lessen your contact with her

Trust me, it's better to let her know how you feel and find out how she feels about you, rather than trying to decipher her actions in the hopes that she's hinting something.  In my opinion, that's just going to hurt **you**.

Yes, I know it'll hurt, and there's going to be some ""facing the music"" initially, but eventually you'll move on.  As others say, there are other girls out there.

**PS**: this is also a reminder for me because I really liked the girl I asked out, and there is still some residual hurting, if that makes sense.  But I'm close to moving on, and I'll have to deal with awkward scenarios and less contact with her, which is good because that means I can move on without being reminded of her.


Edit: bold"
anyone else having a hard time moving on right now?,"whether it be a breakup, ghosting or unrequited feelings — whatever your circumstance, anyone having a tough time moving on due to the current state of things?

not being able to go out, social distancing, it's all putting a huge weight on mental health and dating. and sometimes, facetime dates just aren't the wave.

so i was thinking of making this a positive type of thread. where we can all share some kind words to one another to let us know we're not alone in our struggles. moving on is tough, and the state of things atm can make it tougher.

just know you're not alone. time heals all wounds. <3

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------

**UPDATE: I just wanna say that i'm really glad everyone has found this post as a way to share what's been going on during this time and remind one another that we're not alone. I myself have had a tough time getting over someone, but there's light at the end of the tunnel. we just have to let ourselves feel. i'm so happy this thread's become a safe space for ya'll. <3**"
"If you’re getting mixed signals and you’re the one giving more energy, retract it and see what they do.","If you’re the one constantly messaging them or the only one who cares to make plans or else you don’t see each other.. or if their main communication is just viewing your story and replying to every other funny meme or thirst trap you post (guilty of trying 😬), just retract your energy and keep it moving. Go dead ass silent (literally don’t say anything or make a fuss... this does take a shit ton of self control and tact) and then you’ll see their true intentions... if they really care at all. I did that about 3 weeks ago and I haven’t heard from him since. I was confused for weeks, if not months about him because we had so much attraction and amazing sex. He even told me I was the best, gave the best head, I’d always think of him and grab food before I come over and even paid for our second date. If I could create a boyfriend for me, it would be him (goal oriented, hard worker, goofy, big downstairs lol). It really sucks when you want someone so badly, but you have to put logic before your feelings no matter how disappointing it is. 

Also, in my situation, if I reached out or asked him to hang... I always got a response instantly and was always a yes to hang out. It’s confusing and makes it harder to say “hey you’re just giving me the bare minimum” without sounding crazy, because they will just come back and make it seem like you overthink things. In my case, even though he told me he liked me and is very attracted to me there were a couple times he mentioned we could just be friends when I’d react emotionally (instead of being comforting or trying to work through things). If you pay attention, they may even tell you directly they aren’t ready to date or something, so don’t overlook it. Just listen to your gut. If it doesn’t feel right, then it’s not right. 

I saw a comment on a YouTube video that said girls get confused with this dynamic of overthinking and not understanding mixed signals, because we usually are the ones playing hard to get if we like a guy... but if a guy is doing it, it doesn’t mean the same thing and you should actually take it as he’s not as invested or interested enough.

I’m sure guys go through the same things, but this is just coming from your friendly single 29 year old female who’s been through a lot. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
He's hung up on somebody else?,"So, I met this guy on Hinge and it honestly was off to such a great start. Had two dates and they both went very well, we talked for hours on end with no awkwardness to the point where we both admitted damn... this is going way better than we thought. And then of course, after the second date (yes, we had sex that night for the first time... it was great) we were still talking over text and all was well. He told me he trusted me and even went on to tell me some personal issues that he didn’t have to tell me but I encouraged him to if he felt the need, which he did. It seemed as though he was taking me seriously, and I was taking him seriously despite the eventual hookup.

Anyways, he messaged me a couple days after saying that he fell for someone back in his home town before moving out here, and that he thought he had moved on and was ready to date but realized he wasn’t. He said he has feelings for me and doesn’t want to hurt me in any way, but that he didn’t want to waste my time. I was obviously pretty upset because he was the first guy in a long time that I could actually get along with and felt comfortable with. All he really said was that he needed time to himself... I can’t help thinking that it was something to do with me?? I’m kind of hoping he’ll come around and we could try again once he’s figure his stuff out... at the same time I only really knew him for maybe a couple weeks, but it sucked because he’s a good guy. Thoughts? Opinions?

We left the conversation at that, I told him he could reach out to me whenever and to take care of himself... so like... that’s it???? Should I still have some hope???? Ahhhhh I'm a hopeless romantic and this one kind of hurt despite the circumstances


Edit: he texted me today lmao but yeet"
"FINALLY at peace, excited, and have accepted the fact that I will probably not find a long term partner","almost 34 this year, been looking for a LTR for the past 12 years  (off and on). hookups, some LTRS that did not work out.

It all took a ton of work. nothing came into my lap. I never really met someone through friends. lots of dates with women that I Was excited about that were not into me. a few relationship where I wasn't really feeling it but kept at it because I thought things would grow (and they didnt). dating someone I was actually excited about  for about 3 months and it was an incredible experience - until she ended it. I'm the kind of guy that believes ""you just know"" and you need to find a women you are truly excited about, and the ones I have been have never been into me (or never longer than a few weeks) and its been 12 years, I think I know where I stand and its safe to say its probaly not going to happen.

and I'm already pretty much optimized. I'm in great shape, good job, good social circle, etc. I do love myself and I am striving to be my best self. But its just not doing it for the women around me that excite me, and thats I guess what it is. if anyone asks, I don't have unreasonable standards. I meet these type of women all the time. 

6 weeks ago, I woke up, and I just stopped caring. something clicked.  maybe it was the fact that I got TRULY excited about picking up piano again. I was also reading about some great travel destinations. I started getting excited about life more. looking towards the positive. I deleted all my dating apps. Ive done this before, but those times it was to ""take a break""; this time its different - its because I simply don't want to try.

since then, life has been so much better. There is a certain new ""peace"" that has overcome me. I'm excited about my career more, about my future path, about picking up music again. about re-connecting with some friends. about bringing value to peoples' lives and giving back.  I Started volunteering once every two weeks. I'm envisioning the next decades of my life as a blank slate that I Am free to write as I please with no contingencies on another person. the prospect of never finding someone, for some odd reason, just doesnt bother me anymore. in fact, it excites me - all the freedom I can have to myself to grow and do what I want.

I just want to re-enforce that, coming from someone (myself) that has always wanted a partner,  you can find peace/contentness at the prospect of not finding someone. I finally got over that hurdle."
I’m a 6’5 male and I struggle with my dating life...I hate when all of you guys think it’s just about height,"I’m tall and I’m also a little bit chubby so I’m not exactly in the best shape of my life but I hate this idea I always hear about being tall is the gateway to guaranteed success in romance. I have to work just as much as everyone else, and I’m dieting my ass off to lose the weight that is making me insecure. I have my own hoops I had to jump and I still need to put in a lot work in myself to be fully 100% comfortable in my own skin. The reality is, for men especially, being comfortable in your own skin is the most attractive thing, not just to women, but people from all walks of life. Everyone wants to be around someone with positive energy. I know it because I use to be thinner at one point. People get so wrapped up about their problems that they join a subreddit online with other men because they refuse to do the one thing that matters: work on themselves. I promise you I’ve struggled just as much if not more than other guys with dating "
Tinder is cancer,"Fucking hell, I’m a 26 year old man and I’ve met the worst people on tinder. I know this is obvious, just venting."
Do it by yourself,"As a longtime subscriber to this sub, I’ve noticed a lot of people asking tips on how to meet people, get noticed, and dealing with loneliness. Not that this is some new advice that’s never been dispensed before, or even something clever. As a matter of fact, I’ve seen many people suggest this before. I just want to reiterate how important and effective this is: Go out by yourself!

Go to the bars by yourself. Go to shows by yourself. Go to coffee shops and read by yourself. Go for walks, do this, do that, and do it by yourself.

First of all, it will help you get comfortable in your own skin. The first few times might feel awkward or uncomfortable, but it’ll pass the more you do it. You’ll notice over time that you’re more approachable, and you will find that you’ll be more confident in approaching others. It all comes down to enjoying your own company out in the open. 

For me, it was going to the bars by myself when I realized how easy it really was to meet people. And also, don’t be afraid of getting friend zoned. Actually, it’s a good thing to think friends first. Value your new friend as a person and not as a potential companion. If you value them and their time, it may turn into something more, or they may be able to recommend you to one of their friends. 

Go out by yourself with the intention of just being social and increasing your social network. This will build confidence and attraction, and before you know it, you may have someone pining over you. Tackle the problem yourself, and truly, put yourself out there."
If you are rejected,"If you offer your heart to someone and they refuse it, dont fret. Perhaps the reason is they were not deserving of your heart in the first place and the universe is guiding you elsewhere."
I may not have anyone rocking my world right now...,"... but I don’t have anyone ruining it either. 

Happy Friday, Reddit!"
Met a guy who feels like my best friend,"We started as friends. Know so much about each other because we shared openly at first with no expectations.

We developed feelings and now we are together.

We talk a lot because we never get sick of each other and genuinely enjoy talking. we call it ""intellectual crack""

is this a bad thing to communicate throughout the day a lot in the beginning of a relationship?"
Is it really that easy?,"So I see on this sub and many others how dating is tilted to favour women and how they hold all the power and guys seeking advice from women about what they want so they can get in with them. So my question is, Ladies, do you feel this is true?? Because I certainly don't... like at all.

&#x200B;

I am a woman and I 100% do not see how I am in control of this at all. I'm constantly getting ghosted, no replies to matches, on bumble I'll match with a guy and message him and almost 90% of the time that happens they either don't reply or unmatch me immediately after I send the message. When I do talk to a guy he will be talking and interested until he just goes into radio silence, or we'll go out on a date and he'll just constantly want sex the entire time basically, which sometimes is fine- I like to get laid. If sleep with them then they just slow fade away instead of being a grown ass adult and saying hey that was fun, but I'm not into pursuing anything more. I'm fine with that, but why is ghosting people so acceptable now??? It fucking sucks. I've never ghosted someone. If I don't want to see that person or talk to them anymore, I tell them. But I get ghosted constantly, seems no matter what I do. So Ladies, is it just me? Are the rest of you just having a smorgasbord of guys you pick and choose from? And they all just want to date you?  Is this as easy for the rest of you as they're are saying??"
[22M] Any advice for a guy who can't get any dates?,"I've tried every free dating site but have never got a match or reply. When I was at college I joined social clubs, such as the drama club, but I never met any women who were interested. I have been clubbing many times to try get my first kiss and/or have some casual fun but again no women were interested. 

In terms of looks, I'd say I'm average. I workout, have a trendy haircut and always make sure my hygiene and clothes are on point. In terms of personality, I'm an easy going, friendly guy. I enjoy movies, music, exploring the world of food and most importantly hanging out with friends.

Any advice would be much appreciated."
I heard dating is strange in the States. Is it true?,"I'm (M24) from Jamaica, and a friend of mine who was in the states for months told me trying to date is way different here than it is there. 

He told me that it's actually weird to just walk up to a girl randomly and say hey in the States. He said that it could be viewed as assault, as the girl ”the girl might not want to talk to you"" is that true? You have to meet women at social events and online. 

In Jamaica... It's weird if you don't approach women... You'll just be sitting there.. alone. If a girl doesn't like you she'll let you know or you might get a number that isn't let's say... Accurate lol. 

Personally, I love the rush! The anxiety you get sometimes before approaching a gorgeous woman. Even getting rejected, to realize that it isn't a big deal. 

Sometimes I go up to a woman say whatever comes to mind... Sometimes I stun myself... And her... Sometimes I say absolute shit and look like an idiot. It's fun. 

I really hope my bro is wrong."
"I don't think we have a hookup culture; We have a ""everything has to be perfect"" culture","There seems to be two camps:

1. I want everything perfect, but I can't find that, but I'm going to keep having one or two dates with tons of people until I'm really bitter and give up.

2. I want everything perfect, but I can't find that, so I'm just going to sleep with people.

People tend to know this, maybe subconsciously. They assume that if you're not in their camp, you must be in the other.

I had a professor recently make a comment about 'hookup culture' that is hurting relationships, and after some thought, I think it's this generation's narcissism and influence from sources more like Disney and maybe a misinterpretation of old concepts of romance and love.

Is anyone else in an isolationship?,"Several weeks before the Corona Virus pandemic began, I met a nice girl on OLD. We live about 40 minutes from each other but we work in neighbouring buildings, so organizing a daytime coffee date was easy. We hit it off and planned to go for a walk a few days later. Then we had a real date in her neighborhood on a Friday night which was awesome. It was reciprocated by a date in my neighborhood the following week. We were definitely hitting it off. 

Then..... lockdown. 

Ever since we’ve both been isolated in our homes, we’ve had FaceTime dates every night for hours. We’ve drank entire bottles of wine together and learned a lot about each other. This is a lot like Love is Blind except for the initial dates we had. We are both losing our minds wanting to see each other in person again at this point. I’ve never had an experience like this, but I think it’s a really interesting and healthy way to start a relationship. Time will tell, but damn this is a lot of fun and it’s making the isolation much more bearable. I was thinking, statistically, there must be some other new couples experiencing a similar situation. Anyways, stay safe and don’t be a Covidiot by going out in public!!"
"When he/she says they’re not ready for a relationship, they mean “not with you”","Those of us who become interested in someone only to find out (hopefully early on) that someone isn’t looking for a relationship, often means “not with you” — they’re waiting for someone better to propose the offer on. 

Think about it, we might interview for a job and they’re looking for the best candidate, why settle on someone who won’t stick around for less than 3-6 months? So they hold out and keep looking for something with longevity, instead of temporary.

But at the same time understand that a lot of people are indecisive and may not end up weigh all their options in the long run, they may come from states of vulnerability or even loneliness. That even you while a viable option, may not be a fit for them not because of who you are, but rather who they are — they may see themselves unworthy of being a partner in their eyes or perhaps breaking your heart in the long run.


As much as it’s a blow to you and your self esteem, understanding this will save you eventual heartbreak down the road. Continue to be the best version of yourself, and work on the things you feel you need to work on."
Red Flags to Look Out for in Online Dating,"I (25M) am by no means an expert in online dating but here are some of the red flags I have found that can help you screen out people:

1. If you are the one asking all of the questions and they NEVER ask anything about yourself. I have found that these individuals don't want to get to know you by text and don't turn out to be much better in person either.
2. Take really close note of their pics. Ex: I am not a huge drinker and therefore if a woman has three pics of herself out with friends at a party this is a clear sign we probably won't work out.
3. If someone's opener is anything in the ""hey"", ""sup"", ""hi"" ballpark then they are probably not going to be a great conversationalist. I have maybe found one woman who bucks this trend but for the most part this will hold true. 
4. If they are flaky over a chat they are likely to be flaky in real life as well.
5. People who tell you more in their profile tend to be the ones who care more. This may seem obvious, but many people still try to pursue that cutie who has nothing other than his or her name on their profile. I have found that people who want you to know them better will give you more info off the bat

I hope some of this was helpful and please feel free to disagree with me."
How Can I Start Dating?,"I'm 18M and I haven't really been into dating because I have social anxiety, but I would like to start dating. The problem is that I don't really know how to put myself out there or flirt. If anyone has some advice I would appreciate it."
Finding a someone in person rather than online.,"Is it just me or is the act of finding a significant other much more thrilling when it is done in person rather than online? I've used apps before to get in contact with women but I've never actually felt like I 'earned' their attention. It was as if I used the internet as a cheat code to get where I wanted with very little effort.

Part of me just loves that feeling of going through the motions of finding that right woman. From mustering up courage and getting to know her,  all the way to making the first move and asking her out (if she's receptive).  I do fear rejection but at the same time its prospect of that which makes me cherish the potential companionship even more. 

What is your opinion? "
Got left with a $60 bar tab last night!,"Fucking tinder dates are the worst. Met a guy for some drinks last night, after drinking a bunch of double whiskeys he excused himself to ""go to the bathroom"" except he left, and I was stuck with the tab. I mean I don't mind paying but come on bro."
Ghosted after 5 months,"I just need to vent and say that ghosting has to be one of the cruelest things one can do when dating these days. It really makes the other person feel totally insignificant and disrespected. Not to mention the agonizing that follows being ghosted, trying to figure out what possibly went wrong. 

I don’t understand why it’s so difficult to send a simple text saying it’s just not going to work out. Ghosting is a cowards way out and is very traumatizing to the person they do it to, especially if they were dating for months. It can completely kill ones self esteem and makes me not even want to put myself out there anymore. "
Be cautious ladies and gentlemen.,"I recently (Friday night) met a cute female at a bar.  We talked for a while, exchanged phone numbers and I went home and called it a night.

Proceeded to hear from her the next day (unexpected, drunken night at a bar doesnt usually work out)  and we decide to hang out.   All is great.  Learned that she seems to have her life together, drives a nice little range rover, makes her own money.

Saturday went well and she proceeded to ask me to hang out with a couple of her friends at one of the more expensive places in my area.  It's right on the beach.  I wasn't hungry but decided to go hang out with her and meet some friends.  

She ordered a double margarita (34 dollars) and steak and shrimp (38 dollars)  while I just drink my water.    

We get a bill and she starts freaking out about how she doesn't have money to pay for it when I handed her the check.    I didnt eat. She invited me.  There was never a thought in my mind about her wanting me to pay for her stuff.  I dont mind paying for a date.  But not when I'm not eating, and I was invited to hang out.  

So, be cautious.  Dont let some one take advantage of you like you're their personal ATM.  You'll find some one that isnt about what you buy them.  They will look for the comfort and commitment."
Well i did it?,"Well guys I think I got my first date in about a year! Was randomly swiping through bumble when this girl and I matched. We hit off really well. Lots of bad jokes and random talking. We started talking about how we only wear t-shirts and jeans(don't know how that came up). After awhile I asked here on date, but we had to find goofiest shirt we could find to the  date. She seemed to really get a kick outta of it. Hopefully it goes well. Wish me luck!"
A crazy date last night....,"I️ (34M) went out with this girl (34F) that I️ met online last night. We had drinks, talked a lot, then she orders shots. We drink more, then she orders more shots. She leans in and starts making out with me. We make out for like 30 min. Somewhere in there I️ agreed to a second date on Sunday. The waiter comes around with the check, I️ go for my wallet and she’s already paid for everything while I️ was in the bathroom (it was like $100). After we left, I️ texted her thank you and that it was an amazing time. She texts me this morning that she has tickets for our date on Sunday. Mind = Blown

TLDR: wild and awesome date on Sunday

"
Just say it.,"To be honest if you’re dating someone and aren’t interested just say it then and there and thats it. Not telling it, is much harder for your other partner to understand where you want to go with this relationship."
My partner self harms in front of me during arguments,"Myself (F22) and my partner (M22) have only been dating around 7 months. We have been living together with his family due to the current situation in the U.K.  

Whenever we will get into a disagreement or an argument (or even if I am being quiet because I’m tired or grumpy) they will get very upset and get very stressed. This usually leads to them banging their head off doors or cutting their wrists or hands until they bleed. 

I have no idea how to help them and I am feeling very alone in this. I don’t want to tell my friends or family incase they worry for me. I have discussed this with my partner and they have downloaded some mental health apps on their phone but I know that they won’t stop. I don’t think they know how much this is hurting me and making me feel so low.

EDIT: I used the term ‘they’ when referring to my boyfriend and I don’t really know why, probably because I typed this in a hurry. I’m sorry for any confusion caused. 

EDIT2: I have told my boyfriends mother about what has happened and she has had a very firm talk with him and told him to increase his exercise as a distraction right now and call up a counsellor. I have had a big talk with him about how this is unhealthy and almost toxic, he said he will go to counselling once everything settles down but for now is using mental health apps. I also don’t think he is doing this for attention as he is very embarrassed about it and wears long sleeves and only myself, his close family and friends know. He understands this is not healthy and is working to better himself. Thanks everyone for replying and offering advice x"
Long Distance (Should I buy the ticket?),"Please hit me with brutal honesty.

I recently spent 5 months in Chile and developed a 4 month long casual relationship with a university student there (I’m also a university student). When I left we discussed her coming to the US to visit me and my family. She’s been very excited about it, and has no doubts we should do it. She cried for hours after I left.

After getting back, I’ve been doubting in more and more. She’d be with my family and I for about 10 days. I also recently went on a date with another girl which ended in some making out and well... hand stuff. I’m not sure I’m as invested in it as she is and I’m not sure I want to drop $600 to have her come here. She also doesn’t speak any English and my family doesn’t speak any Spanish.

Please ask more questions if you have them and want to know more about the situation.

Update:

I told her not to come. She cried over FaceTime again, and I told her it wasn't fair if I wasn't as invested, she deserved more than I could give her right now. She said I thought about the future too much, but I was really just thinking about my present self. Then, she started talking about all the things she had to do in order to start arranging for this trip that I didn't even know about. She canceled a trip with her friends and started to doing an immense ton of work for the passport. I had no idea, and I didn't even appreciate it. I'm a selfish guy and I need to start turning it around. I hope by having this conversation with me, and pointing out the things that she's doing for me and the lack of things I have done for her, that she realizes that this is the right decision because she deserves more than I am giving her and that I'm not invested. I hope this saves a lot of pain and that I don't regret it because she is an amazing girl whereas I have not always done right by her. 

I also talked to my family too about this, so y'all weren't my only confidantes. I appreciate the perspectives and personal stories."
After three years of searching I finally found her. My soulmate.,"Three years after my divorce I have finally found the woman of my dreams. My soulmate. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/BgUdtbS

I tried every dating app out there and went on countless failed and awkward dates. Just as I was about to give up and call it quits I matched with this amazing woman. 

After chatting for a few days I could tell there was something there. Chatting led to lengthy phone conversations that cemented in my mind that everything about this is right. When we finally went on our first date we already knew we were meant to be together. Now we begin planning the rest of our lives together. 

Don’t give up hope. Exercise patience and wait for the right one. I had sworn off dating apps for a period of time. I just had terrible luck with them. Dead end conversations and terrible dates that began out of desperation. I decided to give it one more shot. Months of nothing but a couple dates that were not going anywhere. I was about to delete my accounts again but somehow convinced myself to have a little more patience. So glad I did."
Taking Time Out: Thoughts and lessons after a year off from dating,"Hey peeps. So as the title prefaces, after trying out online dating late 2017 for the first time and calling it a day after just two months I [23M] decided that I didn’t like myself, my life and my personal relationships. It was then I decided that I would take a year out from the weird world of dating to get myself to a place that I would be happily single. 

Taking this decision wasn’t easy. A friend just a little bit older than me got engaged at a similar time. It’s too easy to descend into the old enemy, the sunk cost fallacy. “If I just keep trying, someone somewhere will want to be with me”. Sound familiar? It’s something I was thinking near constantly nearing the point of making the decision to have a break. It was becoming an obsession. In the morning I was swiping, messaging and researching so I could become the “ultimate catch”, at night I was upset that it wasn’t happening. In truth, I was losing myself. The ghosting, the chats that never went anywhere, all of the very real issues with dating were damaging my mental health. In reality, I wasn’t mentally ready. My relationships with friends were breaking down, my work was restructuring and in truth, I was lonely.  So lesson 1: don’t lose yourself to a relationship you don’t have yet. Know when to stop. It can be 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, however long since you started. If it’s making you question your worth, stop. You’re worth more than that.

I’m not going to lie, the first few months were difficult. There was so much I wanted to do but nothing was happening. I went to get therapy for issues I’ve had since childhood but I was on a waiting list for a long while. I was trying to force change, just like I was trying to force attraction. I had to learn to just let it happen. Work hard when you need to, but don’t try too hard at the cost of your mental health. I should point out at this point that nothing I’ve done have improved my dating skills. They’ve just helped me become a better version of myself, and get the support network and the skills to look after myself better. This makes me feel better about myself and makes it easier for me to put an honest version of myself out there without fear. I got new hobbies, things that my childhood self would think I was amazing for doing. Your past version is the only person you need to compare yourself to. The best thing is that I gained new friends doing these things. Surrounding yourself with great people gives you a crashmat for potential heartbreak. Cultivate your existing and new relationships. That’s another lesson. 

I also made sure I hit the gym. It’s a cliche, I know. It just works though. You feel better about your body and the endorphins boost your mood. If you’re like me and compare yourself to other people, going to a public gym kick you out of that habit. You get used to people. They’re doing their thing and you should do yours.

I don’t have any fairytale endings like “And now I’m in a relationship!!!” because that was never the goal. I had a date last week that didn’t as well as I’d hoped. I’m still a bit sad about that. The goal though was to build a life I’m proud of. And I am. My career has never been better. I have hobbies that I love and get me around great people. I’ve consistently hit the gym which has improved my mood and body confidence. I’ve got therapy which has helped me accept myself for who I am. Dating is tough, make no mistake. There will be times when you go to sleep sad, you wake up sad and nothing seems to get anywhere you want. That’s the truth. But that’s just some of the truth. You want a relationship because you have love to give. To give love you must have love. To have love you need pride in who you are and what you are all about. Then, it’s just a case of time.

It’s a bit of a ramble, but I hope it shows that when someone says for you to take a break from dating, it’s not wasted time. In fact, I found it to be the most fulfilling time I’ve had in years.

TLDR: Don’t lose your soul to the online dating gods. Take time out if you need it. It may be the best thing you do.

Edit! Thanks for all your wonderful comments and sharing your own experiences. It’s been a treasure for me to read through them and reply today. Look after your brothers and sisters peeps. 

One more thing, u/kevin_r13 has left another and, in my opinion, completely doable alternative for those who want to keep dating and improving. I personally will find it a bit trickier but I feel it’s a good step to take to see where your limit is. Take a look below the post for his comment."
My super handsome friend is often rejected because of his origins,"One of my friends is originally from Syria (he was born and grew up there, but he left Syria when he was 15). He then lived in Switzerland and moved to the Uk for University. He left Syria with his family long before the war, and so he has nothing to do with it. I have known him since he moved to the UK. He is very handsome and attractive (he looks exactly like Maluma). He has been facing a lot of problems just because of his origins. Since he is attractive and doesn’t have a typical Middle Eastern appearance, people in general and girls in particular approach him a lot in parties and clubs thinking he is Spanish, Italian, or Brazilian. However as soon as he tells them about his origins, they just leave him and their interest in him fades away. He had a lot of problems with dating. Girls would go out with him once and then when they learn about his origins, they would stop talking to him. Same story happens on Tinder. When we go out and socialise with people, sometimes things get worse. Some people would ask him where is he from and as soon as he mentions Syria, people would start asking him questions about the war, when is he going back, and how did he arrive to the UK. Some people were even rude to him and said things like “are you a refugee”, “did you come here on a boat”, and “why didn’t you stay”. Some people and particularly girls said racists things to him like “I don’t do Arabs”, “you’re too hot to be Arab”, “sorry I thought you were Italian when I gave you my number”, and “oh how come? You don’t look like those poor refugees”. He recently decided to not go out anymore, and he is isolating himself and avoiding all social encounters. Recently, I managed to convince him to go out with us few times but I noticed that he was avoiding to introduce himself to new people. If we meet new people in the bar or the club, he would step back and pretend to be on his phone or go to the bathroom. He doesn’t want to face the question of “where are you from”. He is smart, well-educated, goes to one of the best schools in the UK, and speaks English fluently in addition to three other languages. What do you people think? And does anyone has ever been in this situation? And what do you think he should do?"
No is awesome!,"Long-ish post :)

I matched a guy and we texted a little. He preferred talking on the phone, and I don't. But then, I agreed only because I was low on battery and knew this call won't last long (win!). Later that night, we spoke till the morning. Giggling and connecting like we had been best friends for years. We decided to meet the same day, and it was great. We spoke constantly for the next few days. He formally asked me out again, and told me he'd really like to take me out on another date. He used the word ""date"" which is a dying word nowadays. I was excited and when we went to the beach at night. We walked and talked, and there came a moment when I asked him about his family. He spoke about it openly, but shut down right after. When he was dropping me home, he warned he may shut down because of that conversation, and I said it's okay. Take your time & call me whenever. He flirted with me, held hands through the date. I walked away feeling a deeper connection with him at this point, BUT hr called the next day, and literally went from hi to ""I'm sorry I'm not ready for a relationship. I really like you and am attracted to you, so would you like to be friends with benefits or we could just be friends too"". After taking in what he said, I said a firm ""No. I'm not looking for fwbs"" and hung up. I was confused for a while, so I called him again the next day, and you could tell he's being awkward now. I didn't care now. I had called to tell him, I didn't even want to be friends with him.  He was shocked about this, even sounded a little hurt. He tried convincing me otherwise, but I wished him luck and hung up.

The whole thing was very confusing, but the feeling to throw away something before it rots made me feel so good and powerful. It was like cleaning up your room, and creating space after having thrown all things unnecessary. It's sad how much time we spend hanging onto people in hope and expectations. Not having done that for once, liberated me. Made me feel more confident, in charge and actually more hopeful that I could find the right guy."
Just A Word to the Wise (And the Fools too),"I see a lot of posts regarding whether or not someone is showing real interest in the poster. 

It's pretty simple: there's no such thing as someone being ""too busy"" for something that they genuinely want. People will make time in their schedule for you if they're really interested in meeting you and getting to know you. If all you get is excuses when it comes time to meet up, then newsflash: they're not that interested in you. For the sake of hope and not giving up we give benefits of doubt and make the excuses valid so as not to feel hurt or bad about that fact that the person we're interested in isn't interested in the same way, but that's what it is.

If they're really that busy at a specific point in time where you don't get to meet up, then they'll offer a rescheduled date when they know they'll be free because again, people will pursue the things they really want, so if someone really wants you, they'll find a way to make it happen.  "
No communication after setting date?,"I’m super new to the dating scene after about 15 years so sorry if I sound like such a newbie. 

I’ve been doing a few apps and have been talking to some great guys so far. One particularly nice one has set up a date with me for this Sunday over a week ago. Since setting up the date though he hasn’t messaged at all. Is this common? I’ll still be going to the date but I felt like I’ve lost a little interest in him since we haven’t talked and now other guys seem more interesting."
Advice for everyone,"Been reading a lot of these posts lately and something I've noticed is that everyone is making things more complicated than it actually is. Dating is very simple when you look at it the right way. Don't over read actions and words because everyone is different in what those words and actions mean. What you need to observe is the over all feeling of someone. If you get a ""hint"" that someone doesn't like you back, they don't. If someone is ""acting"" clingy, they are. Simple as that. Save for a few specific senarios most people are extremely straightforward about what they want and don't beat around the bush."
You ever get so jaded with dating that you tell yourself the only requirements in a partner are that they’re attractive and make you feel good?,"Cuz that’s where I’m at. 

“I ain’t got no type, attractive girls giving me attention the only thing that I like.” "
Have you ever dated a Kronk?,"There's a certain type of guy I [29F] have run into multiple times.  Oh, yeah, He has the enthusiasm; he has the strong build; he will take the initiative,  but darn, if he doesn't remind you of Kronk from Emperor's New Groove.

This one guy I met in person (but hadn't spoken much with then) just is not a quick-witted man, and I love quick-wittedness in a guy. I hadn't really texted with him much until yesterday, and my lord, like walking through mud.  I'm more of a goofy person/texter and love the same.  I came up with a plan of something to do that was more light-hearted and would give us a chance to talk. Planless before,  he all of a sudden wanted to go somewhere else to a loud club.

As of now, I'm pretty sure he thinks I'm going with him to this club this weekend although I did not agree and no plans were specified. I'll be at a dance class instead. 

What is up with these dudes though? Lack of social skills? This guy is in a career that requires a high level of intelligence, so he has to have some level of smartness. All I know is that I feel exhausted after just one day of talking to this recent dude, and I'm going to do a catch and release here. 

EDIT: All right, so a summary here. I grew up homeschooled in an abusive home with no access to the outside world (censored). I can see how it looks like I'm ragging on the dude,  but as I often tell my counselor, I feel like I didn't see many different models of human behavior.  When I see something I don't understand, I want to know *why?*

Thank all of you for your responses.  It helped me better understand some things. 


1) I was kind of emotionally exhausted after texting him and couldn't figure out why. Realized it was because he was marching all over my suggested plans (after he did not suggest any plans) and was demanding only his way. At first, I thought he was just awkward but then he got kind of obtuse.


2) He texted me some other things that made me feel like he was nervous and covering for his nerves by being really macho and controlling.


3) A surprising number of you are really fixated on the fact that he probably has sex despite his lack of social skills....which is kind of odd to bring up; is incels leaking?



Anyway, thank you for those who did provide constructive feedback."
People should stop using “stoicism” as an excuse for emotional unavailability.,"This grinds my reels so much. “My daddy didn’t hug me enough so imma have trouble emoting like a normal human being.. here look at me make a straight face while you try to humor me, I’m just a stoic” NO. You’re emotionally stunted that’s it’s. stoicism is rational emotional response ; not lack of emotional response. 

Jesus! Lot of us grew up in broken homes, heck some of us were thrashed growing up. We didn’t turn out to be complete jackasses who cannot appreciate other humans being nice, neither did we take up after the gross misdemeanour of our parents. 

“Stoicism” to men in their mid-20s is what emo is to teenagers. Im so so done."
Anyone else getting depressed from dating apps?,I feel burnt out and i havent even gotten one date in 5 months. I initially went on to distract myself from my breakup but i find the convos going nowhere no dates just guys wanting to smash is getting depressing. Anyone else wanting to take a break?
Man I just want a boyfriend. 😂,IT’S ALMOST HYPOTHERMIA SEASON and I just want a mans to be cute with ya know 😭 oh the struggle
In person I asked a girl I like out for lunch. Rejected. Bummer.,She was a little out of my league. But I tried and I thought I did a good job. I was smooth about it. It came naturally from the conversation. Just sucks.
I was already #done with dating and today I was pushed over the edge,"I was chatting with some guy on Bumble, he asked me to meet up with him and when I was hesitant (and mentioned it was because he had no clear photos of his face) he just said: 

“I’m way too good looking for you”


And for some reason it like really negatively affected me. Also does it not take two minutes to take a decent selfie? I’ve been on dates with people with unclear photos and been disappointed in the past. 

I also can feel a bit insecure about my looks... I’m 30 now and I know I don’t look like a 20 year old anymore. I don’t put a ton of makeup on and so my photos are more natural looking. I don’t think I’m ugly but sometimes I feel like my face isn’t feminine enough or something. I also recently dated someone who would put me down and comment on how attractive other women were and I’m still recovering from that. This comment just brought all of that back and I hate that it did but I’m deleting this and all dating apps. I can be a sensitive person (it’s just who I am, it has its pros and its cons) and I feel I can’t put myself out there right now if I can’t deal with the potential for random acts of cruelty.

Anyway just wanted to vent. It was disappointing and hurtful and I don’t understand why people are this way.

Edit: thank you for the support/kind words!"
I had my first kiss last night,"I’m 16f, and have been asked out a handful of times I guess but I haven’t really been interested in anyone. I reconnected with a boy I was friends with and we went out to the movies, and last night went to a park. Had a good makeout sesh in his car :) I’m buzzing now thinking about it and we’re going out today for lunch. So excited for the future!"
Did this guy sexual assault or?,"So I'm 20 and met this 26 yr old at the club on Sat.  Knew something was weird when he legit waited for me while I was taking pics with my friends. Gave him my alternative number and texted him a bit. Seemed cool. Wanted to hang out and talk so I agreed on Tuesday evening at the mall. We did and the convo went okay. I already noticed red flags like how he mentioned he would put a recorder under his bed to see if the ex was cheating as well as well as wait at her work to see also. He then asked if I was talking to anyone else. Told him I was just meeting people bc I was tired of the consistent hurt. He then said he would keep me and how he feels a connection (red flag).

So we went back to this car..and he wanted to kiss. I told him no, that I barely know him and how I don't kiss on the first date. He kept asking like four times...and asked what book I was reading that said I had to not kiss on the first meet (red flag). I told him how I'm not easy. He was like, wow you're putting a wall. Like wtf? He then asked me to hold my hand...at this point, I was getting scared so I just did it. Next thing you know, he puts his hand on my thighs and starts rubbing them. I then held his hand because he was making his way to my private and going inside my dress..and I told him to stop. He didn't. Next thing you know, this guys bends over to where I was, pulls my dress back, and puts his head between my legs & starts licking my thighs/heading to my private. I was so scared and taken back. Tried to push him off of me....he wouldn't move despite me telling me to stop plus he was like 2x bigger than me. Luckily, he didn't get to my private as I was trying my best to hold my underwear so he wouldn't see it. He was like, ""let me lick it baby. Relax. Relax. Enjoy it"" I then started almost crying and he finally got up. Asked him what was that..and next thing you know, he exposed my boob and took out his private. Told me to touch it. Again, I couldn't move so I did...and felt so low. It wasn't until I pretended to get my pepper spray and then he pushed back. I was able to leave and the car. And I just sped off. He called three times after... I blocked his number. I unblocked today, thinking he would apologize and all he said was ""couldn't stop thinking about you""

I just regret going into the car with him because he didn't portray that character in the beginning."
Know when to fight and when to move on.,"This is a reminder to anyone who might be dating right now, including me (like a note to self). 

Before you start getting serious with anyone or even when you’re already in a relationship with someone, make a list of your negotiables and non-negotiables.

Negotiables - Things you would prefer to have in a partner but you can do without. Traits that you can compromise on without feeling too bad about it. Example: tall, older/younger, master’s degree (this is all up to you, these are just samples)

Non-Negotiables- The important bit. Traits in your partner that if they didn’t have it, would drive you absolutely crazy. Lack of any of these traits will endanger your relationship. There is no way you can compromise on these aspects of the relationship. Example: loves dogs, loves children, vegan (again, these are just samples and will totally depend on your taste)

Do you have the lists done? Good. Now review that list. Make sure you have everything right. Make sure that what you listed are things you are absolutely sure of.

Are you sure now? Good. Now date.

Every time something pops up that unsettles you, go back to your list. Is it negotiable? Non-negotiable?

If it’s negotiable, learn to give in. If it’s something you can put up with or something you can do without, try to compromise. Don’t end a relationship over something you don’t mind letting go. 

Don’t argue for the sake of arguing and don’t let your pride take over. You could be giving up something good for something so small.

If it’s non-negotiable, stand your ground. Remember, this was non-negotiable for a reason. You said you needed this because you couldn’t bear to be in a relationship without it. Sometimes, when we fall in love, we keep giving even at the expense of our own well-being and peace of mind. Don’t do it. Learn to say no when it’s on things that mean much to you. 

I’ve seen so many people give everything to someone who couldn’t care less. I have seen people do things they normally wouldn’t do all in the name of “love.” I wasted three years on a guy who promised me the world but couldn’t follow through with even our dates. Don’t be like us. Know your worth and know that you can always walk away.

"(20F) guy is kind of out of my league but he’s so handsome, should I shoot my shot anyway?","I’m not super unattractive, tbh I would say the only thing in my opinion that makes me unattractive is my weight, I’m tall so my weight proportions good so I don’t look really big I’m just average. anyway I kind of talked to him on accident and he’s really chill and seems really sweet, I noticed him immediately when I first saw and he’s super handsome but not someone I feel would give me the time of day because normally that’s what people think when someone is more attractive than them. should I shoot my shot anyway?"
"Walked out on my dinner date, could I have handled it better?","I (22M) had matched with a girl (19F) and we agreed to meet up for some sushi the following night. She seemed friendly over text, and we had no real issue talking about our interests and hobbies. But I’m not the kind of person that likes to text too much before meeting up because I prefer talking to someone in person. 

This is for a few reasons:

1. To see what they sound like and if their tone matches the way they text. A lot of people are great at texting, but when it comes to in person socializing, they can turn into a wall.

2. I can see what they’re body language is like. Even if they sound interested, their body will often show if they actually are or not through things like posture and contact.

3. Finally, to see how they treat others in a public space or forum such as restaurant wait staff. I believe how someone acts towards another that can give them nothing in return shows the type of person that they are.

I could very well be over analyzing, but this is the first time where as time went on, there were more and more red flags/instances that eventually led to me walking out.

Initially, we agreed to meet at the restaurant at 6:30 pm. I text her earlier after I finished work around 3 pm letting her know that I’m looking forward to dinner. I don’t get a text back, which is fine because I saw that she read it. She also told me the night before that she’s free after her last class ends at noon. 

[PROBLEM #1]
I get to the restaurant at 6:25 pm and get us a table inside. Ten minutes pass and at 6:35 pm, I get a text asking if I’m there yet, I reply saying I’m already inside. She then responds saying she got distracting with her dog and that she’ll be there in ten to fifteen minutes. 

Now, I usually don’t mind if someone is running late as long as they have a good reason and let me know in a timely manner. But she did neither of these things. If I agree to meet somebody at a certain time, I’m going to get there early no matter what to account for traffic, parking and searching for the place. Not only does she text me after our meeting time, she said she’ll arrive even later than that. This signals to me that she doesn’t respect other people’s time, especially with a reason like getting distracted by your dog.


[PROBLEM #2]
Once she arrives, we greet each other and I ask her how her day was, and what she did. She said she had classes up until noon, then met up with her friends after for lunch and spent the rest of the day playing with her dog. As she’s taking a look at the menu, she tells me that the reason she loves sushi so much is because her Ex was a sushi chef. 

Now I usually don’t mind when people bring up past relationships on a first date, but this kinda bothered me a lot because we hadn’t really built up much rapport other than talking about what we did in the day. And on top of that, she continued to talk about how he got her into other things like piano, and all the times he would cook for her while they were together. Maybe it’s just me, but I’m sure talking about your Ex this much isn’t something any rational person would do at the beginning of meeting someone for the first time. It occurred to me that the way she was describing him meant the break up was fairly recent.


[PROBLEM #3]
After we get our food, she has trouble using her chopsticks so I tease her about it in a lighthearted manner saying that maybe we should ask for a fork. She does something unexpected and actually decides to start criticizing the sushi chef for not rolling the sushi correctly. I was completely perplexed because our sushi rolls looked exactly the same, barring what was inside, but I had no trouble eating mine. And AGAIN, she brought up how if her Ex had made her sushi, it wouldn’t have turned out this bad. 

I was actually left speechless for a few seconds because the way she said it, it didn’t come off as a joke at all. She was being completely serious and was actually insulting the sushi chef, mind you for something that wasn’t even his fault. Her sushi had been falling apart because of her lack of basic ability to use chopsticks. 


[PROBLEM #4]
And lastly, as the waiter came back to fill up our waters, she had the audacity to say that he had an ugly and unappealing hairstyle. Now I wouldn’t say that his hair was particularly well kempt in my opinion, but I would never say that out loud in a restaurant. For me, that was three strikes and you’re out. 

I had asked the waiter for the check before either of us even got to finishing half of our meal and he brought it within a few minutes. She spent that time not making eye contact, just simply looking at her plate while I stared at her. Once the check came, I give the waiter my card quickly so he could return it. Then she decides to mention out of the blue that her Ex cheated on her. And as much as I hate people who lie and cheat, that doesn’t give her the right to act the way she did in that restaurant, nor does it excuse her behavior. 

I told her after, that maybe she shouldn’t be out dating, wasting other people’s time and insulting strangers who’ve done nothing to her simply because she got cheated on. I picked up my card, signed the check and walked out after that. Unmatched her, blocked and deleted her number because the price of that meal and walking out was better than sticking around for round 2 to uncover what other problems she would want to put on others. 

I think I gave her plenty of chances, and was more than tolerant throughout the night. But perhaps I could’ve handled it differently, thoughts? 


TLDR: I went on a dinner date with a girl that ended in me walking out before we finished our meal. She talked about her Ex majority of the time, talked bad about the wait staff and chef, and tried to make excuses for her behavior. Could I have handled it better/differently?"
"You give up hope and try to learn how to live by yourself they say you’re crazy and no human can live alone. You get out of your bubble and start talking to girls, they’ll call you desperate and you don’t need a girl to be happy.","Long story short I’m being driven mad, last year I spent it alone by myself taking Meds that lower libido and people said I’m killing myself this way. This year I’m out of my bubble and people are saying I’m being rash and desperate and that I don’t need a girl to be happy. 

Like wtf am I supposed to do?!!"
Come on guys,"I’m a female (24) and I am so tired of trying to carry a conversation. Things were going good on the app itself (bumble) but then we moved our talking over to Snapchat and just like that I get nothing but a picture of his face with no fucking text or questions asked. So I send the same shit back and I get left on read. Yeah no, do these dudes just expect you to stick around and hope they’ll get better at communicating? I just straight told him I’m going to pass because the lack of conversation is unappealing and it’s just so one sided. Here’s a tip when talking to a girl fucking ask her some questions! Get to know her! If I ask you a question why not just respond with the answer and a simple hbu? I just don’t get it. If your bumble says you’re after a relationship don’t you think you would try?? Ugh I’m just glad I’m getting better at calling these guys out and just moving on."
How are some people always able to bounce from relationship and never be single?,"I’m fed up of always being alone. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe I sound conceited for saying this but I don’t think I’m ugly and am jealous of those women I’ve known that always have men flock to them and I’m alone/invisible. I’m told I’m attractive and have lost all this weight to STILL END UP UNNOTICED. I don’t have any close friends and use dating apps because that’s the only connection I can make with the lack of people I know. I get messages but generally from guys I don’t want to pursue. And if the guy I do like messages me, THEY TYPICALLY STOP MESSAGING ME. I settled with the last guy I saw and refuse to make an exception for my standards oncemore. I’m fat and I’m alone. I’m skinnier and I’m alone. Short hair or long hair and still alone. What will it take to attract a guy that I like?"
i’m so extremely and utterly happy in my relationship.,"my names Elizabeth, i’m 23. i have been in some really bad relationships and some really bad situations. but currently i’m with someone who makes me feel like all the pain and hurt i’ve gone through was so worth it because i have him. he’s so sweet and he doesn’t use my trauma against me and he loves me and guyyysssss. i’m just so so happy. sorry for the rant. i just, my heart is racing and i just need to vent about this guy. he’s just perfect."
"Girls, do you ever change your mind after you rejected a guy?","I’m wondering if there is a possibility of asking a girl out a second time. I usually follow the rules of, if she said no then move on, but sometimes I wonder if asking the second time is right."
Sometimes there are days when it sucks to be alone.,"I am alright with being alone, but sometimes there are days that I wish I would be with someone. Those days I feel like I wish I could find someone so that we could go on a walk with a dog on weekends. I wish I could find someone to go on a ice cream day on a weekend. I wish I could find someone to binge watch Netflix cuddling in the couch. I wish and I wish. 

It just sucks those days being alone. Thought of not meeting someone makes me miserable sometimes.

If anyone is in this same scope, how do you cope with this?"
First date tomorrow!,"Lurker coming out of the shadows here! So I met a guy through an app last week and after a few days of chatting, he asked if we could meet up.

This world is so small, we actually have a mutual friend in common. Similar hobbies, similar lifestyles.

I'm liking where this is going, honestly. But if I'm honest, I'm in my late 20s and this is my first date ever.

I'm perfectly prepared to be myself. I'm really excited to get to know each other more. No crazy fantasies or expectations in my head (learned my lesson with that.)

Idk, I've just got pre-first-date jitters lol

**UPDATE:** Thank you, everyone, for your support and kind words! Date was GREAT — we learned a lot about each other.

Second date in the works :)"
"A darker topic, but I really need help.","My girlfriend committed suicide a few days ago, or attempted it and passed away later that day. I was in an LDR with her for about 2 months but she disappeared for the last couple of days. At that point I called her obssessively and was really worried if anything happened to her. She talked to me in the past about the feeling of death and that she wasn’t afraid of it, and she’s been abused by her aunt for 6 years. I called her until her mum picked up and told me what happened.

She came over to where I lived the first time 1 month ago and we had an amazing time together. She left her pyjamas here to remind me of her. She enjoys playing video games and likes hello kitty. I kissed her for the first time and it was the happiest day of my life. I love her so much, I’m still in denial of her being gone forever. I can still remember her smell, her smiling face, her laugh, and her cry when she had to leave. I remember that she loved to eat chicken wings and she can speak 3 different languages.

I am stuck. I can’t afford to go and see her family, I’m only a student. We had a beautiful plan for the future together and now she’s gone forever. Help. What do I do?"
Is it not normal/detrimental that I never 'chase' women?,"Hello,

I have some experience online and IRL dating. I strongly prefer IRL. During both, I totally prescribe to the principle that I will never ""chase"" a girl. I will never spend 1 second convincing anybody that spending time with me is a good idea. 

Because I am a male dating in the US, I understand that it is mostly our 'job' to make the first move. However, after I have made my intentions clear, I do not ever follow up if I do not get a response.

This has undoubtedly lowered my dating pool, but every relationship ive been in has been extremely meaningful because I know that she was 100% about it as much as I was. 

For instance:
If a girl dosnt reply back to my text, I'll probably never text her ever again until she gets back to me (unless the text I sent her didnt leave any room for a response or something).

Here is an example: I met a girl in real life. We hit it off. We met at a show and had a great time. We met another time at a show and had a great time. 

After some back and forth texting I asked if she was available to maybe have some lunch that week. No reply. 

A week later she messaged me asking me where I went. I told her that because I didnt get a reply from her, I wasnt really interested in continuing. She told me exactly this ""I'm so sorry! I was busy with XYZ, I don't want you to think I dont like you""
I said ""awesome because I like you to and I'm glad you reached out. What are you doing this weekend, I'd love to take you out on a date friday night if you are available""

Again, no response. 

Maybe she didnt like me as much as I thought. Maybe she didnt like the word 'date', maybe something terrible happened, maybe she dropped her phone. 

The entire point of this thread, reddit, is this:

I subscribe to the ""Fuck Yes' or ""Fuck No"" mentality when dating. Every single step of the way, if she is not right there with me, then I lose interest.


Should I be double-texting girls? Should I be following up to see if they get my message? Should I ever express interest more than once? Am I doing this 'wrong'?
"
My[26F] life is going great but I’m lonely and I don’t feel like I’ll ever find that person,"Hey guys. I’m just generally frustrated and I’m coming here to vent.

I haven’t dated someone since July of last year. It’s been a whole year. And it’s not because guys haven’t approached me, it’s because I haven’t found anyone even remotely interesting. And when I do, they don’t seem interested back.

I’m 26, I started a business last year and it’s just now starting to pick up. I’m doing better financially, living in my own apartment, confident in my looks (obviously to an extent because we all have our days), have great friends and family. I’m generally very happy. The only thing that upsets me is feeling really lonely most of the time.

Loneliness is taboo to talk about but we all experience it. I’ve tried online dating and it’s a disaster. The guys on there are mostly looking for random hook ups and I’m not. I’m dating for the long term.

The guys who do want to go out with me seem to be endlessly boring. A lot of them lack ambition, the ability to plan a decent date or basic conversational skills. When I do find a guy who has what I’d like in a partner (ambition, intelligence, kindness, etc), they don’t seem interested in ever meeting me in person.

I refuse to settle, but after a year without so much as dating someone for longer than 3 dates, I start to feel like I’ll never find my person. I won’t date anyone unless they add to my already full life and at the moment no one is making the cut. And it makes me sad sometimes."
What is with all the dog comments on tinder/bumble etc,"NO. YOU ARE NOT GONNA LOVE MY DOG MORE THAN I DO.


NO. MY DOG IS NOT GOING TO LOVE YOU MORE THAN HE LOVES ME

These aren't even clever lines and they are literally on every 3rd profile I see.

Wtf wtf wtf?

Just no."
"“If you try to build intimacy with another person before you have gotten whole on your own, all your relationships become an attempt to complete yourself.” – Dr. Les Parrott","34M going on one year divorced from my wife of 13 years. I still miss her, but hindsight has enabled me to see that our marriage was super codependent and sometimes flat out toxic, because we both weren’t “whole” without the other. We got married when she was 16 and neither of us knew anything about who we were as individuals, we were just IN LOVE^TM and figured that was all that we needed to succeed. Untreated mental health issues, infidelity that we tried to forget about instead of getting counseling for, self harm, threatening suicide, control issues, childhood physical/emotional/sexual abuse.... we both should have, not just “worked on” our issues, but sought treatment and HELP for our issues, before we ever entered the world of dating. Please, learn from my mistakes, don’t get married or have a relationship with someone because you feel like they can “complete” you. It’s one thing to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, sure, but at the end of the day you still need to be “complete” as a person regardless of who is in your life (or not). I’m on the journey towards that now; got me a therapist, got on some medications, got Jesus. Quit smoking, quit drinking, quit watching porn, quit playing video games. Finally finished my degree, made a plan for the next one. Started working out, stopped dressing like I live in a van near the airport; started going to church again for the first time in 20 years, stopped cussing like a sailor with Tourette’s; started playing with my kids more, stopped letting the TV babysit them.     
I’m not planning on letting up anytime soon, but for the first time in my life I feel like I sort of know who I am. And it’s a nice feeling.    
May you each be blessed with your own wholeness as well."
How can you say you like someone if you only hang out once a week,"I’ve been seeing this guy for almost 4 months. And he is super fun but he is horrible at texting. Literally maybe once every second day. 

Anyway last weekend he told me he liked me. But I think he only said it because he was drunk? 

I’m just entirely confused. How can you like someone if you only see them once a week and text them twice? 

How can someone be so busy to not text more. I see it as though, if he doesn’t text he isn’t interested. Talking to someone should be exciting and not a chore. 

Should I let him go?

I’ve talked to him about it and I said he shouldn’t change for anyone and if I don’t like it it doesn’t mean he should change. 

I’m just so confused."
Caring is COOL,"I hate the mentality that whoever cares less it the winner in the relationship. What a shit attitude. I want to be with someone who cares just as much as I do about everything. It feels good to care about things. 

It's not cool to make someone feel like shit because you're acting like/actually don't care."
How do I get over this fear and thought?,"That I may never get laid. I don't know if anyone finds me attractive. I try dressing up in the best way possible, get that expensive haircut, spray some Cologne, try to smile at people i know. 
I can't flirt or ask a girl out because I fear rejection and being branded a creep by them. I am desperate nowadays and I know sex won't change my life but I want feel love and attraction from someone of the opposite sex.."
CREEPY...a simple breakdown,"One too many posts as of late are from some that are blatantly ignoring social cues, body language, and boundaries! It is like on 'repeat' in this subreddit all of a sudden. So, in order to clarify, here is a breakdown for folks to understand (from a womans viewpoint)


creepy

 adjective

\ˈkrē-pē  \

creepier; creepiest

Definition of creepy 

1: producing a nervous shivery apprehensiona creepy horror storyalso : EERIE

2: of, relating to, or being a creep : annoyingly unpleasanta creepy old man


Nobody cares how much YOU like someone - let's just put that out there. If that person doesnt reciprocate, then let it go...please!


...If someone blocks you on IG, dont reach out through fb or Twitter ""just to explain"" yourself. Do not chase them, dont try harder, dont convince yourself that if you keep asking, they may say yes the 25th time. 


...Dont go home and become obsessed with them and read into every single move they make, mistaking it as 'interest' - then negatively citiquing that persons choices in dating (just because he/she didnt select you). 


...Dont not send gifts or get friends involved in trying to convince this person to change their mind. 


...If you approach someone and they turn their back to you, play with their phone, or blatantly ignore you - walk away. Do not linger there and continue trying to have a discussion. 


...And lastly, do not take on the negative attitude that you are owed a chance by that person all because YOU have convinced yourself your feelings are deep and you have unnecessarily invested so much time in someone that doesnt care for you...


Self awareness is VERY important!!! It is the difference in understanding that your behavior has gone too far and that your feelings may not be reciprocated... vs...avoiding a harassment charge because you didnt stop hitting on someone who made themselves clear. "
It feels kind of strange looking good with someone in a photo,"The guy I’ve been dating suggested on a recent date that we should get a photo together.

Holy shit it’s a nice photo. I’m surprised how good we look together. I don’t think I ever looked that fitting with my exes. I keep looking at the photo and am just amazed how well it looks like we fit together. 

I don’t know what that means but I wanted to share. "
Sometimes I can't believe what a small world it is...,"So a week or two ago I matched up with a girl on Bumble and we started talking. She seemed really sweet and she's really pretty, so I decided to ask her out.

We met up today and realized we live in the same town. Then we realized she takes her pets to the animal hospital I work at part-time (used to be full-time until I switched to human medicine). Then we realized we live just a few houses away from eachother and were laughing about it for the rest of the date. We've both lived just a few houses away from eachother for our entire lives and never got to meet until today! She went to private school and I went to public school, so that's why haha. Luckily she was pretty awesome and we're both REALLY excited for our next date, otherwise it would've been ultra awkward. We were laughing about how bad it would've been if we both drove home from the coffee shop where we met up and thought we were following eachother home.

I'm so happy! I know it was just a first date and it may not mean much, but I don't think I've ever clicked so well with someone on a first date and that revelation just added so much to it! And it's hilarious to think about the fact that I've been at her doorstep when trick-or-treating, have waved to her parents sometimes when driving past her house, and have spoken to her grandmother in the past. I can't believe I had never seen her!

Well, that's my story haha. It doesn't contribute much, but it put a big smile on my face today and I thought I'd share. :) I hope a lot of my fellow r/dating redditors had something good happen to them today!"
Corona Virus made us rush this. Best decision ever made.,"My partner (25M) and myself (23M) have only been together 5 months next week.. I moved in with him at the start of our countries lock down, I only meant to stay while I was furloughed from my old job. On a whim I applied for a job closer to his house. I got it. I didn't expect to. But I did. I gave up my flat, my old job and my old town. We decided to try and see if it works. If it didn't work now, why would it work a year later? 

I've been living here two months now. There's still the odd thing to unpack but this house feels more like home than any of my old flats that I've lived alone in. 

We're more in love now than ever, and I fall in love with him more and more everyday. We're planning our future in this house, kids, pets and DIY projects. We have the occasional spat but never anything serious. 


I made the right decision and I couldn't be happier."
I’m finally realizing my worth...,"I’ve always struggled with extremely low self esteem. In high school, my best friend was your stereotypical “it” girl: blonde hair, blue eyes, thin, confident, just “conventionally attractive”. Because of this, to me, it seemed like every single guy in our grade had a crush on her. It felt like every week she was telling me about a new guy confessing her attraction to her, and she had multiple boyfriends all 4 years.

I, on the other hand, was shy, awkward, and just overall your average “normal” high school kid. I never put myself out there out of insecurity and shyness. I always had crushes on guys, but none ever reciprocated. Because I never had any guy admit a crush on me, and instead of attributing this to me not putting myself out there, I told myself it was because I wasn’t good enough to be liked by anyone. I did end up getting into a long term relationship the summer after senior year of high school, however this relationship ended about a year ago in my junior year of college. After that relationship ended, I joined the online dating scene, and any time I started a new conversation with a guy, it felt like I needed to act perfectly: always answering, keeping the conversation alive even if it was dying and the other person seemed to lose interest, etc. Honestly, I disrespected myself multiple times forcing connections and conversations to “prove” to myself that I could make myself enough by continuing to interact with guys who obviously weren’t romantically interested and only kept me around for sex or sex related things, and I accepted that this was the best that I could get. 

Recently, this has finally started to feel wrong to me. I am currently talking to a guy who was enthusiastic about talking to me in the beginning (about three months ago) but in the past 3 weeks, has obviously lost interest and has tapered off contact to the point that he’s been leaving my Snapchat messages on delivered for up to 9 hours or more when he’s regularly active on the app. 

For some reason, this interaction has had helped me realize that I deserve more. Normally, I would feel happy that I was getting responses at all, feeling “lucky” that a guy would even respond to me after 9 hours. Not anymore. I’ve finally started to realize that there is someone out there who will be excited to talk to me for longer than just two months, who will put in the effort to see and respond to me, and will make me feel like I am enough. That person is out there, and it doesn’t matter if I go through a period of months or even years without talking to anyone romantically. I am finally realizing my worth, and that I would rather be alone than with someone who doesn’t respect me. I honestly think I need to be alone for a while, to further these “growth” thoughts to get to a point where I can be comfortable and secure with myself enough to be able to love someone while also loving myself. I am only 21, which I know is young, and I have my whole life ahead of me and am excited to see what comes next. 

I just wanted to share these sentiments with the hope that anyone going through anything remotely similar can read this and see that there is hope...a year ago, I never would have thought I could accept anything better for myself...but I’m growing, and learning, and if I can do it, you can too!"
Here’s an idea,"Instead of ghosting someone when you’re ready to move on just say something like:

“Hey, I hope this finds you well. I’ve enjoyed our conversations but I’m going to be moving on. I wish you the best in everything”

Done. Not really that hard is it?"
Who else feels like they are on “The Bachelor” whenever they are online dating?,I hate competition. I deleted the apps because I felt like I was a constant on the Bachelor 
If a girl tells you that you're cool and touches your shoulder a lot does that mean she likes you?,"A little background: So last college semester, I hung out a lot with this girl.  I had a crush on her when I saw her.  We were put into the same group in one of my classes.  Now I'm shy and I didn't initiate conversation.  One day, we were meeting as a group for a class project.  We had a library study room and there were four of us.  We worked for a while and the other two group members left.  When it was just me and the girl i like, she started a conversation with me.  We really started talking and the conversation just seemed natural.  Then one of the other group members came back and we didn't talk anymore.  As the semester progressed we hung out more.  One day we were in a study room together until 6:30.  So to my question, one time when we were sitting and talking she told me ""you're cool"".  It caught me off gaurd but I recovered and told her she was cool too.  Then as more time has gone on, she'd occasionally touch my shoulder and in one instance she briefly and very lightly grabbed my arm as she walked by me.  Are these signs that she likes me possibly? "
Is anyone else noticing that all of the dating apps are getting worse and worse?,"It seems that every app these days are just putting more and more features behind paywalls or outright removing them rather than adding more features. On top of this, I've noticed that some of them have started putting ads in with premium memberships making them way less desirable than they used to be."
Why does everyone want my snap?!,"I swear it’s so annoying, I’ll get like two messages then “add me on snap”. Like for one I’d like to get to know you more before adding you on snap. But also I don’t see why it has to be snap? I understand the idea of wanting to move out of tinder, but why can’t we just message somewhere else? I hate Snapchat, and people never have conversations on there anyway. God it’s so frustrating to get “hey” “how are you?” I’ll reply then “that’s cool add me on snap” one guy got mad that I didn’t want to add him!"
Dating in a Pandemic,"Honestly, I think dating in a pandemic puts a strain on almost every relationship. Whether you live together, are dating, married etc, everyone seems to be having some type of strain on their relationship. Mine, in particular, I have an issue trusting (due to trust issues in the past) but that's something I'm trying to slowly work on. 

How do you guys work through the insecurities in your relationship and how do you convey to your partner your issues? I tend to hold everything inside until it all bursts (also something I am trying to work on) - I just don't like feeling vulnerable and giving him that chance to hurt me. It's honestly quite terrifying. How do I learn to trust him more?"
"26M, just broke down crying because I've never had a girlfriend. I swear, being autistic is worse than having an STD","As the title says, and I'm a virgin (I've fooled around with 2 women but have never done penetrative sex). I'm getting fucking desperate.

Some asshole is probably going to tell me to ""man up"" or ""stop being a baby"", but hear me out. I work a minumum-wage job and have my own place. I'm also going to a university for a mechanical engineering degree. I am part of a running club, and automotive engineering club, and a comedy/improv club.

I work out, and am a half-marathoner. I am white, 6'2"", 200lbs, and have long, curly hair with a light beard. I have been told that I have ""no bad features"". I play guitar and bass in my free time, draw, record my own music, and love Star Wars and a lot of post-apocalyptic horror.

The number of different women I've dated + cuddled with + fooled around with is 31. Of those, 11 of them were willing to go on a second date. Of those, I took 6 of them up on their offer. With 2 of them, we couldn't agree on a relationship or FWBs. One led me on for three dates and broke my heart. With another two, either of us broke it off after the second date. However, I only met one of these 31 women at my school.

I am extremely shy, to the point where I broke down crying in the bathroom during a company party two months ago because I realized that I didn't have any friends there. I didn't make any friends throughout my entire high school life, but it's gotten better since then. However, all of my friends of both genders like me, and say that I'm fun and interesting to talk to. Not trying to be a ""nice guy"", just trying to mention that I don't have an atrocious personality.

My shyness is probably not going to improve very much. I've built up confidence, and a huge amount of social skills. but it has been extremely slow. Don't advise me to make any major changes quickly, it's just not going to happen.

* I ***LOATHE*** dating apps. They're boring, tedious, time-consuming, and brutally competitive. I also find that I meet much better people in real life than on apps.
* Although I prefer bigger/chubbier women, I'm not particularly picky about looks. I've liked and have dated short, tall, skinny, athletic, chubby, SSBBW, and everything in between.
* My views are close to the center and I actively avoid politics - so I don't hold any toxic/extreme views.
* I have a somewhat low libido, so it's not like I only care about sex. I would much prefer a genuine, wholesome relationship.

Two nights ago, I went to the hot tub with some of my buddies and drank a few beers. They were talking about women and sex, as if sex comes so easy for them and they don't even have to think about whether or not they ***can*** get a girlfriend or sex, where I can't even afford to be picky, and have to wait for the first woman to show interest in me.

It's so crazy. Like, one of the perverts on Chris Hansen's TCAP recently got married. So this overweight guy with a minimum-wage job who was literally jailed for attempting to groom and rape a little girl, eventually finds the love of his life. But I'm a mostly-functional human with 0 criminal history who has never even had one girlfriend."
"Anyone else get a case of the fuck-it’s, and just decide to have fun with it?","Just curious because I find that I have way more fun with the entire process when I treat it closer to a hobby rather than a job. 

Messages are crafted because I enjoy crafting them(obviously making sure they are not offensive), without any expectation of a response. Just crafting the message in an of itself is fun, especially when they have nearly empty profiles. 

A woman’s profile just said “sweet, loyal, and caring” and my message was “But can you tell me the flight speed of an unladen swallow”. Do I expect a response? NOPE, but I sure as hell had fun writing it. 

Go out, have fun! The best part is that it serves as a litmus test for people who will appreciate your type of humor.

Had alopecia since I was 13. It's where you're immune system rejects your hair so I've basically been bald since middle school. I'm otherwise healthy,  just no hair.

No guy has ever shown genuine interest me. Heck it's even hard to make decent friends because of it. I'm not attractive enough for people. I cry a lot because of it. Sometimes I think what's the point of living if I'm going to feel like this forever.

You’re doing great,"I’ve been reading a lot of posts and comments about being tired and fed up with the dating apps and dating culture. 

I’m sorry that people have been nasty. I’m sorry that people have treated you poorly. These people have probably been treated terribly as well and aren’t doing the work to forgive and grow. 

It’s rough out here, not just in dating, but in life in general. Try to protect your heart and sense of worth. If you’re feeling run down, take a break from swiping, do your best to treat yourself kindly. You are valuable and worthy of positive experiences. 

You’re doing great! There are gems out there, be the gem you’re looking for. "

What is the point of dating apps if people are just going to give you one word answers? Isn’t that AWKWARD?,"You wanna know why some people are single? Because at 31 years old - you’re giving one word answers on a dating app where conversation is like 75% of how these things work.

Feeling extremely depressed and confused after a breakup.. My [21F] girlfriend broke up with me [20M] I'm confused and still don't know what to do,"Hello everyone, well I don't even know where to start. I keep thinking about everything and what could possibly went wrong in our relationship but I just can't figure things out and it's honestly just killing me. It's driving me crazy.. I can't think about nothing else but this whole situation. 
I haven't been sleeping properly, I quitted my job cus I wasn't feeling any motivation at all. I haven't eaten properly in like 2-5 days, I been drinking this past 2 weeks like crazy and smoking till late in the night. Haven't eaten any food whatsoever. 

Well everything started a few weeks ago..  so she's in med school and she was having a rough and stressing week bc of tests and some important exams she had. And that's when she stared losing it. 

When we started dating I knew what I was signing up for. About her probably not replying to my texts or seeing each other for a few days bc of how busy she was from school. I was okay with that I was being supportive anf stuff bc this is her main goal in life.. I wasn't gonna interfere in that. All I wanted was the best for her. So I didn't asked for that much attention at least for me but I was all nuts for her. I was there everyday no matter what. So this is one of the reasons I'm so confused on what went wrong????

So during that specific week I messaged her ""good morning babe, have a nice day.. gl in your exams today. Yadaa yadaaa"" she didn't reply. 
I wasn't really bothered bc I knew she was busy and stressed. later that day I got on twitter and saw that she RT something so I liked it bc it was funny lmao. And a few minutes went by.. when she decided to text me back saying.. ""Oh I saw the notification and I felt so obligated to text you back"" 10min went by and she messages me again saying ""I can't do this anymore, this is way too much for me. When I was doing my exams today I couldn't focus bc I was thinking about you and that I needed to text you back yadaa yadaa"" 
That's when I started kinda freaking out cus she kept messaging me stuff like that. ""I don't even have time for myself and obviously I don't have time for you""
She was quick with that and said ""we'll talk about this later"" I was so confused that I didn't knew what to do atm.

4 days went by and that's when she decided to text me back and she already made up her decision about us breaking up. So she texted me this long paragraph, it was like in parts lol so I'm gonna do it like 1,2,3,4.

1. Hey, I had my last exam today so I'm done with that. I went out with my family and I had so much fun but I couldn't stop thinking about you and that I needed to give you an answer. I know I told you, you were the loml and I wanted to be with you. But I changed my mind and I no longer want that. 
2. I don't have enough time for me and I'm trying to have a ""normal life"" but I just can't bc of school so basically I don't even have time for you either. And I feel so bad bc I take forever to reply, we haven't seen in days and it must hurt you that the person you love the most takes forever to give you a lil of her time. Like I reply whenever I want or if I have time. And I feel so bad bc of that. 
3. Don't even try holding me back bc I know I'll start questioning myself about my decision and I'll ended up not breaking up with you but we'll be in the same situation. 
[Here's when I started getting a lil confused bc I felt like she wasn't a 100% sure about her decision]
4. I wanna have fun, go out, enjoy myself, develop and mature as a woman. 
[???????? What does this even mean????????] 

5. I don't think about you/us anymore and I don't wanna be with you anymore.
[This was the text that hurted the most like wow it felt like I was getting killed from inside thats when I started crying and I honestly lost it] 

**I just think it's crazy how people change so fast. Like everything came out of nowhere.**

That is pretty much my story.. and like I said I'm still so confused on what went wrong like we were good and all of a sudden she decides to breakup with me. I don't get it. 
I still cry myself to sleep everyday, thinking about her and if I should try to fix things up, idk? Should I try to get her back? 
I want y'all honest opinion, feel free to say whatever you want I can't be more miserable and affected than I am rn..

And this was my first relationship in yearsssssss so I feel that's why I'm feeling like shit rn, bc I thought I founded everything. all I really wanted from a woman in her. Like personality, etc. 
I gave her way too much expectations. I was honestly so happy and plain with her. I don't see myself without her anymore. I was really in love. 
And I still am.. WHAT SHOULD I DO YOU GUYS?

Besides that in case I have to forget about her I don't know how. I still think about her every day. I cry myself to sleep. I haven't eaten anything in like 4 days.. I've been in my room just sleeping.
Help me, please.

TL:DR I was on a long-term relationship and all of a sudden my gf decided to breakup with me. I'm extremely depressed, confused and I still don't know what to do. Should I try to fix things up? We haven't talked in 2 weeks. I also would like to get an insight from you guys and tips."
When should I have sex with her?,"Hey all. Curious to get your opinions to help my virgin self. I'm a dude in my mid 20s, for context. Was on a date yesterday and she wanted to do the do but I felt like it's too early. When do YOU think is the earliest a couple should do it?"
The Flaws of Modern Dating,"So here's my ***OPINION*** on the flaws of dating in our modern society.

***First off, let me start by prefacing that  I'm a single, hetrosexual  Korean American male, consider myself relatively attractive and relatively fit (whatever) but wanted to put this out there to begin with that so that you are aware of the perspective to which this originates from.***

&#x200B;

One of the biggest flaws in my opinion regarding dating in the modern age is that males overall are basically lost when it comes to understanding where they fall in today's societal role.  I'm often lost as to what if any role I play anymore in today's society?  Where do I fit in?  Does it fucking matter any more?  Whereas in the past, this was more defined (breadwinner, head of household, protector, etc) .

Now before you go crazy saying, ""So the fuck what?  Do we have to have roles? blah blah""  This is not my point.  In fact, this is a whole other topic but rather what I'm saying is that when roles are less clear as they are today and completely blurred as they are today, it's hard to gauge in the dating world the roles we play as males in the dating world as well.

This ultimately has an effect because if the roles in the past were more defined, then the roles today should also adjust to the modern dating world as well.  In other words, if the notion of a male working and providing in families are no longer the norm, then males *making the* ***first move*** or ***paying for the first date*** and all of these antiquated roles, shouldn't they ***also*** be adjusted to the changing times?  Also, the notion of women being considered ""sexually promiscuous"" or called a ""slut"" due to simply desiring sex as much as men do, shouldn't that also be adjusted in today's society?  Aren't we way past the notion that having consensual sex is no longer a big deal at any stage of the dating timeline?  Why do we hold on to certain norms, yet not let go of others?  This is one of the major issues I have with modern dating.

&#x200B;

Second, I believe that due to the age of dating apps and social media, we have been more molded to believe there are ""types"" or standards that must be preexist in order to even have a chance in any sort of engagement whatsoever.  I can not tell you how often I'm amused by Tinder profiles that state, *""If you're under 6ft tall, swipe left""*.  I'm left laughing out loud and amused thinking that this woman's height requirement will somehow magically spawn a connection with her Tinder date than a shorter guy because height requirements have everything to do with a real connection, right?  So with that said, I'm wondering if I were to put down, *""If you have anything less than  B Cup breasts, swipe left""*  is any more damaging or less offensive?

Of course there is nothing wrong with having standards,  but  the reality is that absolutely ***NO ONE*** falls into a ***perfect list*** or set of ***preexisting standards*** that will ever match ***BEFORE*** you even meet someone.  Thus, this endless swiping of lefts and endless non matching continues to pervade our society.

Have you noticed that on dating apps that allow you to pick categories or filter your matches in their search engine come up with less matches when you keep adding more filters?  So by that logic, if a dating app has trouble creating  matches due to preexisting qualifications, what does this say about the modern dating world?  And here we are left to wonder, why is it so fucking hard?

&#x200B;

The truth is, it really isn't hard.  I think if we let go of what we ""want"" because the truth is, what we want is irrelevant when it comes to a human being, because ***EVERYONE*** comes as a unique package full of  very specific and varied experiences and feelings and simply having an open mind of experiencing a person  and connecting with a person rather than checking off standards and ""red flags""  would make the dating world so much easier.

Alas, we don't live there.  We are now in a world of disconnected and entitled people who are more image obsessed, instant obsessed, and status or financially  obsessed.  We live in a world full of unrealistic standards, and ""don't waste my time"", bots, fake profiles, cash money apps before replying, instagram click bait cam girls, ghosting as a normal way to communicate etc.  Thus, in my opinion, the existence of Tinder and how within *nanoseconds* we put our entire self worth in a swipe, is just damaging to our mental well being beyond repair.

&#x200B;

Maybe I will never find my true happiness in a relationship, but that's ***TOTALLY*** ok with me.  Because I want to experience an organic relationship filled with all the ups and downs, including the tears and frustrations. But I want to live without the ***NEED*** of being with someone but rather the desire to experience life together with someone I want to be with and truly wants to be with me.  Because no one person is the answer to happiness.  I am the answer to my own happiness.

This reminds me of how often I used to go to parties and wonder why I wasn't having a good time?  Why when I arrived home after the party that  I was happiest?  After countless parties, I realized that the reason for this was that I was fully expecting the party to make me happy.  I would simply show up expecting all of these mental images to take place and end up disappointed and frustrated if this didn't play out by the end of the night.  ***How utterly ridiculous I had been.***  The party itself is ***only*** providing a venue and the ***opportunity*** for me to have a good time.  The real party exists within me.  ***I am responsible to create my own party and fun.***  Search high and wide and you will never find *""the ultimate fun venue""* that *""epic party""* you saw in that movie.  There will never ever be a *""fun""* venue.  ***I make it fun for myself.***  I can't tell you how many times the most fun I've ever had was telling jokes and laughing outside on a quiet porch at a house  party with a group of people I took the chance with to introduce myself to.  Or the countless times I went on amazing dates and had relationships with girls whom I found interesting and struck up a random conversation with no preexisting intentions or expectations at all.  10 out of 10 times this always happened when I honestly and genuinely only wanted to have a great time and great conversation, nothing more and nothing less.

In the same light, thinking that going on countless dates or even being in a relationship will result in my happiness is just as unhealthy and destructive because nobody wants to be with someone that expects this from them.  This is by definition unfair and unrealistic.  How can someone carry the weight of your happiness on their shoulders?  Absolutely no one should have to carry this responsibility.  Relationships, I believe flourish because both people can stand on their own.  ***Expecting the other person will fulfill anything in your life is just as bad as arriving to a party and expecting the party itself to make your evening fun***. That being said, I believe that ""the one"" does ***NOT*** exist but rather, a random connection that happens when two people randomly decide to make the effort and take the random  chance of wanting to give it a go and see what happens.  Failure is a huge part of this formula as everything is based on a random chance of things working and that's totally fine and ok.  And more likely than not, you will fail of course more often than succeed.  In the end, we have always been the gatekeepers of our own happiness in every situation of life.    And that I believe will never change.    Ok, I'm done.  Vent completed.  Thank you so much for listening and reading this rather long excerpt from my perspective."
Had a girl judge me for having one pic on Instagram,"This girl I met on a dating website was hot. 9/10. She's talking a lot, lightning fast answers. Then she asks if I have Instagram. I told her I just made it, it's nothing to look at. A few minutes go by, no request accepted. Then she says ""it's kind of scary because I don't know if you're real"". 20 minutes go by. Then I say, ""you know a Instagram doesn't prove that more than a dating app right""? ""Yes, I know"", she says. And that was it. Wtf? Do people really judge you based on fucking Instagram?

Edit: Wow, lots of opinions, and some strong ones. Some people seem to think I have a lack of concern for a girl's safety. Not so, at all. I can really see where this girl was coming from--at first I thought it was a question on whether or not she was shallow, but to her this probably was more about her validation of me ""being a real person"" i.e. not a catfish. And in that regard, yes, I did blow it. What my original butthurt-ness was about, was the immediate disqualification I got. But I know that no one on a dating app is under any obligation to keep talking."
I found him,"After so many heart breaks and dumb tinder dates, I talked my crush over a year and he told me I am the person who will make him a better man. He's willing to open up to me after being so reserved and loves me for who I am. I'm so happy and all of my friends approve and know he's an amazing man. Thank you for hearing me out and giving me the confidence to talk to him Reddit. I think I found the man who will love me for who I truly am. We've agreed we'll both give a 140% and love each other entirely. 😊"
I was supposed to go on a date today.,"But instead I’m just going to go home, put on a face mask, make some dinner and knit.

Does anyone ever feel discouraged about dating? And feel like it is completely and utterly exhausting? 


I’ve been coming across people who are incredibly superficial and generic. I just want a genuine person who cares about the things that matter. Why am I having such a hard time finding one?


And the ones I do find myself actually liking are either already taken or just have not shown any interest in me. It’s exhausting. 

So I’m going to knit."
Me: “So I guess I’m your gf now? :)” Him: “We don’t need to worry about labels”,"So I’ve been seeing a man several times a week for the last 5 months. He’s awesome, I’m awesome. We stay up many nights chatting for hours. We have met each other’s friends. Our goals seem to align. He always tells me I’m the hottest woman he’s ever dated.

Upfront, he told me he was looking for a serious, monogamous, committed relationship. But we had never defined the relationship before.

Well, we were talking about holiday plans this year and meeting each other’s family. He was open to meeting mine but a little hesitant about me meeting his because his family lives farther away and isn’t that close with the ones still living. But I thought to myself “wow we made it this far, I’m just going to confirm I’m his girlfriend :)”

So I say “haha I guess I’m your girlfriend now!” after talking about these travel plans. Totally expecting him to say “of course :)” or something like that.

Instead, he replies with “We don’t really need labels. I mean I would never want to put this on Facebook or anything. I like to keep my dating life completely separate from any of my social media or anything public like that. That’s just how I am.” I did think it was a little fishy because he had never posted a photo of me/us on social media before either.

Is this a red flag after 5 months? 

Should I be walking away? Or is this normal these days?"
Dating Advice; take it or leave it,"I scroll through this sub often and see alot of similar questions asked. While I'm no expert I'm fairly attuned with myself and can see the trends in what many face issues with in the dating game.

The first piece of advice is to be honest with yourself and others, right from the start. As plain and simple as this sounds, it's a big one. Nowadays dating is mostly done online and stats say in the next 20 years almost 70% relationships will be formed online. It's really easy to make a fancy tinder/online profile with a witty bio and put your best images forward, but try and be real here. The more real you are with someone right from the start; the more real they will be with you and you don't have to pretend to impress them and follow up on being someone you are not. This will hopefully weed out the superficial people for you and save a whole lot of drama. 

The next piece of advice is learn to read others and don't be oblivious to the fact they are not interested. Ghosting is the most obvious sign somebody doesn't want a whole lot more to do with you. Nobody likes conflict hence the majority choose to ghost. Yea it sucks but if you ignore it and are clinging on to that little bit of hope that they will get back to you, you're wasting your time and missing out on potential opportunities with people who will actually respond and give you the time of day.

The next piece of advice is to make sure you never make someone your sole reliant for happiness. The root of suffering is attachment. Love can be a crazy thing and happen very fast but be mindful to this and try to make sure you reserve some of yourself for if things are to all of a sudden take an unexpected turn. We humans are very intricate things and nobody will ever perceive reality quite the same as you, as much as you might want them to.

Lastly, be confident in yourself. Don't ever be scared of rejection. It is way easier said than done but life is very short. If someone is making eyes with you a few times and your gut instinct is telling you there might be something of chemistry there, go talk to them and find out. The worst that can happen is they laugh and tell you no. Don't be scared of words. It's literally just words. Even asking someone and being rejected will give you so much more confidence for the next time.

I hope this can be of help to some of you out there. Good luck and much love beautiful humans

How lucky in life you have to be to find someone crazy about you and vice versa.,"I’ve been putting myself out in the dating world since last year. I haven’t had trouble finding dates. But I just find it amazing how people can find a long term significant other. I am mind boggled people can somehow find a person they can connect and have chemistry with and the feelings are reciprocated. Also, the timing. The timing is right (ie. I found this connection but he is really focusing on his career right now). I’m not losing hope. But I am now understanding that luck is a factor in dating as well."
Filters,"Online dating is frustrating when you look through a girls profile and all you see is Filters of them with animal faces. I don't think this is cute, and I wish for this trend to just stop. Just be your self in your photos. I feel like I am catfished when I am being shown misrepresentation of what they look like."
