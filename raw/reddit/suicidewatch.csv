My girlfriend killed herself a week after we broke up,"Hello. I don't really know how to start this. I guess I'll tell you how I met my ex.

Roughly 2 years ago, I was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. As a side note, I've struggled with depression for most of my life, and have had alcohol dependency issues for many many years. While I was in the hospital, I met this girl. We talked a few times, and she told me that she was being treated for depression also, though she didn't seem very depressed at first. She told me stories about her ""previous life"" as a med student, and how she failed out of med school. I found myself drawn to her charms. Not much later, she left the facility because the treatment wasn't working for her. I gave her my number, and she texted me that same day. For 2 weeks, we would text all day, talking about everything; mostly how bored we were, she with her life at her apartment all alone, and I with the therapies. We realized that we really liked each other and went out on a date. Then another, and another. I was so happy to have found someone who understood the things that I had been going through. We were a couple before we even knew it.

Things were still difficult for both of us, but they were near perfect when it came to our relationship. I got discharged from the hospital and started focusing on healing myself before looking for a job. She was supposedly doing the same thing. She came over often, to the point where she would need to ask her mom to look after her cat while she was with me. She met my son. Things started getting more and more clear to me though. She slept a lot. And I mean A LOT, up to 18 hours a day. She was bored all the time. Thinking about finding a job gave her anxiety. There were days when she'd lay in bed all day, get up to do something, and then get an anxiety attack and need to get back in bed. I won't say that it wasn't somewhat tough on me too to see her like that, but I always hoped for it to get better. She'd have good days where she would meal prep for an entire week for the both of us, or make 3 paintings, or talk about going back to school, but it was the minority of her days. I loved her though, and despite her depression she was sweet and caring and funny, and she got along great with my son.

After a year or so, I decided that I needed to start looking for a job. I found it so quickly that I was kind of stunned by it, but happy, of course. She was really happy for me too. I enjoyed my job at first, but found it pretty stressful, even from the beginning. Months passed, and the stress started building up. I started drinking again. Small amounts, at first. I tried to hide it from my girlfriend, but she caught on pretty quickly. She tried helping me. I wouldn't let her. The drinking got worse. I'd come home from the bar late at night to find her waiting up for me, and we'd argue, which I usually had forgotten the next morning because of how drunk I was. She told me that I shouted at her, insulted her, made her cry. I'd be so ashamed, ask her to forgive me, to please please please give me another chance, promised that I would stop drinking. And I would. For a while. Then it would all repeat itself again.

One night I came home late again and we did the same old routine. The next morning, I found her in the garage with her bags packed. Said I had said all kinds of nasty things to her, as I had so many times before. But this time was different. She told me that I had said I didn't give a fuck about her. That I wanted her to leave. And when she started sobbing, I shouted at her to sob less loudly because I couldn't hear my music. I couldn't believe it, I just couldn't. At first I thought she was bluffing about leaving, but when she started silently crying I knew I had fucked up. I told her, of course I don't want you to leave. And then I begged her to stay. Her mom eventually arrived and took her away.

I tried calling her so many times, on her cell and even her parents' landline. I got her mom on the phone once, and she confirmed that she was there, but she didn't want to talk to me. 

One week later, I got a call from her sister. She hanged herself. She apparently left a note, saying how lonely she was, and how I had been her only friend. How terrible it was to hear from her only friend that he didn't care. How it had been the last straw.

I feel sick even writing this. I killed her. I killed the woman I loved. I've been sober for 5 months now, but it's not enough. It's never going to be enough. I feel so guilty. I miss her so much. Lately I've been feeling suicidal again myself. All I want is to be with her again. If I could only tell her how sorry I am. But I can't.

Thanks for reading to the end."
Raped in front of my girlfriend. feeling like giving up.," 

I don't know what to say or do, I just feel like my life is falling apart.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I’ll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I’m late with this, I’ve just been going through a lot. I’m gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that’s went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I’m not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I’m currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I’ve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn’t start therapy, but I’m considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there’s no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you’ve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you."
i swear to god if there's an afterlife i'm gonna be so pissed,"if i go through all the fucking trouble of coming up with this shitty plan just to wake up on some couch in hell wih satan being life ""enjoy existing forever"" imma fucking beat his ass"
Just called the suicide hotline,"... and was asked to please 'watch my language.'

The actual fuck.

Yea, I have a mouth on me. Yea, I have an attitude problem. But how the FUCK you going to work at a suicide hotline, even the fucking graveyard shift (heh -- suicide hotline; graveyard shift -- heh), and tell callers their language BOTHERS you? How you gonna LET that language bother you? It's WORDS, you fucking TWAT-NOZZLE. It's a HURTING HUMAN expressing herself.

Jesus fuck."
throwing away my blades today,"been self harming since 12, i’m 22. 

i’m 3 days self harm free.

going to throw my blades away today and fight the good fight.

wish me luck, fellas"
I’ve seen child porn on the internet. I will never be the same again.,"I saw it on twitter. Multiple accounts. I cybertipped them all. There were so many videos. After a while I lost my head and I had to stop. I couldn’t report anymore accounts. I didn’t want to look at them. In the process of reporting one of the videos I thought I accidentally lost the link and freaked out at the thought of having to go back to copy the link again. I will never be the same. There is true evil in this world. I don’t trust men or women anymore. Everyone is a monster. There were so many women in these videos. So many. For a long time afterwards I was paranoid I was a pedophile, a freak, a creep for having seen them, although I am a bisexual woman who has only ever been with people my age or older. I feel just as bad for having seen it. I feel immense guilt for tapping out and not reporting every single account. I just could not watch that shit anymore."
Not a single person actually cares unless you kill yourself,"If you say you're so depressed you can't function it's ""Aw it'll get better"" and they forget about you. Then when you kill yourself everyone's like ""Oh I never would've thought, I wish he would've given some sort of sign.""


I said how many times I want to kill myself and I think I might do it, but I know if I do people will act like it's a huge surprise.


I've been serious all along. I have a rope tied into a noose in a box in my room, so that it's always ready. I'm not joking or just looking for attention when I tell people I need some kind of help. Everybody only pretends to care and then when you're dead tries to say they cared all along"
I wish I could swap places with a person who died that wanted to live.,"There’s so many people in this world who wanted to live, but died too young in a cruel twist of fate. Cancer. Car accident. Murder. I feel so selfish that I’m still here instead, when I don’t even want to be. If I could swap places with a person like that, I’d do it without hesitation. At this point I’m only alive out of a sense of obligation."
"I am never ""suicidal enough"" to be heard. I am too well-dressed, too articulate, too friendly ""too"" everything to be worthy of any support.","And I am gradually withering away because of it.

Mental health professionals never take me seriously. I can see it in the hint of amusement in their eyes, their disengaged body language, their patronising tone of voice. They say I'm ""too"" well-dressed, ""too"" articulate, ""too"" intelligent. I am ""too"" kind, I smile ""too"" often, I'm ""too"" calm.

This has not only been offensive to me, but it is such an insult to people who are mentally ill and suicidal. Their implication that suicidal people are dumb, frenzied and rude slobs was - and still is - fucking preposterous.

I have tried to get help for approximately 8 years. I have begged and pleaded and been reduced to tears. But unless I'm trying to end my life right now in front of them, it doesn't matter. None of it matters. I don't matter. 

My public face is ""too"" convincing. But this was carefully created and crafted, over many years, because I had no choice. I had no option but to hide the abuse and isolation and pain I have suffered behind a smile. I was never given an alternative, and when someone glimpsed the reality behind this façade, they did nothing.

The truth is, a part of me is frightened of dying, and my survival instincts kick in when I don't want them to. But that doesn't mean I want to live, either. If I could switch off this deeply ingrained fear and just be done with it, I would. 

Why do we have to kill ourselves or almost die before people care? Why do we have to present ourselves in a specific way before we even get listened to? Why do they wait until every glimmer of hope and willingness to live has been stamped out? I hate this. I hate my life. I hate myself. Let me be what they want me to be, please.

**EDIT:** I never ever _ever_ consider others as ""dumb, frenzied, rude slobs"" by the way. I'm so sorry if I made anyone feel that way. It's simply how I interpret the reaction of mental health professionals, when they say ""But you're so clever/hygienic/pretty/well-groomed"" etc. It feels like a slap in the face, as though suicidal people are looked down on if they are well presented, and looked down on if they are not, too (but the latter apparently ticks more boxes from their point of view).
If someone is unkempt, hasn't showered, is visibly distressed or less coherent, I do NOT judge them or advocate doing so. _But using someone's appearance as a way of invalidating their pain? That's **completely** wrong._


**EDIT 2:** Thank you everyone for your supportive comments and sharing your experiences on this subject. It means a lot to me and although it is awful that this resonates with so many people, it also brings me comfort. I am sorry for not responding to everyone yet. If you have had a similarly invalidating experience, I am so sorry. I appreciate the difficulty internalising this, but it is _not_ your fault. You are not to blame for the misconduct of any medical professional, who ought to know better than to belittle us during our darkest and most vulnerable moments.


In positive developments, the crisis team visited me at home this evening. Both mental health nurses listened to me, emphasised that the way I was treated for the last 8 years was unacceptable, completely validated my feelings and showed a lot of empathy. It has restored a little bit of faith in the NHS. They are going to report back to the psychiatry team and recommend that I be allocated a Care Co-ordinator, who will be able to assist me with being prescribed the correct forms of treatment and provide support with finances and social connections. I have not allowed myself to anticipate too much, but I cried with relief after they left. I hope they keep their word. I hope they meant it. I desperately just hope. Until I receive an outcome, I will sincerely try to stay alive. I am not in a position to promise that I will survive, but I can promise that I will try, one more time."
I hate how people dismiss us when we openly say that we are suicidal but when someone keep quiet and kill them selves people be shocked like “They never said anything I didn’t know” WAKE TF UP AND LOVE ME STOP DISMISSING HOW I FEEL,"My parents kicked me out for being suicidal, now a family friend killed himself and they are all suffering not knowing why because he was relatively “happy” and had a good life... Meanwhile my mother while I was panicking she handed me a knife."
"I receive two messages a day, one that my phone is at 15%, and the other that my phone is at 5%.","edit: Thank you for the kind words everyone, each and every one of you brightened my day a bit. Also GOLD HYPERS!"
"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly."
"Sorry folks, we've got a troll: Please message the moderators if you get harassed via PM after posting here.","We are **so** sorry that this is necessary.

In recent days we've been targeted by a PM troll who's been sending pro-suicide messages to people after they post here.  The admins have suspended the main account this person was using, and they're looking out for alts, but if these types of individuals sometimes try to get around their site-wide bans.  We feel it's better to let you know this might happen again so that you can be forewarned, and also so that if it does happen, we and the reddit community team will be alerted as soon as possible.

If you get a hateful, pro-suicide PM, please be aware that this person is doing this indiscriminately, and they probably haven't even read what you posted, so it's *not about you*.  

If you don't think you could handle receiving something like that, we completely understand.  In that case, your best protection is to set your messaging preference so that you can receive PMs from trusted users only before you post (anywhere, not just here) about your struggles.

"“If you truly wanted to kill yourself and wasn’t seeking attention, you’d just do it and tell no one so no one could stop you”","Yeah because I DONT WANT TO FUCKING DO IT, but I’m out of options and want the feeling to stop! It’s 20 fucking 20, why is opening up about suicide still “selfish” and “grow up” and “stop attention seeking” IM ASKING FOR FUCKING HELP YOU BLIND FUCKS. 

Oh and when someone else opens up about it, it’s all love and support and strength but when DICKHEAD FAILURE me does, I’m a weirdo and “negative” and “selfish” and “playing games”. 

I will not kill myself. I will just sit here, suffer, and hate the fucking world until the day I die."
I tried to kill myself two months ago because my parents won't stop blaming me for my sister's death,"Hello, I'm Gretel, 18 year old Mexican female. I want to be brief, I tried to kill myself two months ago. My psychologist told me about this social media site so I come to share what I feel.

I jumped off my house rooftop (3 story-house) butI only broke my arm. I feel stupid because I couldn't kill myself. 

All my suicidal thoughts started when at age 5, I accidentally caused an accident which killed my sister. She was my twin, 5 as well. My parents won't stop blaming me for her death. We were playing on my house stairs and I stumbled and made a decoration statue fell on her head. I cannot forgive myself for that even if my psychologist has already told me I'm not the one to blame.

Sorry about my English, I speak Spanish as my first language."
Does anybody not worry about their future because they don't expect to be alive by then?,"I don't even care anymore, since I know I'll end up jumping off a building before I actually have to do something with my life. It's relieving actually"
"People always say; ""just"" get a job, ""just"" find a new hobby, ""just"" go for a walk, ""just"" make new friends. Newsflash: IT DOESN'T FUCKING WORK.","Every conversation I have had about suicide in recent memory with mental health professionals or volunteers has included variations of the following:

""Have you considered listening to music?""

""Have you considered going for a walk?""

""Have you considered taking up a new hobby?""

""Have you considered making new friends?""

""Have you considered volunteering/getting a job?""

It happens every time. It happens in every conversation. It happened yesterday, and it happened twenty minutes ago. I finally summoned the courage to text a helpline for the first time because I just can't call one, and this is the only ""help"" I received.

Fuck yes. Fuck yes I have _considered_ every possible option and opportunity to make me **not** imagine shooting a bullet in my skull or dragging a blade across my throat or tying a rope around my neck.

Here's the problem: **It never works.**

I have had meaningful employment and voluntary roles that I genuinely enjoyed. I have socialised and met plenty of lovely people. I have spent the last six years in a loving and nurturing relationship with a wonderful man. I have taken long, beautiful strolls in nature by the river. I have fed the ducks and petted dogs and helped the elderly and looked after children. I have listened to music and played the piano and sang my favourite songs. 

The thing is, I can't walk without imagining myself hurling my body in front of a car, or drowning in the lake, or lying on the train tracks. I can't bake a cake from scratch without imagining myself plunging the kitchen knife into my wrists and bleeding out all over the counter. I can't meet new people without withdrawing, isolating myself and remembering that I am a burden. I am a parasite. I am worthless and I need to just die. I can't trust anyone because I have been abused and broken and betrayed so profoundly that everyone feels like a potential threat, the next predator. I can't work or volunteer or commit to anything without my joints aching and my bones creaking, without my mind spiralling and without my energy slipping away until I can barely move anymore. I can't enjoy a hug with my boyfriend without imagining him choking the life out of me. 

I can't do **anything** without wanting to die and picturing the multitude of ways I could end my life. I could be having an amazing day and feel so much relief because wow, for once I feel _good_. The thoughts will linger in the background and watch. They will creep a little closer and whisper in my ear and stand in front of me then climb inside my brain to remind me that they are still here - that they will **always** be here, no matter what I do to distract myself, to find hope, to find meaning. 

I'm lost. I'm lonely. I'm alienated. I'm tired. It is so difficult to find people who understand, because ""try not to kill yourself"" is not a part of everyone's daily routine. It's not on everyone's to-do list.

I have considered everything. I have tried everything. And I still want to die. Every. Fucking. Day.

"People say life gets better, but that’s a fucking lie.","I’m 25. I’ve been a depressed, anxious, suicidal mess since I was 12 years old. I’m sick of people saying it gets better. It doesn’t. Everything is more complicated now. Bills are piling up around me. For years I was told I should get a credit card so I could build credit. Finally did it and immediately ruined my credit score. I’m in debt. I can barely afford rent and groceries. I’m not qualified for any decent jobs. I have no skills or talents or even interests anymore. I’m not even pretty or funny or social or anything to make up for being so pathetic. I’m literally just fucking done trying"
"I’m sorry, but I’m going to do it. My cat must know, he is on my lap. At midnight I will do it. Please help me. Any body. I’m honestly done. I don’t care if I’m 13. I just want it to end","I haven’t told anybody how I’m feeling because I don’t want to go to the mental hospital. The mental hospital is hell. If it wasn’t there I would be talking to my parents. I would be getting help. But I can’t, I know the consequences. The hospital punishes me. I would use a hotline but I don’t want police coming to my house. I’m scared. I’m the most scared I’ve been in my life. 





I know nobody will read this, but here I want to tell my story. The truth is, I want to live. I just want the pain to stop. 




I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand. 



Here is my first goodbye.  To my dolls: I love you. I know when I leave you will go to. I’m sorry. My heart breaks. I wish I could’ve taken care of you better. You saved my life 2 times. You helped me when I needed it the most. I will say all your names. I love all of you. I’m in tears. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want to go. Kazumi, Sayaka, Kyoko, Mami, Madoka, Luka, Rin, Homura, Yachiyo, Iroha, Sana, Felicia, Tsuruno, Nikki, Ren, Rena, Mitama, Alina, Kanade, Sakura, Rika, Gumi, Emma, Ruby, Weiss, Blake, Yang, Yowane, Nagisa. I’m so sorry. I love you. All of you




To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know, I love you. I love you so much Binxy. 




I don’t know what to do. I want help. But I can’t with out going to the hospital. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Hold my hand. Give me a hug. Anything. With one final cry, please. I don’t want to go. But I can’t stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry."
Chocolate saved my life,"My last serious suicide attempt was in July 2018. I had booked a hotel in a nearby city for two days for ''a conference'' and randomly packed up so it wouldn't be suspicious to my mom. I didn't want to do it in my room because in a way I didn't want to defile it? I don't know how to explain it. 
My plan was to do it as soon as I got to the hotel because thinking about it and postponing makes it more difficult and I wanted to make sure nothing would stop me. 
I opened my suitcase to grab my toiletries bag that had my pills but when I opened the suitcase, something dropped on the floor. It was my favorite chocolate, 70% dark cocoa with candied orange bits. It had a little heart sticker sticked on the wrapper. My heart dropped and I couldn't stop crying. Eventually I think I fell asleep on the floor holding the chocolate and when I woke up, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. I felt loved. My mom put that chocolate there to surprise me because she knows how sometimes I'll forget to eat when I'm overworked. 
Just wanted to share that with you because I could really use that chocolate today. I really could."
"I'm a COVID-19 nurse in an intensive care unit, and I can't cope","Hello. 

I'm 26 year old and currently work at a COVID-19 ward full of very ill patients.   
I've never struggled as much as I am right now. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I am isolating myself from everyone because I'm afraid of making them ill. I have nothing left to give."
I just saw a post asking “If you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed?”. I can’t think of a single thing.,"When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didn’t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I haven’t felt like dying because I’ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she can’t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if I’m honest, the relationship felt off from right when it happened. I don’t have the heart to tell him because I do love him, but now after years of him being clean he’s relapsed again (shooting heroin and popping benzos). It’s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. I’ve been wanting to break up with him but now he’s in a bad place and I feel stuck. He’s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 4 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. It’s the first year he has ever not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesn’t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I can’t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I don’t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and I’ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I can’t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him I’m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so he’s off the list too.

My mother won’t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I can’t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, I’ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I can’t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason I’m not dead yet and why I’ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

• • • • •

I’m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the “wrong” choice. I’m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, I’ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred I’ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

I’m so, so tired.

Edit: some words."
You ever just leave an awkward conversation and think “Wow. I should really just kill myself.”?,"That’s how all my relationships go. It’s no wonder nobody wants to be around me voluntarily. Sure, I can make people laugh but that’s where my conversational ability ends. I don’t leave conversations feeling like I made a new friend or that I matter to people."
"I wanted to jump off a bridge, but I got a burrito instead.",I bought a second one and gave it to a homeless guy hanging outside the restaurant. It made me feel a bit better for the rest of the night.
I’m an attractive white man from a wealthy family. The odds were always in my favor. I think I’m gonna shoot myself in the face.,"I don’t expect you to read this, just need somewhere to vent. 

Here I am again, sitting alone in front of my tiny space heater, trying to find a reason to keep going. It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas Eve. I’m basically a 24 year old virgin and have spent holidays alone for the past 5 years. I remember Bill Burr said at like 39yrs old he stopped going home for the holidays. I envy that. At 18 I went to college across the country to get away from my abusive mother, even picked a college she hated (“it would embarrass [her]”). Speaking of college, I’m still unsure whether I was molested. It’s hard to say when you wake up to some guy in your bed. The not knowing really pisses me the fuck off.

To this day my mom doesn’t think she’s done any wrong. After I dropped out I went back home for a little bit. I don’t know what I expected. A year or two later I move across the country again to get away. Now I am truly and utterly alone. I’m currently on my 22nd or 23rd dead-end job. Honestly can’t believe I’ve lasted so long at this one. I guess I look up to the store manager a lot and don’t want to let him down. I’ve seen a hundred therapists, been on a million different meds, went to rehab for 6 months, and I feel worse now than I ever have. Depression, anxiety, paranoia, they’re all too minor to describe what I feel. Had my first suicidal thought at 9yrs old. At that same age I realized I wanted a girlfriend. It was like there was a hole in my heart. I think I just wanted a female in my life because I hated my mother. But I knew I was too young and figured I’d get one later in life - nope. Never been in a real relationship. I was with a girl in high school for a couple months maybe. We sorta had sex once but I wouldn’t even call it that. Every girl I’ve tried to pursue since either wasn’t interested or I didn’t try hard enough / didn’t have enough experience to understand what they wanted me to do. Doesn’t help that I grew up afraid of my mother and hating her. 

In college I was so desperate to get laid I went on Craigslist Casual Encounters (when that was a thing) but girls from my floor found those pictures and passed them around. That shattered the little confidence I had. That is just one experience but probably the one that most changed my perspective of women. I wish I could tell those girls how much damage they’ve done. Then all my fuckups with girls just added to my pain. Dating apps don’t work it’s like my account is invisible. At this point I don’t try whatsoever. It’s as if I’ve been conditioned to not make a move. And the ironic part is I look like a model (genes, muscles, six-pack), dress well, and I’m actually very smart. The few parties I’ve ever gone to girls basically threw themselves at me and I would freak out, have a panic attack, and then leave. Alcohol didn’t help. I’m not gay. I’m just broken. A beautiful girl might look at me and give all the signs that she wants me to talk to her. She might even come talk to me first. I’ll just shut down. Afterward I’ll get angry at myself, so I’ve stopped going places where I might meet a girl because I know what’s going to happen. I’ve always found it interesting how much I relate to “ugly” guys who won’t pursue a woman because they know what will happen. And those guys take one look at me and hate me. It’s like they’re thinking “man, if I could just trade places with that guy.” Hahaha ain’t shit would change, man. You’d be just as alone and maybe feel worse than you already do.

At this point the only reason I haven’t shot myself in the face is because of my dog. My cat wouldn’t give a shit but I can’t do that to my dog. I just can’t. The sad part though is dogs vibe off you and adopt your personality, meaning he’s gone from an angel to anxious and quick to fight other dogs. So, maybe it’d be for the best if he had a different owner. Can’t exactly take him to the dog park anymore. And I’m sure you can tell how close I am to suicide because I know exactly where to shoot. For your sake I’ll spare the details. I don’t know why I’m writing this I guess the holidays are pushing me over the edge. I just can’t be alone anymore. The girl I like is a coworker who shut me down for a different coworker who went and cheated on her. And now I feel like maybe she’s expecting me to make another move?? I don’t know. But the way I am, I’m not gonna pursue a girl who shut me down. You know how hard it was to tell her how I feel? Couldn’t even do it in person had to send some stupid message. Now I have to see her every day. I guess that’s why you don’t ask out people from work. 

I have panic attacks every night and the thin walls in this ghetto apartment complex do NOT help, nor do the gunshots down the street. I have no one to call. My dad kind of understands what I’m going through but there’s only so much he can handle. Every time I talk to him I feel like he’s about to have a heart attack. My brother says I have an illness that just needs to be treated. I feel like he thinks I just want attention. Obviously I don’t talk to my mom, I actually blocked her. And the suicide hotline?!?! Don’t get me started. It’s like they want you to die. The two real friends I had forgot about me once they found girlfriends. I don’t know how much time I have left, and I always thought I was destined for big things. You’re all I have left, reddit. You and my dog. Shit, the cat probably wants me gone. 

If you read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, this was more helpful than rehab. And yes I love my cat. He’s actually really interesting, basically a real-life Garfield.

EDIT 2: I think Dave Chappelle said it best when he talked about Anthony Bourdain. That’s why I used that title. I can’t stand when people think I “have it all,” so how can I be so unhappy. Anyway thank you again, everyone. And thank you for the platinum, whatever it means, that made my day.

EDIT 3: I am either delusional or my coworkers read this post. Not sure which is worse. But it really feels like one of them read it and passed that shit along like a hot potato. I hear them talking and I hope it’s just confirmation bias but it sounds like they’re talking and laughing about what I wrote. WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING YOU FUCKS?! More gossip to gobble up? One of the guys here tried to have a real talk with me, “how bad are these intrusive thoughts getting?” I haven’t been acting different at work. Why would he ask me that? I did have people contact me saying they weren’t on this sub but found it just scrolling through r/all, so I don’t know how many people actually read this. I guess it’s possible someone I know came across it. Funny that I care when I’m so close to ending it all. Glad I got it off my chest though, was a huge weight lifted. And the support from you guys was unreal. I didn’t respond to everyone but I read every single message and comment. Speaking of which, you trolls can go fuck yourselves. It takes a special kind of twisted fuck to hide behind a keyboard and say that shit. But it turns out this post helped some people?? That’s such a foreign feeling for me I didn’t believe them. I don’t know why I’m still writing. I just hate being me. Need this life shit to end."
"People who say “it’s a bad day, not a bad life” are the fucking worst","It IS a bad life. Do you rly think I wanna kill myself bc I had one bad day? Fuck no. It’s because every single day of my life is a battle. Every step, every blink, every breath takes so much willpower. 

Depression can’t even be cured. People say it’s “not logical” to kill your self, but it really is for me at least. It WONT get better. Depression can only be suppressed. I’ll have to live with this horrible pain for the rest of my life. And the things in my life that make it worse are even more unbearable because they’ll NEVER go away, no matter what some fucking stranger who doesn’t even know what I’ve been through says. 

So don’t say any of those shallow ass phrases. If ur gonna say those then get OUT of here bc ur just making things worse."

Edit:  In response to multiple requests, I'm adding a definition of activism here:  ""campaigning to bring about political or social change"".  That's straight out of the OED, we aren't making any special interpretation of it. **Any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rules.**

Some examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here, all of which are totally inappropriate:  

* Advocating for changes in laws around suicide

* Advocating for change in the mental-health system 

* Advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mental-health.  These are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes, e.g. World Suicide Prevention Day

Keep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support.  Any post that's not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the ""Mod Approved"" flair."
I’m a Nurse who killed people,"I can’t shake the guilt. I caught covid from a patient in the hospital I work at full time. I work at a nursing home per diem, and went there while I had a slight cough. The day after I worked there I was incredibly sick, and found out my patient at the hospital had tested positive and moved to a ventilator in the ICU. They eventually died and were the first death in my state from the virus. Right now 30 people in the nursing home are positive with covid.

I just graduated from nursing school a few months ago. I have no paid time off, and the three weeks I was out with covid made me have to empty my savings and use my credit just to pay the bills.

Mentally I’m not ok. I don’t think I am coping well. I drink too much. I have been watching suicide videos and been jealous of their courage to go through with it. 

I feel so good when I work in the hospital. But then I’m isolated in my apartment by myself. My girlfriend of five years broke up with me while I was sick with the virus. She had been in PA school in a differed state and has started talking to another guy. 

I just don’t feel good. I cope with alcohol. I have no other outlets. I have scheduled myself to work 50+ this week just so I am not alone in my bed.

Honestly, I feel like I have been screwed. I was on the frontlines treating this disease before PPE and isolation measures were in place. Now work three weeks off after getting sick I can barely keep with the bills. 

I just want to sleep. I sleep all day, because when I sleep I don’t hurt or think about those I have killed. As a new nurse I don’t think I’m prepared mentally for isolation and tragedy.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words. I’m still hurt, but I’m coping. I started reaching out to people. I am going into a program to stop drinking so much. I am safe. I just needed to vent, thanks for allowing me to do so."
"3 days ago was my birthday, I should’ve done it but my dog and a redditor saved my life","3 days ago was my birthday. I am getting depressed when my birthday comes since it is supposed to be a happy day, but I know that nothing special will happen.

My birthday was the worst, my friends didn’t even greet me, my boss fired up for some reason that wasn’t my fault and got mad at me, I ate alone and like nobody cares about me. I treated myself a good meal for my birthday, an Italian Spaghetti and Pepperoni Pizza. I thought of that as my last meal, and had cookies and cream ice cream for dessert. I would end it that night, or the day after tomorrow. I evaluated all the important persons in my life if I leave them. My mother would hurt, but I know she can manage. My brother doesn’t even care about me. My girlfriend is just using me since if she doesn’t have me, she’s nothing, and that’s the only reason why I haven’t left her since I know once I did that, she’ll kill herself. My “bestfriend” only talks to me when he have problems but when It is me who has problems, he’s not replying to me so I think I wouldn’t be a big loss for him. 

After hours of thinking and finally decided to do it, I remembered my dog. He would never understand what happened to me if I’d kill myself. I can’t stand the fact that he’ll wait for me to come back after a week, a month, a year, or until the day he dies because I am already dead. I cried and hugged my dog tightly. “You saved my life buddy. You’re the reason I’m still here” I said to him while he just stands there staring at me. 

After that, I just browsed reddit just today and saw something on my inbox. A stranger awarded my last post with a silver. “God loves you. Be easy on yourself.” He said to me. At that moment, I started to cry like a fucking bitch because even if I didn’t know him/her, I felt that someone hugged me and concerned about me. 

To you random redditor who gave a silver (I consider it a gold because of your kind words), I wanted to let you know that it is you who made my birthday special. I love you. 

To my dog, Bay, you’re the greatest doggo of all. Imma buy you all the treats you want. You’re the reason why I’m here. I love you so much.


EDIT: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS MY INBOX IS GETTING FLOODED WITH SUPPORT, SILVERS AND A PLATINUM. I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT. I NEVER FELT LOVED LIKE THIS BEFORE. TO ALL WHO MESSAGED ME SAYING THAT THEY ARE GLAD THAT I’M STILL HERE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALSO THOSE PEOPLE WHO COMMENTED ON THIS POST. I CAN’T REPLY TO YOU ALL ONE BY ONE BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. IMMA LET MY DOG KNOW THAT HE GOT SO MUCH RECOGNITION FOR BEING SUCH A GOOD BOI. THANK YOU SO MUCH STRANGERS WHO MADE ME FELT THAT THEY LOVE ME AND CARE FOR ME SO MUCH. I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️"
"Just called suicide hotline. Thanks, Tom.","I called the suicide hotline because I’ve been sad for a long time. Had enough norco to overdose and almost did. Instead, I called a suicide hotline and was connected with Tom. He coached cross country. I run cross country and track for my university. He said he is now a fan of my team and will watch for my name on the leaderboards. Thanks for giving me even the slightest reason to keep going, Tom. "
It’s extremely messed up that you can’t even go to a psych hospital for help with suicidal thoughts without getting a multi-thousand dollar hospital bill.,"I was in a psych ward once when I was 17. I struggle with suicidal ideation daily. I would totally go back and get treatment at a hospital again if it weren’t for the horrible treatment of patients and the bill that would come along with it. My bill at my psych hospital was about $20,000. All because I wanted to jump off a bridge. You can’t tell anyone that you’re suicidal without them throwing you in a mental hospital, but you can’t go to a mental hospital without owing thousands of dollars and being treated like a prisoner, just making your problems even worse. There’s no good solution. I want to have the right to die. Or at least get free help. The suicidal hotline doesn’t do shit. I want real help. And not to be thrown in a hospital. This system is horrible. We are all victims of it. It’s time for a mental health industry overhaul."
"""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem."" .... Yeah that sounds fucking amazing.","Who doesn't want a ""permanent solution""? I don't want teen temporary solution, I want everything to stop.

Sorry that it’s also me isolating myself and keeping conversations short, because I want to kill myself.

I've gone to a hotel at the other end of the country to kill myself,"I'm due to head back tomorrow, at least that's what I've told people. I've quit my job because it's fucking pointless. None of this matters, life is arbitrary. We're thrown into a system completely devoid of any compassion, this isn't life, this is servitude and I refuse to play along anymore. I'm so fucking tired of plastering a smile on my face and pretending like everything is going to be okay. 

Have you looked at the news lately? Everything is falling apart around us, the planet is on fire, people are being rounded up, privacy is non-existent and we're told repeatedly that we have no value unless we've been commoditized. Buy this, buy that, you need this random, useless tatt but we don't! We don't *need* any of it but it's still rammed down our throats day in, day out, bombarding us from every fucking direction and I'm just exhausted. 

I can't do this for another 40 years, I'm done, I'm checking out and I don't mean from the hotel. I'm going to have a large gin and tonic while I run a bath. It might relax me amd there's a niggling voice at the back of mind screaming ""PLEASE DON'T DO THIS"" but I don't want to listen anymore. 

Mum, if by chance you happen to read this, please know that I love you and I'm truly, truly sorry for putting you through this. For what it's worth I'm so glad that you enjoyed Silverstone. I love you. I love you I fucking love you and im sorry

Edit: I'm still here. This has been the most difficult 24 hours of my life but I'm still here. I took the train back today and told my mum I needed to speak to her urgently, as soon as I saw her I told her I loved her, I told her why I went to a hotel and then I broke down in tears like an absolute mess. She told me she couldn't stand the thought of burying one of her sons, we hugged and I cried on her for about 20 minutes. I'm back at home now and reading most of the responses here has been overwhelming. I still don't think I can go on, but I think I'm going to at least try, until it becomes unbearable again anyway."
“You can talk to me about anything”,Afterwards they hit you with the “I don’t know what to say” line followed by “you should see a therapist”. That’s how I learned to never to pour my heart out
This quote about suicide is feeling far too accurate,"""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""

This quote is from Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace.

I'm honestly starting to feel the flames, and the jump is looking far too comforting."
"Anyone else here ""suicidal but not suicidal""?","I'm suicidal, but not *suicidal.*

Know what I mean?

In other words, I'm not ""suicidal""-suicidal.

Know what I mean?

That's not to say I'm doing it for attention, though, either. (That's a common assumption/misconception). My pain is very real. My feelings of wanting to die are pretty genuine.

Basically:

**I was just wondering if there was anyone else out there who, like me, has decided *not* to kill oneself—essentially, to continue living—despite the persistence of suicidal thoughts/feelings/ideations/wishes.**

I will not kill myself.

But some days, I really don't want to be alive anymore."
"Suicidal people don’t want to die, they just want the pain to stop.","I hate this quote. I want to die. No one can tell me about my own feelings because I live through my own personal hell every single day. 
Edit. I’d meant that I hate this quote. I am not saying this to any of you all. I am not invalidating your experience or telling you you feel a certain way."
Has anyone been suicidal for so long but don’t have the courage to end it so you end up isolating yourself from everyone so people forget you eventually?,"I’ve cut off my friends for over a year now, but they weren’t really friends, just people I knew in all honesty. I never was able to develop a true friendship in high school due to my reoccurring depression and generalized anxiety. But now, I have no one and it’s mostly caused by my own actions due to deleting all social medias, avoiding social interaction at school and talking to no one. When you’ve given up on life a long time ago, you don’t care if you have friends, so I’ve been isolating myself until noone remembers me. Eventually, I will have the courage to kill myself and when I do, noone will remember if I was even here."
I hate how your brain teases you with random moments of motivation/hope/joy/etc. then plunges you back into feeling like subhuman trash for days or weeks on end,"I feel like I have nothing worth living for, my music sucks ass, which is the only thing I care about. I'm very grateful my parents care about me but I feel like this isn't getting better no matter how much I've tried. My therapist appointment is so far away even though its only thursday. I've tried holding on, but for some reason it just gets worse.

edit: dumbass spelling error"
People try to talk you out of suicide instead of talking you into life,"That's the pattern every time. Someone will try and explain why I shouldn't just kill myself but they never give me any good reasons why living is preferable to me dying.

Death is a perament solution to a temporary problem? No other solution is permanent, anything could go wrong at any time, suicide is a permanent solution to all my problems and is therefore the best one I have."
My sister committed suicide last night.,"The pain is so heavy in my heart right now. This whole time I thought i was alone, when my sister was feeling the exact same way i am right now. She was only 27. She lives four hours away so we are going to her house now. It’s currently 4:11am in new zealand and all i want to do is cry. We have different dads and we don’t really look a like at all but she was always my number one supporter. She was always there for me and always babysat me when i was little. I have a scar on my pinky from the day she jammed my finger in the door lol. We have so many photos together. She always used to come over for christmas and for my birthdays. I can’t even type right now i’m in so much pain. I still can’t and don’t want to believe this. Someone I knew so well gone just like that."
The hardest part of being suicidal,"The hardest part of being suicidal? At least for me (19 F), it's looking into the eyes of someone who loves you unconditionally and telling them that you're fine when you're having suicidal thoughts. 

My dad is everything to me. He is the most innocent and caring man I have ever encountered. He has tolerated all my rage attacks, crying episodes, tantrums, and has spoiled and loved me ever since the day I was born. I suffer from bipolar 2 and have been going through a severe depressive episode which usually happens around the same time every year. This year I know exactly what's happening and I want to try my best to get past these thoughts. If not for me, for my dad. I have not known real pain until I saw his eyes water today when he saw me crying. He knows me and what I go through. That hurts me the most."
"They'll let you be homeless but tell you suicide is ""never the answer""..","Honestly, this is one of the most puzzling things about society. People tell you that ""we don't live in a vaccum. everyone has people who care"" along with other shamings of suicide calling you ""cowardly"".

But when you want to live...oh no. You're entitled to nothing. If you don't do well in school your parents kick you out and you end up homeless liviing on a cardboard box. 

But remember, don't kill yourself because ""people care about you so much""

I understand having to work to participate in society but I find it so stupid that people can't see the incongruity. I can't honestly imagine telling a homeless person freezing in the cold ""keep struggling because life is worth it"". If they want to die, then let them die and vice versa."
Reminder: NO ACTIVISM is allowed here at any time.,"We know that September 10 was World Suicide Prevention Day.  And, we're all for activism.   But not here, please and thank you.  It takes focus away from our OPs in need of support and understanding.  "
I'm a pedophile and I think I'm ready to kill myself,"I've never had a normal sex drive and I thought I was asexual for a while, but I guess the reality is more insidious. I've struggled with Pure O OCD ever since I was a child, and at first I thought this was it. I've always worried about hurting people. My sexuality has been an topic of anxiety since grade school, since I have been borderline asexual my whole life. Late high school was when it began, although I was never able to accept it then. It hit like a truck last summer where I had multiple panic attacks due to these thoughts that put me in a mental hospital. I hoped the drugs they gave me would help end the fetish, but they only helped the anxiety and depression. It has been getting steadily worse ever since. Most therapists understandably don't want to see me. Yesterday I masturbated to an anime child (thankfully I have never looked up illegal images). I think at this point it hit what I had become and I lost hope for redemption. I am a ticking time bomb before I ruin someones life. And I can't live with myself like this. I can never have a SO, or a family. Even having friends feels wrong. It's going to be be hard as I actually enjoy my life quite a bit. But I feel like this is the only responsible and logical thing to do. End it now while I'm still me, before this takes over. From now on I plan to stop taking my meds, as the mood swings will help me get this done. Then end by exit bag or hanging while listening to Avril 14th. I am tired of the self pity and ready to take responsibility. Wish me the luck and courage to end this. Thank you.
Edit: Still here. Going to look into some more mental or physical health options before making a decision I think. Thank you for your kindness even if I don't understand it."
Nobody talks about the after attempt,"I tried to kill myself. I overdosed heavily on a cocktail of pills and medicines. The advice i have? Don't. Nobody talks about the aftermath of when somebody saves your life. The people who know you are torn apart by grief even though you survived. And you get to see it. And you also get to see everybody talk to you as if on eggshells, treat you like you're a kicked puppy.  And the guilt is worse than that before. Because you caused that and they won't admit it to you. The guilt is soul destroying. And then there's you. Your stomach can't handle anything but water and plain bread. The sharp stabbing pains and rises of nausea that knock you off your feet. The shaking for no reason- entire body failing to function correctly at any given moment. Sleep? No. You will wake up routinely every hour or so. And that's if you can fall asleep after fighting your guilt over trying and the physical pain its caused on top of what made you try in the first place. Oh. And when you finally think your body has recovered? Its worse. You cant go out without being drained and you have literally liquid shit. Like youre peeing out of your ass. Water can even make you feel sick. 

Okay sure. You wanna die. But a lot don't succeed. And the failure is grim. I have liver damage, my stomach linings are non existent. I'm suffering more than before and i could never try again because of who i affected and the damage i've done.

Edit: it's been 3 weeks. I have to take medication for my stomach otherwise the pain is horrible and i am still just shitting and vomiting stomach acid"
I just realised that people don't really care about my mental health. They just care that I'm not a whining bitch anymore.,"Ive learned how to supress my emotions. No more crying. No more screaming at the top of my lungs when I'm in pain. No more hitting myself when I'm angry. No more panic attacks in front of others. I'm still in just as much hurt as I was before, now I just know nobody wants to deal with my bullshit. 

And you know what? Fair. Not even I wanna deal with my bullshit. But at least don't act like you do care when you don't. Nobody tried to help me solve my problems. They pretended they did. All they did was get me to a point where my problems were no longer anyone else's problems and called that me ""getting better."" Despite the fact that I am very visibily just as equally as bad as I was before. 

I swear this is just even more proof I'm seriously just a burden. My silence has seemed to drastically improve the lives of those around me. So imagine what literally just not existing could do."
My Mom showed off my suicide letter like it was a fashion statement,"So basically i tried to do it a couple of months ago, had everything prepared, was ready to just end it all. Until all of a sudden i got way too scared and decided to call it off

My mom saw the letter that i was supposed to leave and went behind my back showed it off to her friends and some family members then talked to me about it,

I became  some sort of beacon of attention which i hated people telling me that ""it'll get better"" or saying if it was true Sometimes i kinda wished i wasnt such a pussy and ended it right then and there, couldve saved myself from embarrasment"
"If you make enough suicide attempts, people stop caring.","That’s what I feel has happened to me. It’s like I don’t have the right to say “I’m sad” anymore because I either get ignored or eye rolls. 

I’ve come up with a pretty fool-proof way to strangle myself while I am unconscious, and I have decided to have another go at trying to die (this is my fifth attempt, my first I put a gun to head and chickened out, second I stranded myself in the wilderness, third I tried to mix pills, and fourth I basically drank poison).

I didn’t think it mattered, being supported. 

Maybe it’s seeing friends cut me out of their lives one by one. Maybe it’s family looking annoyed and just saying “I’m sorry you feel like this.” Maybe it’s my marriage partner flat-out saying nothing when I tell him I want to die. Maybe it’s my mental condition that causes me constant grief and pain, then shoots me up to mania so I feel like I have no control of my life. Maybe it’s because I’m spending my life savings just sitting at home jobless, I don’t contribute to society, I should be allowed to be euthanized. 

Thanks for listening like usual r/suicidewatch, I appreciate it, no one else wants to. Though you have my gratitude, I hope I never post here again, because I will finally be successful."
I’m more afraid to live another 60 years than dying.,Does anyone else feel this way?
"The logistics of killing yourself are so endlessly, frustratingly complicated","I would literally attempt suicide right now if I thought it would work, but I just feel like I would just end up with permanent damage and be accused of being an attention seeker, when in reality, I just want to die quietly without any fuss. 

I hate hearing stuff like, *""if you fail, it's just a parasuicidal gesture""* and *""there are lots of ways to make sure it works,""* because sure-fire suicide methods are obviously not readily available to the vast majority of people. 

* Do I try to poison myself with household products and probably just end up screwing up my organs?
* Do I try to hang myself and risk brain damage? 
* Do I jump off a tall building and freak out a bunch of people who don't deserve it?
* Do I kill myself in the bath/pool and make everyone else feel weird about using it afterwards?
* Do I lie to get a prescription I don't actually need and potentially get someone in trouble?
* Do I gas myself and put others in harm's way?
* If I write a note, would that comfort people, or would it just make them feel like they could've ""done something"" and make it worse?
* Should I ghost my friends before I do it to minimise the casualties? 
* Is it better for my family/friends to find me, or some rando?
* What place/time would be best to prevent me from being interrupted?
* Should I endure the pain and wait until I'm a bit older to kill myself so that I'm not seen as some immature, self-centred kid and people in my life don't blame themselves?
* If I survive, do I lie and say it was impulsive, and not like, years in the making?
* Should I delete my SNS pages and all the messages that I can before doing it?
* Should I try between semesters in case I fail and need to take a break because I've messed up my health?
* Would me killing myself destroy my religious extended family? 
* Should I quit my job beforehand, or do I keep it just in case I survive?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'm going to do it, but I don't want to before I have a proper plan in place. Partly to minimise the damage, but mostly because I'm just so very worried about the consequences of potentially screwing up. I don't even question whether or not this is what I really want anymore, it's just a matter or how and when. 

I wish this self-righteous society didn't censor 99% of helpful information that'll actually let me die instead of end up sick and injured. I wish I didn't have to feel guilty or selfish for wanting this. I wish people would stop spewing their spiritual and philosophical ideologies at me when they have f\*ck all to do with my personal situation. I wish people would admit that it's possible and even sometimes reasonable to want to kill yourself but not be depressed. I wish people would stop changing their tune about whether or not this will get better or worse with age when it's convenient for them. I wish it wasn't so hard and so morally taboo and so painful and so contentious and so risky to choose what I do with my own freaking life that I never even wanted in the first place."
Wife cheated update,"Edit: So I've been getting a lot of DM's asking how I caught her etc and what I did. So I came back from a late night jog as I find it peaceful and relaxing as the streets are empty, I came back home to have a shower of course as I was sweaty as fuck. I entered the apartment and just headed to the bedroom and there is where I saw her with another man in bed. My god damn silk sheets tainted by them 😔😂, but yeah it's weird cause I thought I would lash out but I was unusually calm about it. I told the guy to leave and he was literally shitting himself and scrambling to pick up his belongings, like this guy is literally tripping everywhere. 

I think he was afraid as I was just very calm and he didn't expect it. Anyway I spoke to my wife asking how long it's been happening and she told me who he is etc, it's a childhood ""friend"". After that I went to the train station which is where the first post came in.

Edit 2: People are also asking how long we were together. So I met my loyal and faithful wife at 14 and we got married at 20. So in total that's 12 years of faithfulness from the amazing wife. 

Edit 3: Holy shit whoever gave the platinum thanks so much???

Edit 4: People are surprised that I'm over this so quick and I'm calm about it, I guess it's down to the fact I live by the rule that is ""the pains compulsory, sufferings optional""

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gt620f/wife_cheated/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So it's been about 10hours since I posted this and honestly thank you so much everyone for all the support and comments. 

I'm not going to lie when I posted the previous post I was at the train station just waiting to jump infront of one but as stupid as it sounds the comments honestly helped. 

I've now kicked my wife out of our apartment and the bed that she was sleeping with the guy in, I have now burnt. Which kinda sucks as it was a king sized bed with silk sheets and everything but I wouldn't have even been able to sleep in those cheat stained sheets now no matter how much I scrub them. 

It felt good tho to actually burn it cause it was letting things go, I've cleared out all the things that reminded me off her and basically smashed it up so kinda like smash therapy and it felt amazing. 

Her parents know that she cheated on me cause she tried to spin it that I cheated on her however we have cameras in our apartment and I just sent them the videos 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Now her family has pretty much disowned her which I feel like it may be a bit too much even though she is a shitty person but honestly I couldn't care less.

I'm free, feeling a bit shit but I know I'll be happier and honestly if it wasn't for you guys I probably wouldn't be here. 

Thank you so much everyone, especially the dude that was talking about pasta 😂"
We need some support over at r/Teenagers.,"Today, that sub has seen an unnatural spike in suicide notes, and one of them seems to have actually gone through with it. None of us over there have any way of confidently trying to talk these people out of their actions, so I would greatly appreciate it if some of you kept an eye out for any more suicidal teens that appear and help us in our endeavor to prevent any more deaths."
A letter to a friend who'll never read it.,"I saw you today. 

Things were good, better than good. You were smiling that idiotic smile that I love. Wearing that old and faded track pants that I begged you to throw away but you never did. Then you saw me. Your face lit up. You came towards me, held my hands and said the silliest, stupidest joke that I ever heard. You know I don't like jokes but you still make me laugh. How do you do that??

We were together after such a long time. Me nagging you, you making me laugh, falling in love all over again. It was just like old times. 

I saw you today. But then I woke up.

I wanted to hold on to you, to be with you and never let you go again, to go back into the dream where you were. But I couldn't. The harder I tried the farther you felt. 

Realization hit; I'd never see you again, I'd never talk to you, nag you, hold you, be held by you, give you the cherry on top of my ice-creams because I still don't like them. 

I hate you.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

I hate you because you never loved me enough. I hate you because you never trusted me enough. And I hate you because you were in pain and you never bothered to share it with me.

Everytime I needed you, you were there. You never complained about the time. You let me cry, shout, rage when I was in pain. You helped me so much. But you never told that you were in pain. Why?? Why didn't you??

Did you not think that I'd do everything to comfort you. I may not have been able to take away your pain, but I would've held your hand through it. 

I hate you. and I'll always hate you. Because I love you. and I'll always love you. 

No one can take your place. You were entirely special. All that sickening positivity and patience. Was it all a lie then? A mask? A cover-up for your feelings?

I'm sorry I failed you. I should've looked deeper. Should've been a better friend. May be if I didn't rely on you so much, you would've been comfortable to rely on me. Is that why you couldn't even say goodbye?

I hate you and I'll always will. And someday I'm going to die as well. It may be now or eighty years from now or anytime in between. I'm going to die and then I'm going to find you in the afterlife. And I'd hit you and kick you and scratch you and strangle you and God knows what else. But I'll never let you go then. I'll always, always be with you. 

Till then, I'll hold you in my heart and dreams and memories.

I'll always love you, you perv."
"Does anyone else just feel like disappearing socially? Nuking social media, cutting ties to your family & friends, etc?","I am so beyond tired of waking up day in and day out to these negative and intrusive feelings and thoughts being played on repeat in my head. It's to the point where I've been giving more and more thought to just ""disappearing"" from people's lives. Not even saying goodbye -- just disappearing. Obliterating every real connection that I have so I can slip further and further into solitude. Maybe I just want to make it easier for when I finally decide to off myself. I don't know. 

What I do know is that everything feels so... pointless. I can't stop feeling numb and empty. 

I just want to sever all my ties and connections so I can be alone. So I can self-destruct alone.

I can't even remember a time where I felt OK. I don't think I'll ever feel OK again. And it's not ok to feel this way. No one should ever, ever have to feel this way. Ever. 

But yet, some of us do. And it fucking sucks. I wish I could just absorb all the bad feelings everyone in the world has and just take them with me to the grave."
please read my letter so i can be remembered by someone,"i just want someone to know about me before i go.  read if you want.  thanks if you do.

I will have to take at least three semesters at my new school to finish my bachelor’s degree.  This new school is shitty and not a good school but it’s the only one I could get in to.  I was supposed to graduate next month but since my parents refused to sign a loan for my last semester I had to drop out of the really good school I was going to.  Now since I’ll have to take so many semesters to finish the costs will balance out anyway and so now I’m wasting more time and the same amount of money for a shittier degree.  I don’t want to graduate when I’m 24, I wanted to graduate at 21 like I was supposed to and not waste 6+ years of my life in college.  I don’t even want to be doing what I’m majoring in.  I already owe 150k in loans that I’ll never pay off.  I’m going to be stuck in a shitty job (if I can even find a job after all this corona shit) for the rest of my life.  I don’t see myself being able to move out of my mom’s house before I graduate since I can’t get a high enough paying job without a degree.  I cannot stay here in the middle of fucking nowhere in this abusive household for 2 more years.  My dreams of going to Korea are over because I won’t be able to find a high enough paying job there to afford living and my school loan payments.  I envisioned myself living in Korea/NYC by the time I graduated which was supposed to be in two months; now I might have to wait two more years.  I cannot wait that long.  And the only thing I wanted to do, which was pursue my love of music/singing/making Youtube videos, is not an option because of how much I'll have to work to pay off the loans; how my family doesn't let me record shit in the house because I'm ""too loud"" even though they're always screaming at each other; how I'm not even a good enough singer to do anything and I'm not in a financial position or location to get lessons/learn from anyone.

&#x200B;

I've already been through sexual assault, an abusive relationship, and abusive family in college, on top of depression and anxiety and PTSD from the assault.  My whole childhood was full of abusive and terrifying memories.  I can even recall my father telling me that if I wanted to kill myself so badly as a thirteen year old that I should just do it, but do it outside of the house so he doesn't have to clean it up.  I can't hold on anymore.  Life was supposed to be better after I graduated, I was supposed to leave.  I can't sit around for another two years and be treated without any respect."
I told my parents I’m going to kill myself and they just wished me the best,"As I was walking out of the door my mum said she hopes that’ll now make me happy. 

Nobody tried to stop me or check if I would be okay.

I’ve told them I feel suicidal about 3 times before, and they’ve pretty much brushed it off like it’s just attention seeking.

Now idk about you but I think that’s pretty fcuked up. 

Of course your child is seeking attention they want to fcuking die because they cannot take life anymore. 

I’m just so sick of everything. I feel like I have no one I can turn to. 

My ex left me, I have no real friends and now my family have turned their back on me.

I just can’t take this anymore."
My friend has killed himself,"There was a guy I met in this sub, a really good guy. I followed many of his posts, and didn't speak to him, till I saw his last post in which he described how he felt and announced how he is gonna take his own life.

 It's really disheartening how our own mind plays tricks with us to the point where we will lose all our hope, dreams and joy in life. How it puts us in a loop where everything seems dull and empty.

This guy was a legend. He tried his best, but still unable to find strenght to carry on. I believe this is the worst way to go. 

I wish I said something more, I wish i knew better. 
Now there is nothing anyone can do. He left thinking worst of himself, feeling worthless after many years of struggle. 

Please dont mind if its written poorly, I had to get this off my chest.

Thanks"
Anyone else going to miss the part of them that could have been so great?,"The real part of yourself. The part that had dreams and ambitions. The part that dreamt of meeting someone you could fall in love with. The part that used to get comfort from things so simple such as showering, sleeping and eating your favourite foods. Maybe movies, tv shows or sports that made you feel alive and hopeful. The innocent part, now buried by the pain inflicted by your mind. This is not a post of optimism, more just typing what floats in my complex mind.

I think we all knew the potential we once had, and could not imagine things to flip so unfairly. Some recover, others don’t. Others endure the pain knowing they can never break free but accepting it. Some can’t end their lives due to the pain, others can more easily. 
I used to think I wouldn’t miss living if I died. 

But I don’t think that’s true. I would miss the part of me buried deep within. Not the part swarmed by all these mental illnesses, but the part of me that was inclusive, kind and dreamy. Realism is a terrible thing for people suffering, with no indication of improvement. And the way hope plays on your mind and pulls you back, can be a terrible thing too. Do not let hope control your life. Personally, no matter how comforting hope can be, it has a harmful agenda in the long run. What if the hoping never ends."
I wish there was a reset button for life,I really need one
Do you ever feel like suicide is your destiny?,"I mean, for me at least, it's like there's no way around it. Things get better, my life improves in ways that I didn't think possible, but at the back of my mind I still have offing myself as an option.  It's always like: ""Let's see where this goes. If it all goes to shit, I can still end my life"".

Since the moment that I first contemplated suicide, it seems inevitable. Like I'm just waiting for a bad turn."
"“You’re not alone.” Yes, the fuck I am.","It’s me vs world, it’s always been me vs the world and no matter how many times random ass people post shit on like instagram about how “You’re not alone!” “You’re gonna be okay!” it will never be true. I am alone and I will make the decision to eat lead alone, I will die and rot alone just as a lived because that’s the sad reality for some people. Some people have people, some do not and that’s just how it is."
I’m sick and tired of nobody giving a fuck about how you feel unless you’re cutting yourself or want to kill yourself.,"Does anybody understand how incredibly selfish that is?? “Don’t do it there’s so much to live for” like what your sorry ass who doesn’t want me gone so that you’re not sad? Guess fucking what I don’t fucking care if you’re that selfish you deserve to be just as sad as I am. I’ve been suffering all my life and you don’t give a fuck but the SECOND I say I’m gonna kill myself NOW it matters. But if I shut up about wanting to die and just express about how hurt I am you have better things to do you don’t fucking care nobody fucking cares. “Don’t talk to me about suicide it makes me uncomfortable” oh so sorry need me to paint your nails too princess??

And like cutting doesn’t even give me any sort of nice relief it doesn’t do anything for me. Wanna know why I do it? To express how fucking bad I’m hurting because nobody gives a shit unless you cut yourself. People can be suffering WORSE and not cut themselves because it doesn’t do anything for them. Nobody fucking cares nobody fucking cares nobody fucking cares and I’m so sick and tired of it"
I hate people who say suicidal people are selfish.,"This life is my own and mine alone. Do not tell me what to do with it. I am not going to keep living in pain and misery, just so the people around me don't feel sad. I'm sorry, it's possible that some people will be heavily affected by my death, but I don't care enough to keep going. 

Fuck you \[person\] for telling me that suicidal people are selfish and are sinners. Fuck you to hell and back."
Ive attempted suicide and my goodbye letter was shown to everyone,"Hey.. so just like it says in the title, ive attempted suicide but failed obviously.
Well i was in a coma for a few days and i wrote a letter for my little sister to explain to her why i did what i did.
Little did i know, that letter would be read by everyone! And i mean everyone. I woke up and a therapist was beside me and the first thing she said was that she read my letter. I was so shocked and couldnt say anything for 3 seconds or more. Apparently she thought i didnt believed her so she just quoted the most disturbing and private part of it to me. My mother and all the people in the hospital read it too. 
I had to get into a clinic for one month and no surprise they all knew what i wrote in it.. i felt so shitty because these was personal stuff i didnt want to share with other people!!!"
Do you feel like a useless NPC ?,"Like a joke character , no one interacts with and always 
alone no one gives a fuck about him ."
quarantine would be heaven if i lived alone,my family just makes me hate myself even more
The worst feeling in the world is when you don't want to be alive but you're too big of a pussy to do it because you feel obligated to stay for other people's well-being,"I don't know why they'd even miss me. Even want me around. I destroy everything I touch, in a way. I'm not cut out for this ""life"" thing."
Anybody else wishing that they could run away instead of killing themselves?,"I wish I had some money saved away and a car, I wish I could drive away and never come back to my life. 

I always wish for a simple life, I always dream i’m driving to Uruguay and that i’m changing my name to Hermano or whatever the fuck, I’d teach kids to swim and spend my days getting stoned by myself. I’d volunteer at a soup kitchen and write my books at night.

But that never happens, i’m completely by myself and in a relationship where i’m most likely being used. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I just want to be better."
"Anyone ever lie in bed at night and think to yourself, “I could end it all right now with this (knife, gun, pills, etc)?”","I’ve come quite close to trying it, but I don’t have the courage to do so."
"""it gets better"" is just bullshit that people say to make you feel better when they don't know what to say.","It doesn't get better. When it gets better, it gets even worse afterwards. Nothing good lasts forever. The bad wouldn't be bad without the good and vice versa. But the bad is just so, so fucking bad. I'm driven one step closer to suicide each time it gets bad, and my expectations on how bad it can get are subverted every time."
I’ve become the person I always feared of being,"Underachiever, socially inept, unlikeable, unwanted, unmotivated, directionless and unlikely to ever leave home/my hometown"
Just please read it would mean a lot to me. I’m so alone.,"2016
It’s close to midnight. It’s dark and cold. My door is closed. As I lay about to fall asleep I hear something. I’m half awake half asleep so I don’t really acknowledge it. I turn on my right side and try to fall asleep again. But then I hear something. I open my eyes too scared to turn back over to see what it is. It sounded like someone was crawling beside my bed. Here I lay, trying to figure out what it is. Then I hear a very loud “hey!” Yelled right in my ear. I instantly sit up and look around my room but of course I see nothing. I must just be paranoid.

It was a few months after my mom married him. I never really liked him. When he did what he did, I was too young to understand what it meant. He’d put me on his lap, grab my sides and butt when my mother was working. He called me his “favorite”. It was just touching then. How I wish it never had to be more. 
~••••••~
2007
We had just got back from a family party the first time it happened. It was really late at night and my mother went to sleep as soon as we got home I remember being half awake as she told him to carry me to bed as I was already sleeping from the car ride home. Their room was upstairs mine was in the basement. As he put me to bed he started touching me. By then I was awake. He was on top of me and told me to be quiet as he held his hand over my mouth. I remember crying and looking out my bedroom window counting in my head thinking of when it was going to be over. I was in so much pain. When he was done, he told me again how I was his favorite. I couldn’t do anything but cry. The next morning my mom was already gone at work and there I was, stuck in a house with a monster. 
~••••••~
2013
It was going on for a few years now. Yes, I did want and try to tell my mom about it, but I was so scared she wouldn’t love me anymore and would blame me for it happening so I never did, because he said if I told, she wouldn’t want me anymore. In school my grades dropped, my attendance dropped, and I’d never pay attention. I felt so alone and so scared. Yes, I did self harm as I felt that the pain of that would not hurt as much as the pain from him. I did run away, and when my councilor found out, I talked to her, I told her an excuse saying I didn’t wanna go home because I hated when he yelled, I couldn’t tell her the real reason was because of what he did to me almost every night. I couldn’t tell her as much as I wanted to. I felt so isolated. She called him and he had picked me up from school, when we got home he immediately did what he did to me almost every night and said I deserved it for being bad. My mom was always out working as she worked two jobs and would really only be home 7am-12pm.

2015 
A few years later and it was still happening. I was sick every morning and when I told my friends about it they joked around saying I was pregnant. I laughed along but in my head I thought, “could I really be?”. I remember stealing a pregnancy test from a pharmacy and took it as soon as I got home. It was positive. I felt sick, then and there I wanted to throw up, no not from being pregnant but from being pregnant from him, my step father. I just wanted to die. I remember a few days going by as my mom cleaned my room she found the test. She yelled at me for not being careful and was yelling at me for becoming pregnant at such a young age. Little did she know, the father was the man she married, the man that has been sexually abusing me for years, my step father. I miscarried at 10 weeks, as bad as it may sound, I was glad I did.

2016
My mom had finally divorced the piece of shit after she found out he was cheating and I had so much relief after that. I thought finally no more pain. Later that year, I was constantly getting in trouble, doing drugs, trying to be cool hanging with the “bad kids”. I was expelled mid freshman year. I started going to an alternative school for kids who got expelled from high schools. There I met a friend I’ve known since kindergarten. We started hanging out everyday after school. I thought to myself that wow someone is actually being nice to me. There was this Friday where I was hanging out with a different friend when I ran into him and his friends. We decided to all hang out and we went in an ally way to drink and he had given me some pills saying it would get me “high”. Being the uncaring trying to fit in cool kid I took them and drank. My friend I was with had left with some dude that he was hanging with. So it was just me him and his other friend. We decided to go chill in a stairwell. I was so gone off whatever I had taken and from all the drinking I did. I remember him asking to have sex and I said no. I passed out and next thing I knew he was on top of me as his friend watched. I quickly pushed him off put my pants back on and as I ran down the stairway crying I seen him and his friend high five. I called my sister for a ride home but didn’t tell her what happen. When I got home I started crying to my mom but all she did was yell at me for coming home late and didn’t even ask me why I was crying. I went in my room wondering how could he do that to me? Someone I knew since elementary school. How could this happen. As I laid in bed, I thought to myself that I was nothing. I was already being sexually abused from my step dad for years and now it happens again at age 16 from someone I called a friend. By then, all I wanted to do was die. I thought after that monster was out of my life I’d be a little okay, yet it happened again from someone I knew and considered a friend. 
~••••••~
2018
I am 18 and I try to drink every weekend I can with older friends. Because I didn’t want to be sober on weekends when I was by myself I didn’t want to be alone with my thoughts. Because on weekdays I’d be occupied by work. So weekends I’d just drink every chance I could. It was not good. Everywhere I went to drink, there was always one dude touching me and pushing his self on me. I thought to myself wow I really can’t get away from this stuff. All my life I’ve endured so much pain from people I thought were supposed to protect me. Sure I drank and maybe you think it’s my fault for putting myself in such a situation like this. I couldn’t get away from it. I thought to myself the best way out of this hell of a loop is taking myself out. I’ve attempted suicide 3 times the past year. Soon it will be my time to go, because all I feel is pain and loneliness. I’m so scarred and paranoid from the things my step father did that every night I have to sleep with ear plugs in and a blanket over my face because I’m scared that he will be standing next to me even though I know he’s gone. 


Not the place to post, but at the time, I just needed it out of my mind. And yes, cops were eventually involved for everyone asking. "
No one gives a shit until you admit you want to die,Nobody gives a fuck how much pain you're in or how much you're suffering until you admit that you want to die. If you didn't give a fuck before don't pretend to now. Instead of locking me up like some kind of rabid animal just give me some sodium pentobarbital so I can fucking die.
No one cares until you're about to kill yourself,"It's funny how no one says anything until you're about to kill yourself. It doesn't matter how much you're suffering, you are a selfish bastard if you kill yourself, you should think of your friends and family and everyone who will miss you. Well, these people don't care if I'm suffering or not as long, as they don't have to notice or think about it. 

How long am I supposed to keep it all pent up inside? It's so fucking tiring."
I hate that I can’t kill myself,"I just want to disappear. I don’t want to die, I want to stop existing. Dying involves violently ending your life. And leaping into the void of death, not knowing what exactly will happen. I just want to stop existing and to be forgotten.

I’m stuck and I hate it so much."
Do y’all’s ever want to kill yourself over a minor inconvenience and that makes you want to kill yourself even more cause other people have it way worse?,"Like, I’m reading posts on this sub where people’s siblings/loved ones have killed themselves and they want to follow, that one guy was a pedophile, people are extremely lonely/ugly/poor/abused, and it’s just an overall Shit show.

I dropped like 5 dishes at work today and that was enough to almost make me go over the edge. There are literally slaves that have known nothing but agony their entire lives in this world and I’m just your average clumsy 18 year old who, in the grand scheme of things, has nothing to be worried about. Fuck."
"Just graduated from college today, planning on taking my life tonight.","Like the title says, today I received my bachelors in medical lab science and have every intention of taking my life tonight. I am not sure why I am making this post, maybe its a cry for help or just a way to make me feel like at least one person knows why I took my life on a day I was supposed to be happy.

Here's my story for anyone who cares to hear it. I grew up in a household with a very verbally and occasionally physically abusive father and a mother who could do very little to stop what was happening considering she was just as much a victim as I was. I also have a younger brother who my father favors and can do no wrong. Growing up, I would get yelled at for the smallest things and had to be careful whenever I did anything whilst my brother was apparently special and needed his space so he could do whatever he wanted. He didn't have anything wrong with him, like a mental/physical disability, he just was allowed to live how he wanted while I took the blame. He ended up dropping out of school first year of high school and working with my father in construction while I went on to college.

Where I live, the minimum wage is far below what is the minimum you need to live. This meant that even working a job while going to college, I had no choice but to live at home. My family problems became less of an impact when I simply locked myself in my room the moment I got home. It was normal for me to never speak to or even look one of my family members in the eye for weeks to months at a time. That being said, it comes to no surprise that nobody in my family attended graduation. They probably didn't even realize I had graduated at all.

Life at school wasn't any better for me. I was overweight and not exactly the most attractive person so I was more or less left alone save for a few bullies here and there. I never really had any real life friends and it became customary for me to find a quiet spot away from everyone and eat alone during lunch and attend my classes quietly. Even if I wanted to talk to others, I found that incredibly difficult because of severe social anxiety. So I just went class to class, graduated high school, did the same in college. Never having friends never really bothered me probably because I don't know what having a real life friend is even like in the first place.

The only part of my life I would have considered to be somewhat decent or even normal would have been when I logged into WoW. I was about 13 or 14 when I first started playing and that was the only time I ever found a place I felt like I belonged. I eventually got used to getting know know people through them talking to each other over ventrilo (I very rarely spoke and never on coms) and I felt like I belonged even if i was just some quiet kid on the side. Eventually what I would consider to be the highlight of my life going forward would have been when I became very close with someone I met in my current guild. We were both 15 and became very close and eventually became a couple. We were together for 7 years and helped each other finish high school and get into college. Because of circumstances, we never ended up meeting in real life over those 7 years, mostly due to her mother being extremely over protective. Despite that we spoke and played many video games together over those years. Neither of us had real life friends, but that never mattered because it was us against the world.

It was 2017 when she left me without a word or reason. She had been depressed (not eating, staying home from class, ect.) for about 3 or 4 months prior and I did everything I could to try to lighten her day best I could but it seems that nothing worked. This was all very stressful for me and I am sure I might have said somethings out of frustration from time to time, but all I ever did was try to help. I was trying to plan a trip to visit her, but that wasn't easy considering we lived of opposite sides of the US. Before I was able to finish planning out the trip she suddenly blocked me on everything and I never heard from her ever again.

The following two years were a living hell for me. I had been accepted into the medical laboratory science program at my college just one month prior to her disappearing. The whole reason I pursued that degree and career was so that I could easily find a fairly high paying job anywhere in the country because of the high demand for medical lab techs. The plan was to graduate and find a job immediately in her state and move there to be with her. However she was gone now, I was still accepted to the program, and had nothing else in my life so I just kept going with the program. Flash forward to today, I've now graduated and even have a job in my field already (note new hire wage doesn't even pay enough to live on your own in this state) but I feel completely empty. The whole speech about how we will go forward into our careers didn't even feel directed towards me, and all the congratulations felt wasted on me.

I know I planned my entire life around someone who I've never met in person and I am fully aware how stupid that is. Honestly I expected things to work out better considering we had been happy together for a 3rd of my life up to that point, but regardless of that I know how dumb I am. My entire life has been a joke and even the biggest accomplishment of most peoples lives today, for me, was just a joke set up by another joke.

This is why I have every intention of ending my life tonight. I have no family that will care enough if I am gone, no friends that will miss me, i'm sure my boss won't be happy that I am gone but I was only still a trainee anyways so losing me won't affect anyone's schedules, and my position will be filled by my classmate who deserves the job more than I do anyways.

Sorry for this being so long (23 years is hard to condense but I did my best), maybe didn't make any sense at times, and I am not sure this is even the right place to post considering I've never posted on reddit before so if it gets removed that's okay. Maybe at least one stranger will read this and know why I died since I don't plan to leave a suicide or anything of the like so I guess this will be it. Thank you to whoever reads this for taking the time to learn about me and maybe even care that I died.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kindness, it really does mean a lot to me. I struggle a lot when it comes to talking to people and I find it hard to reply to comments but just know that I am reading them and can't thank all of you who have shared your stories enough. I'm going to keep fighting today and try to get through today best I can."
Do you guys ever feel so horribly alone even when you're around close friends or family?,"I feel like nobody gets it, life feels so fake and plasticy. How does everybody do this day in day out?? It's been one tragedy after another for my whole life, out of 18 years only 6 months felt real and happy. I cling to that time in memory hoping I get to relive it. I took such advantage of it.

The only enjoyment I get out of life is talking to my crush and my dad. I want to see them happy. They're the only important things to me.

Is making others happy really all I exist for? I want to die so badly but it would hurt them. I hate it I wish they hated me so I could have an excuse. Thanks for reading my idiotic rambling. <3 you guys too."
I hate living in this world. Everything is about money and I’m sick of it.,I don’t want to sound ungrateful or like I’m complaining. But I’m really fed up with living in this world everything is so expensive I’m so miserable. I feel like for the rest of my life I’ll be slaving for some green paper till I’m dead and gone. I’m tired of paying bills and I’m tired of living here. People keep saying that this is a free country and you can achieve anything that you want to. But how can you when everything is so hard. Nothing is free here everything has a price tag. Everything is not easy they make life a living hell. I feel so trapped I’m tired of it I want out. The crazy thing is we cannot take none of this with us so why is it so much pressure and stress on us to make money. I understand this is the way the world was formed but it’s honestly draining.
I tried to kill myself Friday,I took as many pills as I could and washed them down with whiskey. Then I took a razor blade to my arm and cut it up until my arm and my basement was covered in blood. My parents found me and now I am at their house while they try to get me help. I survived and now I’m looking ahead to the future. I must’ve survived for a reason. It’s going to be hard but I need to at least give this a chance. I hope all of you do as well. Take care.
Why do people who DONT want to die die?,"Like why the fuck is the universe giving cancer to some father of 4 who has an amazing life and wants to live, while I’ve tried to kill myself 17 times in the past week

give ME cancer you fucking prick, take it from someone else and give it to me i actually want  fucks sake

EDIT: 18 hanging myself rn. hope i die. losing consciounes. love u

EDIT2: sadly i survived.

EDIT3: the belt is looking kinda good again"
Why does everyone think therapy is some miracle cure???,"CBT is literally a psychologist or psychiatrist or therapist or fucking whatever telling you things you already damn know and don’t have the motivation or energy to execute. “Think positive”, “focus on breathing”, “exercise”, “find time to do things you enjoy”. I could pull this shit out of my ass. I fucking hate it when people tell me to “get help”. There is no fucking help. Only I can help myself, and I can’t.


Edit: The comments saying you only get what you put in, I’m done, I have nothing to put in. That’s KINDA what depression does"
"Sleeping is so peaceful, I hate waking up.","When I am sleeping, nothing around me exists. No duties, no burdens, no depression nothing. I can just live. Even dreamless sleeps, where there is nothing but darkness feels so comfortable. I can just close my eyes and leave this world for some moments. 

I am so tired. So tired of everything. They always say ""there's light at the end of the tunnel"" but I've been running and running with no end in sight. No relief in sight. I'm just endlessly running while wearing a mask of a sane man."
'sUicIDe iS tHe eAsY wAy OUt',"Is that supposed to deter me?

Why would I want to take the hard way? I'm TIRED of taking the hard way, that's literally why I'm suicidal in the first place.

Trying to make us feel bad for wanting to die really isn't helpful. 

It just makes me feel like a terrible person for being weak which makes me want to die even more.

I really don't get some of these arguments...



Edit: I don't mean to say that the actual act of dying/taking your life is easy, but that suicide is giving up, and giving up is easier than continuing to live. I hope that makes sense.

It's like the actual suicide will be intense and scary, but afterwards I'll never have to experience anything ever again and I won't ever have to be conscious again."
Does anyone else ever think to themselves “any day now I’m going to kill myself”,I just feel like I’m constantly on some sort of pin and needle. Just no way in hell I can survive anymore. Each day is the same boredom and misery. Prison. Let me out. I just don’t see where it’s worth it. I’m not super talented so the creative ability necessary to better myself isn’t there. Self destructive plagues always end up fucking me up
"I spent 3 yrs writing this horror book, making a soundtrack for it, and making it viewable like a film. I put my heart into something that will go nowhere. I just want to fucking die. I’ve been made unemployed bc of coronavirus. I’m so stressed","I put an embarrassing amount of time into being a writer. So many hours spent at university studying and practicing. I would honestly stay at the library until it would close at 2 am and then sneak into a classroom to finish studying before classes would begin at 6 am. I won the praises of my professors, taking honors classes, being told I will go far. All for a Creative Writing degree that I can't do anything with. But It's been my dream since I was 11 and read Harry Potter to be a writer. I'm 29 now. That dream turned into a nightmare.


I've thought a lot about form and what a book could be. I felt literature has to be updated. Because now we have movies that are a lot more entertaining to watch than just sitting and staring at some lines on paper for hours. So I made a soundtrack for this book I wrote as though it were a film that cannot be made and I made a video for it so you can watch it rather than just read it. 


And now what? Post it to reddit? Hope it will go viral by spamming it? All that will do is get trolls to spit on something I spent so much time and energy on. Go to a publisher? So they can butcher it to make it palatable for large numbers of people? And to get a publishing deal, it would take months. And before I could a publishing deal, I would need to get a literary agent, which also would take months. And then, it would probably be another year before it would hit the shelves. And then, on top of all this, to add insult to injury, I, the writer, would make very little. The profits, if there would be any off of my book would go mostly to the publisher and to the agent. This is because I would just be starting out. I'm not a veteran established writer like Murakami or Rushdie. They can get better deals. Me though? I would have to wait 3 years and see very little in return. 


I have it all already prepared though and available right now. I just can't reach an audience. I don't know how to. In my mid-20s I had a youtube channel that was growing in popularity. Precisely because I did post on reddit. A lot of people seemed to like what I was doing. But, it grew to be so frustrating having to deal with trolls and comments who hated me only because I was posting something I made. Like it's the worst thing in the world trying to advertise something I put a lot of work into. It's not like I was making hundreds of posts. Any post I would make where I would say: ""I made this"" it would get nothing fucking really negative comments by people who wouldn't even take the time to read what I wrote or listen to the poem I would read - they would hate my post, just because I posted about something I made. I mean they treated it like I was forcing my work down their throats, but am I forcing my work on people by making a post about it? You don't have to click. It's just a post and I would make those kind of posts because hey maybe someone out there who I haven't reached yet might like what I do. Is that really so terrible? I don't understand why people treat it like it's the worst thing in the world and like it's so aggravating and annoying. Companies can have advertisements, but me, a single person, trying to do something on my own, it's not called advertisement, it's called ""spam"" instead. It was so frustrating. I didn't become famous, I'm not saying this, but I did get attention eventually and I did grow in popularity. Precisely because I did post to reddit and stopped saying ""I made this"" to ""I found this."" Instantly got more recognition. One night while I was drunk I deleted everything I made and my entire online presence, because I was so frustrated by this. 1,700 subscribers on youtube, videos with tens of thousands of views. All gone. I could try posting my things on reddit again, but oh my fucking God there is no way I'm doing that a second time. It was a nightmare to get that far, I'm not making that mistake a second time (except now bc this is a support subreddit and this is all more confessional and I hope people'd be a bit more tolerant and to provide context here's what I wasted 3 fucking years of my life on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPLcoexhuMI)

What else can I do? Write like Rupi fucking Kaur and shit all over instagram like all these ""instapoets""? Just write a couple sentences draw some stick figures, I could get fame for that. It'd be very easy. But I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror and be proud of what I accomplished. Suicide I guess is what happens to people who try to have dignity in this world today where everyone besides the wealthy are nothing and worthless. If you don't whore yourself out it seems you will be a failure.


I lost my job because of the coronavirus. I can't bring myself to get unemployment. I have never been on government assistance. I feel weird even getting this $1,200 check. I grew up in a libertarian/objectivist household. I can't get something for free, I can only be ok with myself if everything I have I worked for. I always told myself I would die before being in this position. I try to have integrity and pride. This is just humiliating. And it was humiliating working at my previous job. Knowing I could have capable of so much more, knowing I could have done so much more with my life, that at one point I honestly had fans - even my very own creeps like one who drove hundreds of miles just to meet me! And people were praising what I was doing in college...I feel like Nick Drake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOFgM3mFIqw


I've never felt so hopeless and stressed out and like a loser and so many other things. There's a million other things. I have no money. I don't have money for rent next month. I don't have money for food. Some of you might not understand but I'd rather die than take unemployment benefits. I am more suicidal than you can possibly know. I am trapped. Stuck. I can't believe I'm 29 and in this position. All those dreams I had as a kid about being the next JK Rowling...I've been doing a lot of research. I have a method figured out. It seems almost inevitable that I will end it. I can't do this anymore."
i just took all the remaining pills of my 5 prescriptions. goodbye.,"title says most of it. a month ago i tried to jump off the golden gate bridge and got detained and 5250ed. things haven’t gotten better and i’m just done. this life isn’t for me. it’s my time to go. i’m really sorry to all the people who love me. i feel bad but i cant stick around anymore. i hope things get better for anybody reading this. goodbye

update: i survived, i’m in the ICU right now, they said i would’ve died if i didn’t come in. thank you everyone for your kind messages and caring, i’ll try to reply to everyone but it’ll take some time considering :( thank you all 💙"
"I told my abusive narcissistic sadist of a mother to “Fuck off, eat the shit that comes out of your mouth & die painfully you sadistic cunt!” Right before cutting contact with her.","My mother has been cruel, verbally, emotionally, psychologically & physically abusive ever since I can remember. For example when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia & severe depression when I was 7, she took a tarantula from outside, threw me in a closet, threw the spider in & locked me in there while screaming like a banshee. That 8 legged monstrosity bit me 5 times before I passed out from fear. When I woke up, there were 4 more bites. She always made me her scapegoat. The first out of my 9 suicide attempts took place when I was 9 years old. When she found out that I started cutting myself, she severely beat me & called me a mistake. Years have passed & after starting to see a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed with severe PTSD & a severe anxiety disorder. I tend to drink to cope with my problems. If anyone were to personally ask me how I would describe myself, I’d say, “Damaged beyond recovery & broken beyond repair.” I barely sleep in fear of yet again reliving my past in my nightmares. I’m 24 now & I’ll be 25 this year. Damn, to those who read this post, I need to know. Was I wrong to tell her off like that?"
I made a post on this subreddit asking for someone to give me some hope and somebody downvoted it. Fuck this.,"Guess it's a sign.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the overwhelming support. it means more to me than you might think."
Will I EVER commit suicide? Probably not. Do I think about doing it? Every. Single. Day.,"I don't know if I could ever bring myself to do it. There has been attempts before in the past, but never too serious to the point where I needed to be hospitalized. Once saw a post that said, ""Can I have a 30 day free trial of being dead?"" Never related to something so much in my damn life. Let me be an accident, not to the point where I die, but maybe in a coma for a while. Just to escape. 

I'm the friend that no ones wants to hang out with. I don't have anybody. I made a bad reputation for myself in high school and college (mainly just rumor-based) and I never bounced back from it because of my anxiety. I don't know who I am. I don't know what love is. Being suicidal is the only feeling I truly and wholeheartedly know, which is both comforting and petrifying at the same time. 

Lord forgive me, I'm going to need it. "
My dad recorded a video of me walking down the street,"He showed it to me on his pc, showing my hands in my pockets, my head down, obviously looking quite dead-faced. Telling me he showed this to me to show what u look like to the rest of the world, an overweight loser who will never get anothet girlfriend stuck in his own thoughts. I feel so weird and dirty that. I was recorded the one time I wasn't putting on a front, pretending I had my shit together head held up high. Maybe it's his fucked up way of trying to motivate me to sort my shit out but it just makes me wish I could stop existing. I fucking hate myself more. My family obviously hates me, maybe if I go they will feel sad for a bit but then as time goes on they'll forget about me. I know a spot off the local trail, maybe tonight, I'm not yet sure 😔 I want this pain in my head to go away. I'm sick of feeling stuck"
this world fucking sucks.,nothing is fair. it’s all luck. there are shitty people. nothing anyone does has made my life better. i know i will kill myself eventually. why the fuck wouldn’t i. our whole species is one giant fucking machine. there is no god. there is no one who wants me. the few good things are far outweighed by the bad things. i refuse to feel like this for seventy more years
My despicable legacy,"Today, as 25th may I've decided to kill myself. Not sure if it's because I've finally gathered enough confidence, or if it's because I finally understand things I didn't before. I do not seek help, however, attention would be nice, to be heard at least one time in my life; to finally show the world my most secret flaws, my archivements, the things I've accomplished, the bad memories, overall: to finally tell my despicable legacy. 

I feel invisible. 

I've been invisible my whole life. While never completely ignored, always felt invisible. 
I feel alone, even when I'm with the ones that are close to me; it is something I've been trying to stop for around 10 years, but finally give up.

At first, I was born as an accident, I've never been told that, nor made feel that way, but is clear that a mother who is 19, and a father who is 21, didn't exactly planned a child outside even a stable relation. 
I was lucky to be born in a somewhat rich family. I lived with my mother, her parents and my uncle until I was 5, then moved to a flat, with my mother and her new husband. 
From 0 to 4 life was decently good, I don't personally recall any bad experiences, but I was told recently from my grandmother that I would usually cry and reject being taken from my home to hers. I don't know why. 
My dad was poor by that time, he was still studying as a ecologist. He was present, to be fair, he was more present when I couldn't remember. 

From 5 to 12 I lived in the flat I mentioned early. I was there alone most of the day. Now I think, what kind of parent would leave a kid alone in a flat at the age of 5? Well, one that clearly didn't care enough. At 6 I joined school, the same monotous hell I assisted for 12 years. I never really fitted with the average person. I wasn't an outcast, or a creep, I had friends. They weren't good friends, but they were friends after all. We would normally go to each other houses and play together, watch movies, etc. 
I never did good in school, I barely did decent. Parents reacted in the only logical way they could think of, by beating me. Luckily my mother and dad broke up when I was around 3, so each of them went their way. 
My father never, ever hit me. He was a rational man who believed in dicipline through love, tho he never showed me love. 
Nothing particulary especial happened from the age of 6 to 12, besides being bullied by some classmates; leading me to bully the ones who were weaker than me, which I completely regret. 

At the age of 10 this odd feeling started in my chest, some kind of void? Some kind of sucking force that was draining my energy, my happiness and somehow, my willing to live. I didn't understand it. I had no idea why it was happening. Suddenly, the world was no more love painted. A great hatred towards this new enviorement grew in me. To see everyone as an enemy. Years later I understood that was when my depression began, my daily prison, the loneliness I feel every day; that was the starting point. 
At 12, I cannot recall what was in especific that made me cut, but something made me look for some kind of redemption in flagellation. I enjoyed it to some degree. I never did it to a serious level, and I stopped fairly quick, it only lasted for around 6 months. Months of carving my hatred and depression in my horrible body. 
I forgot to mention that I've been called, or been made feel ugly my whole life, untill today. So a natural doubt about myself, and my body arise, and it's been here with me since so long... 

At this point I'm a bit drunk. Getting everything ready for my departure, as I listen to There's no beauty left here, amazing album. 

Sadly I never got hug any significant another, let alone kiss. I never felt the love of someone else, never got to cuddle anyone, to trust, to love, to have sex with, to share my thoughts. I've always been by my own, I've always been alone. What saddens me the most, is that I've never been heard. I've always been ignored.

Invisible. That's what I've been feeling like for about 4 years. 

Everyone around me gets talked by others. Others interact with others, but not me. 
It covers many aspects, not only been talked but... I don't know how to explain it. I am a somewhat smart person, but sometimes I believe I'm really invisible? 
Sometimes I talk to people in real life, and they just ignore me? 
Philosophy has been an interesting topic for me, yet I cannot answer myself. If I'm ignored like that, am I even there? Was I part of a community? 

But this is about the good things I did, too. 
I joined the fire brigade. Had a good time there, it filled myself more than any other activity, I helped men, women and children. Tho it was never enough to bury the loneliness and emptiness I felt. 

I also rescued a kitty that was pregnant! I called her Mamou, she had 4 little kitties which I gifted to people I knew who would take good care of them. 

But it's been 2 years since I've been living on my own, Mamou died 3 weeks ago, which made me realize the futily of life. But overall, made something a bit more clear for me. It wasn't hatred what I felt for the world, but disappointment. We've come so far as a species. We have so much potential, but it's been wasted, and me myself I am guilty of this. I haven't done anything remarkable. 
I am disappointed at the selfishness, the antipathy, the greed, and the distancing of humans. 

For those reasons I am sorry for whoever will have to clean my body, or cremate it? I am sure my parents won't want a funeral for me. I mean, even less with whats going on with the world right now 

That leads me to my next point, betrayal, backstabbing and abandon. That's what some of my friends did to me. They ditched me out of their lives like a spent torch, like a used tissue. 
Sure, I did a mistake, I admit it. I did many mistakes. But looking at them in a objective way, is not much different of what our true nature is, in other words, I never did something worth abandoning your friend, and then getting them fired of their job.

Quarantine is fucked up, makes me realize that the little chances I had of meeting someone before, now are completely gone. Tho it hasn't been all bad, I got fit. I lost a lot of weight. I've read hundred of classic and cult books, same for music. 

Anyway, to the last point. The things I most regret in life? Probably not being more myself, that would have probably brought more pain, but it is uncertain. 
I regret never meeting and loving someone, it was harsh seeing everyone around me find someone, everyone but me. 

If you made it this far, I cannot properly explain how much I appreciate the time you dedicated reading this. This is more attention than all the one I've been given through my whole life. It felt really good to open up after so long

I am Tomás Renard, these are the last words I want to say before leaving this world, and venturing into the next one. If anyone is concerned, know I will leave happy that at least read this post. I will leave with the only thing that has been here for me my whole life, a nice bottle of pipeño wine"
I want to kill myself to avoid the future,"Generally speaking, my life isn’t terrible right now. But I know the future is going to be unimaginably painful and it scares the crap out of me. So much so that I’m willing to end it all to avoid it. 

Maybe I’m just overreacting, since what I’m scared of is what pretty much everyone goes through. But I really don’t want responsibility. I hate that the more I age, the more people expect of me. I don’t want to turn 18 and suddenly be an adult, thrown out to the world. There’s so much that will have to be done in my life and I can’t handle it. 

Getting into university, getting a job, a drivers licence, hell even just the idea of having to get groceries... it all scares me. I feel like everything is happening too fast. 

I hate that this problem isn’t something I can just fix. It will never “get better” because what troubles me is life itself. How am I supposed to fix the fact that I’m too anxious to live?"
"My name is Tyler, that’s my real name this is my only account, I’m highly suicidal, have been since I was about 6-7 years old, I’m 26 now and it’s different now. I’m going to tell you my story in a new attempt to gain enough relief to fall asleep tonight. Thanks for reading if you do <3","
Growing up, I was always a really weird kid. I distinctly remember that I had just seen the world differently. It seemed that my imagination had a bigger play in my life than most. Me and a friend in kind garden would squeeze batteries in our hands and pretend that we were Mario or Pokémon because neither of our families could/would buy us a game console but we were exposed to them by relatives and tv. It was so simple back then and looking back so pure,  but it felt like we were there. We didn’t have what other kids had to have fun so we became those things. As far as I know I was a decent enough kid however when my brother came along around age 4, we would fight, I would hurt him, not bad (typically young brother bs) but still enough to get beaten from my father when he got off work. My father more so was (he is still with us) a rigid, traditionally Hispanic in parenting, angry, regretful person. When he was in the house there was always a strange energy of danger even if nothing was going on. It was better to just stay quiet. This didn’t really work because my younger brother soon learned that it was an easy win when we’d bicker to just cry out loud, our dad would come in, beat my ass and I would curse my brothers name for doing so but alas it would get me to stop. My real last memory of child abuse before my teens is about 15 seconds of my dad putting me in a corner on the ground, telling me if I wanted to fight to put my hands up and when I did to just shield myself he pummeled me with closed fists. I was around 10 years old, maybe give or take a couple years, not sure, I have terrible memory of most my life. As I got older, my brother and I actually started bonding, he liked the way I started standing up to our dad no matter how bad I was beat down. He’s told me i inspired him. My mom btw is/was awesome, but didn’t really do much except yell to stop from the sidelines or leave the room since she couldn’t bear to watch. I can’t blame her, not much negativity felt towards her for I know she unconditionally loves me and that must’ve been a tough and traumatic experience for her as well. Moving forward, I’m a decent student, normally averaging around low A’s my brothers straight A’s if not 100’s, not much of a big deal there, my mom started adding incentives once we grew into our early teens (for every A we got in a semester she’d give us like 10 dollars or something, it was dope so we did well). Through out life I feel like I found connections that I would replace for my fathers love, through friendship. I grew very close and desperately wanted to fit in with my friends. I would spend hours out of the house riding bikes around the neighborhood doing dumb lil kid shit, but it was a really freeing time out I remember. Fast forward, around when I was 14, my brother 11 my mom bought me a bass guitar because I had been getting into random enough Japanese rock from the anime I would watch and to me the bassist was always the most bad ass and going crazy member, my brother came along and she bought him a guitar spur of the moment, figured it would help us bond. It did. It really did and I thank everything in this world for those times that followed because they were hands down the best years of my life. I was a shitty bassist and soon transitioned over to wanting to be a singer and my brother excelled at guitar, going onto be called a prodigy by everyone from teachers, producers and most of the respected music industry people we would eventually encounter. But at the time he was my little brother and being a fresh teen thought it would be wack to have my 11 year old brother in the band. I started a couple bands, the second one introducing my brother in as lead guitar. This was a turning point.

Back to family life, my dad started to realize he was aging and I was starting to gain my testosterone fueled teenage body, this didn’t stop anything, but only extended our fights into actual fights. My dad, a correction officer, doing manual labor his whole life handed my ass to me every time. All while telling me to kill myself and how no one loved me and I was a mistake. Nothing like this was said to my brother, unless in terms of how I’ve manipulated him into becoming just like me. I became a bit of a shitty protector of the house hold, two accounts stick out immeasurably to me. The first being (funny kind of a call back to how my brother would yell for my dad to come) my brother was upstairs and screamed Tyler help dad just hit me. In a blind fury, i bum rushed my dad onto the floor, commanded my brother to hold his arms down and pummeled him in his face, chest, balls, anywhere i could hit before he brother free all while yelling the likes of “it used to just be me, that’s where you should’ve left it”. It was a powerful moment. My father spent the rest of the week walking downstairs like a caged tiger screaming and laughing about how he was going to kill me. ‘‘Twas still a sweet victory. No fear.

I’ll speed up the rest: me and my bro made a band, everyone betrayed us, we made another and took full control of who was in it, wrote all the music, what we looked like, who we recorded with, and what not. With his help i created a two year plan to get signed to a label called Fearless Records. We played metal. It was therapeutic and empowering stuff to play after everything you’ve read thus far. 

We did it in four months.

I got a text by our newly acquired manager that we had been offered a deal by the label of our dreams. I cried and got sent home early. A record that I wrote all the lyrics to and my brother wrote all the music to, all fueled by the hate and distinction of our father son dissonance. It was the biggest victory a small town probably has seen, at least our small town. Every time he said we were garbage, we should try something else, i couldn’t sing and my brother should play something nice. Every time he laid a hand on us, put into songs and we did it in four months! Still makes me proud to this day man. 

Btw, this isn’t a story about my father.
He is not the reason I want to kill myself anymore.

The label fucked us over, made us record 3 different records each time hating something that they previously wanted and we called it quits. Our deal was good n no need to recoup anything, just disband.

This is where whatever is inside me to this day was brought into this life. A foe I don’t know if I can beat this time. Throughout the story so far, I had a flame inside of me. The whole time a purpose to prove. A will to fight. I always told people that I wasn’t sad, I was angry. And the anger forged who I was. A determined, skill ful musician, with the mane of a lion and the attitude to match, a man who did it. But when that all went away. I became a worm, but not yet.

Shit with my dad cooled off, he retired. I’m assuming his job really was the culprit of the aggression and I stopped holding the past against him. At this point I had been a dumbass at points too and figured it was not worth the energy or the negativity of keeping that cloud around. Was he still an incredibly ill informed, ego centric prick? Yeah, but I was a different person now and couldn’t be bothered with it. Most times shrugging off his comments. I had worth now.

Me and my bro made another band with just our drummer from the previously signed act, but it didn’t last long, we did an all over the place EP that was uninspiring yet everyone we showed loved it. Drummer left, became a solo artist, he’s a whole other story. I can’t help but feel as tho I’m responsible for his and my brothers mental state as I’m 3-4 years older than both of them (i was always the dad figure to them).

Fuck it tho, rock n roll, we did it once we’ll do it again. Me and my brother move to Los Angeles California in hopes of creating a new sound within the fusion realm of rap, emo, metal, and pop genres. We moved with two of my friends from NY and got a shitty two bedroom apartment and split the rooms. The other two room mates were supposedly friends for years yet fought constantly, shit talked each other and created this crazy negative space in this 1000 sqft. It was not comfortable to say the least. However the one room mate in specific, targeted my brother, who at this point basically didn’t talk to either of them. (This is point one and point 2 is my confesssion) And then there was me, i had developed an alcohol problem, not that i drank every day or even every weekend. But when i did, i became a different person, i would usuallly drink myself to sleep as well. My brother picked me up from a bar one night and while on his way i began to get robbed. I refused it and tried to buy time and ended up running to his car when he got there. Amped on on about 10 jack n cokes and the adrenaline of potentially dying, i flipped shit on my brother. Cursing him out, saying i didn’t need him, i could pay someone 20 dollars to do what he does, etc. it was awful. And it was the last straw for him. Within the next week or so he packed up, quit his job and went back home. 

I was heartbroken, but covered it up with anger. My other two room mates, if you can believe it, convinced me that i didn’t need him and that he held me back. I thought I’d be okay and he’d come back, i left our room exactly how he left it for months. He didn’t. 

This was the final nail in the coffin for my mental state to date. I spend every night analyzing the past, and i think I’ve learned that at first i created a whole identity to hating my father, then after that i created a whole identity around me and my brothers music career and once he was gone and to this second of typing it, I’m lost. I don’t know what to do. My personality feels like it’s splitting. Some days I’m this really cool extroverted ladies man guy and some days I’m a worm in my bed spending money he doesn’t have on post mates so he doesn’t have to leave the apartment. When i sit down and try to write music, i can, but i don’t feel it anymore. It’s the only skill i have. I didn’t go to a real college because of the deal, I’m not good at anything and I’m not interested in anything other than music. But there’s no inspiration left in me. Nothing really makes me happy anymore. I had a gf, nothing, broke up with her, nothing i have a new one, i miss her sometimes but for the most part nothing, i have written 6 new songs, nothing, i post a photo on Instagram, nothing, i go to work, nothing, i watch a movie, nothing. Everything just seems so pointless now, i don’t see myself as the star i once did. I don’t even believe myself when i sing, or have conversation with people. It’s like I’m watching the most boring movie about someone that i just don’t even care about. I just want him to die. I just want to stop wondering and working and fighting, i don’t want to do it anymore, and i was the relief of death. 

Idk what i expect from this but it was slightly therapeutic, thanks for listening."
Anyone else feels like a burden to their friends?,"I feel like my only friend is tired of me. Honestly? I don't blame her. Dealing with a miserable fuck like me must be pretty tiring. Whenever I bring up the fact that I don't feel good or try to share something personal it almost feels as if she wants to tell me to fuck off lol I feel bad saying all this, she means a lot to me and I'm sure she means well but.. damn I feel really lonely and alone with my problems. Maybe I'm just whiny and selfish but sometimes I want more than ""Don't think about it, others have it worse"". Sometimes I feel like I'm the problem and just pretend that everything is okay so she won't get uncomfortable around me. Is it selfish to feel this way? I feel really alone."
Attempt failed. Currently in the hospital.,"I tried I really did, but the second I took the pills I instantly regretted it. I called 911. In the ambulance is when I really noticed what I had done. And having the paramedics there to calm me down and help me was everything to me. I'm currently in the hospital. I can't leave my room unless it's to go to the bathroom. I can't even close my curtain to get privacy. They took every single cable and metal object out of the room. I'm in terrible pain. I didn't sleep at all last night. Hospital beds are the worse. I miss my bed and my dog :( 

Despite the dreary scene of the hospital the nurses and doctors have been nothing but nice and supportive. The nurse who drew my blood even drew a little smiley face on my bandaid to cheer me up a little. One nurse even gave me her number in case I ever need some support. I've never been treated so nicely by a group of strangers. Every single one of them giving me a different purpose to live. Thankfully I didn't ingest too much pills to damage my body too much. Just slight kinda damage but nothing life threatening. 

But this has made me realize a lot. Life really is worth living. No matter your situation. There are PLENTY of people who can be there for you. Every single nurse and doctor here gave me thousands of resources to help me. And this has given me the will to live. 

I should be getting out by Tuesday when a psychiatrist comes to mentally evaluate me and give me permission to leave. Until then I'm in a hospital room prison being watched over like a baby but it's good to know that there's people out there who truly care. 

To all the people considering suicide. Please don't do it. It's not worth it. I truly thought I had no one and my family wouldn't care. But seeing their crying faces when the ambulance took me away made me realize that even when you think you have no one you're wrong. The selfish decision I made will be in my mind forever but it gives me a reason to go on. We're all strong enough if we really try. 

Stay strong and reconsider your choice. 


EDIT: I didn't think my post would get so much attention, seeing as my other posts wouldn't get much. I'm sorry if I can't reply to all of the comments it's really a lot! However, thank you to all the kind people and positive messages. I'm glad to see my story is helping others as well. "
GUILT TRIPPING IS NOT OK,"I've been told all my life ""Don't kill yourself you will hurt everyone else"" "" It's selfish"" ""Think about the people who have no choice"" I fucking know that!!

 You don't think I know that I'm going to make people sad and hurt? Do you even care what I might be going through? 

DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S SELFISH. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD. THEY JUST WANT THE PAIN TO END. 

That's all I want. It hurts too much. Stop telling me what I already know. I don't want to hurt anyone but I can't keep doing this shit"
Take A Second To Look Around..,"Do it, just take a second to look through this sub and look at all the people struggling to find a reason to live. Some people are fighting their hardest against impossible odds, some people never had a chance, some are nihilistic and don't see any reason to live and some like me have hereditary depression. And who cares? Genuinely who cares? I've come on here just to rant and I'd bet any amount of money you who's reading this did the exact same. Everyone is self absorbed, the only people who care about you (if any) can't help. They have their own lives to live. They beg people with depression and who are suicidal to ""talk"" well who do we fucking talk to? I don't have the money for a fancy fucking therapist, I honestly don't just feel sorry for myself right now.. I feel sorry for mankind. Do you think in a tribe if someone is crying they walk past them and pretend they didn't see them? For whatever reason this 21st century, though being the safest and most peaceful time in all of history. Is also some on the most uncaring, sociopathic fucked up times in history. Well... maybe not. Maybe the world has always been fucked and we just have selective memory. 

No-one cares about you, no-one cares about me. I wish I could look out the window and see a fucking meteorite screeching towards Earth. I'm done, I really don't know how I am going to get through Christmas this year so I might as well leave a trail so my family don't blame themselves if I do something. I doubt I will, I'm a pussy and too scared. So I'll just sit in my misery, watch another year come and wonder how I will survive this new year coming."
"UPDATE THANK YOU, EVERYONE,​ WHO PUSHED ME TO LIVE!!!!!!!", THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO HELPED!!!!!!!! so after posting this 28 days ago I wrote my Best friend who's out of state a suicide note and I closed my phone and social media and popped some pills and right then there was a knock at my door and it was the cops they took me to a psychiatric ward were I spent a few days a little over a week it felt like a month but I swear I meet some amazing people and my family and friends visited every day and now I'm on my medication and things are turning around a lot!!!!!! I'm moving out to my Best friend and taking a semester off to recoup from school I explained to my friend about the 1k and she wasn't sweating it she said my life was more important but long story short everything worked out I love you strangers and thank you for helping me\^\_\^!xoxoxox
Being an ugly woman is... difficult to say the least,"Trust me, it's just as difficult for ugly girls as it is for guys - there's nothing worse than seeing your peers and friends being hit on and asked on dates, while you just blend into the background. I wake up every single day feeling lost and defeated, wondering if starving myself would make me at least a bit more appealing. it's so hard to go on social media, to see the gorgeous smiles and lovely relationships and perfect figures of other girls. 

and then there's me. 

i've been called ugly and unappealing my entire life, even my father has said so, multiple times. no guy takes a second glance at me. i'm not even smart or talented or witty either, so there's no hope for me at all. i just think.. how different my life would be if i at least looked normal, or if i had even money for cosmetic surgery. it's so hard to have a gorgeous mother and sister, and cousins who could easily be models - when you're just a fat, unappealing blob in the corner, begging for a sliver of attention.

i just don't see the point. looking in the mirror is excruciating, posing for photos unbearable. i just want to drink myself into a stupor all the time. there's just no point to life if you're a fat and ugly girl"
Anyone else surprised they survived through 2018?,I’m surprised. How the fuck did I do it? I think about suicide almost every day but I did it. 
I take reassurance in the fact I can kill my self if things get too bad,"I guess I’m sort of at peace with the idea now. It’s strangely given me a tranquility to life and made me not worry, as if things get too bad I can just end it."
You ever just feel sad and want to write a huge rant but you can’t come up with the energy or the words?,Haha yeah
found and performed cpr on dead friend/looking for help,"I found my best friend dead from hanging herself just under 3 weeks ago now, I called the ambulance and untied her and gave her CPR for 12-14 minutes before anyone showed up. They ended up working on her for 60-90 minutes and got a faint heart beat back and she was put into an induced coma. I had to call her boyfriend and ex/best friend and we all spent the night in the ICU. I spent a week in shock, meeting her parents who flew in from interstate. Her father thanked me for giving them the opportunity to say goodbye to her. For the first  6 days it seemed there was such a low chance of her making any kind of recovery that we were just waiting for her family to decide to withdraw life support. I had begun grieving, although I was by her bed most days and evenings brushing her hair talking to her and reading to her from our favorite poetry books. On about day 6/7 they decided to take her off sedation and see what would happen and she ended up opening her eyes in front of me for the first time. It was a miracle, and it was also the saddest part reflectively of the entire experience. All she could do was lay and sob. I spent a few days with her like this. I would talk to her and I knew she could hear me because there would be certain things she would cry about and then certain things I would say would calm her back down. It was so incredibly painful. I was convinced over these days I had ruined her life by doing what I did. She was dead when I found her and that I had brought her back to a life of hell. It was my worst fear that she would stay in that state forever, I just couldn’t wrap my head around how incredibly unjust that would be. She ended up within 24 hours of having her breathing tube taken out and her sedation completely ceased able to start breathing on her own, speaking a little and even started moving. It’s all been so surreal. Now that shock has worn off I’m having constant flash backs and panic attacks. I have constant invasive thoughts of killing my self. It’s so painful. I truly want to die, I feel so conflicted and invisible. Because she is recovering our mutual friends almost have forgotten just how traumatic this experience has been for her first and foremost (and realistically this is only just the beginning of a very painful road for her...) and traumatised I am from finding her, untying her, giving her cpr while I knew she was dead, cleaning the blood off the door she was hanging from, and spending 2 straight weeks by her side through every single state in ICU. I even moisturised her arms and legs so her scars would heal properly because nobody was doing it for her. I’m so heart broken. I want to die. I feel invisible and I don’t know where to put my pain. I have nobody because it’s too heavy for anyone to deal with, and all our mutual friends just want to focus on the positives that she is recovering which I understand but it’s like they don’t understand that she hung herself. I’m traumatised for life, and her life is changed for ever even if she does make a full recovery which who knows—she’s still very brain damaged and doesn’t even know what’s happened to Her. I have never posted before, I don’t know anyone who’s had any kind of similar experience. It’s so layered and I have a 11 year history of self harm and drug use, both of which I had recovered from, years since I have self harmed and 3 months since I have used drugs or alcohol, but all I want to do is hurt myself in anyway I can.

Edit: she had hung herself on the back of her door, so by opening her bedroom door that’s how she was released from hanging. I called 000 immediately as I untied the belt from her neck and checked if she was breathing or had a heart beat. All I did was find her and untie her and try wake her up realise she was very obviously dead/not conscious and call 000 and then do what they told me to until anyone arrived because I was in so much shock I was just doing what they were telling me to, even when the woman was like you need to somehow get into that room and I had to kick her desk back and squeeze my way into her bedroom I had no idea why the woman was saying she needed to be laid out flat on her back until all of a sudden the woman was telling me to give her mouth to mouth then I realised I was about to do CPR. I was screaming and crying why are you making me do this she’s dead the entire time and the woman just kept saying I know *my name* but just keep helping her until help gets there. So I did"
Fantasising about being saved.,"I often daydream about trying to jump off a bridge and having someone grab me from the edge, hold me tight and tell me it will be okay.
 
We all want what we can’t have, I guess."
It’s a sad world when a 15 year old kid is contemplating suicide to escape his emotionally abusive parents.,"I’m sick of being called “a fu*king animal” by the people who are supposed to raise me to be a productive adult. It’s years of emotional trauma brought up by their anger towards each other that they take out on me verbally. I don’t get help for any of my issues and they refuse to believe that I’m spiralling towards rock bottom.

 I thought since my friends couldn’t care less, my parents called me ungrateful a hotline just told me “life will be okay soon”, I’ll just open up to the two strangers here on reddit."
Do you ever go to sleep early wishing you never wake up?,"I have been doing that every night for the past weeks, I try to sleep early thinking and wishing that will be the last time I will be awake."
i kind of want to fail a suicide attempt just to show people that im struggling,"i know this is fucked up, but i feel like no one cares about me, no matter what i do or say. no one ever worries about me, no one ever notices my cries for help. i just feel like the only way to make them notice how shitty im actually doing is by doing something drastic like this. but then again, would anyone even care?"
"I called a hotline last week, now I owe thousands.","20m here. Tried overdosing last week but I still woke up. Then I called the hotline cause I needed someone to talk to. I thought it would be like free therapy. Boy was I wrong. Told them what happened, even gave them a fake name and location but the person on the other line deemed that I was a risk to myself. They got the info by pulling up the provider from the phone I was calling from and going to the address listed. Since I moved out, they actually ended up at my parents house while my brother was home and tried to find me there. My heart sank when my brother called me cause I pretty much SWAT'd him just then. The popo called me and I told them my address, they left my brother alone and two paramedics with two officers came to my unit after. They told me I needed to come with them and they would bring me by force if necessary.
Now for context; my mountain of debt, a car accident, and getting fired from several jobs in a row without any potential future prospects all led me to a suicidal state of mind that day. When the ambulance pulled up my heart sank again cause guess what? I have zero insurance.

I voluntarily go with the EMTs, stayed in an emergency room for 8 hours, then was discharged. 

Fast forward to now and I just opened up a letter in the mail for the invoices from the hospital to the tune of three grand. 

I've been pretty stable since then but seeing that letter this morning caused a violent stress induced break down. Some nights I think about how if I haven't sought help from the hotline that day I might be better off than I am today. Maybe alive or dead, but probably better off either way. I feel intense regret for trying to connect with someone. I didn't leave a suicide note that day. I probably won't ever leave a note when I go. Ideally, id just fade away."
i was raped,"i cant feel anything, im numb. my best friend raped me on saturday. i feel like i did something wrong. i dont deserve to live. im just a slut. i should just kms already"

Anyone else’s suicidal thoughts get triggered by the smallest things?,"i don’t even want to write out the small things that happen because they sound so stupid when i look back on them, but 9 times out of 10 they just result in me crying and wanting to die maybe im just weak and pathetic"
I tried killing myself today.,"I wanted to jump off the top of a church tower, about 80m up. The church was supposed to be open, but just when I got there, a man came out from the entrance and ushered me out the gates because the church was closing early today. Somewhat ironically the name of the church is ""our Saviour's church"".

Talked with a close friend just now and I'm gonna seek professional help tomorrow. This time this shit has gone too far. Had I arrived even half an hour earlier, I wouldn't be here right now. Such a surreal feeling."
i dont want to kill myself but i see no other future other than me killing myself,"i know it sounds weird, some people die of heart attacks, other suffer years of battle from cancer i see myself killing myself at some point, its like a vision that i have and it doesn't go away, almost like its my fate."
I am the kid that tries to join your friend group but fails. I am the kid that can’t take a hint. I am the kid that no one likes. I am the weird kid. I want to die.,"So I have always been that weird kid who kinda tries to join a friend group and they hint they don’t like you but your motivated to join anyways. I’m super weird. Everyone thinks I’m annoying. And it goes much deeper than that. Yes. There are some parts of my life such as family that I’m lucky for. But I just wish I was with different people. I want to die. Why was I put on this world if my only purpose was to be called names, bullied, have no friends, and be the most annoying person on planet earth. Why did they do this. Please help me. I’m so tired of me giving in and asking to be invited to things and trying to be friends but they won’t give back. I have tried with everyone. I’m tired and crying. And I don’t wanna die before 16 but I think I should. I don’t know what to do and I’m crying as I write this. Why. Why"
Being born ugly sets you up to fail,"They say looks don’t matter, but unfortunately that isn’t true. For some of us, the amount of grooming, styling and exercising we do just can’t fix bad genes. While adults may not judge someone on face value if they are unattractive, being made fun of as a kid leads to a chain of effects

Get made fun for appearance as a kid/teen...

Don’t have anyone to hang with...

Shattered confidence...

Staying home on weekends and not talking much during school...

Not developing social skills...

Being socially inept as an adult

Most of my quirks are in my bone structure so it would take some serious plastic surgery to address them. I’m so angry at myself for skipping on an opportunity to fix a very big flaw with my appearance 5 years ago because some yes-men convinced me I was okay. I’m not."
Thanks reddit,"Thanks to everyone who gave support

Because of you I didnt kill myself"
Failed suicide attempt,"Yesterday I clean my house, packed my bag with robe and went into the woods. I arrived there at 10pm and smoked a few sigartes and listened to the animal noises. I prepared my rope and let myself drop. The first minute was peacefull but then I started having a panic attack and started seeing all blurry and my hearing went away. If I didn't have my pocket knife to cut the rope I was gone. But I was to much of a coward and cut it. Some people know like my father but they don't care. I really need a hug. I haven't heard or seen someone familiar in the past 2months. I really grave love, understanding, kidness, a hand, a shoulder. I am so lonely. I don't understand that people don't care what happened yesterday I don't. Am I this bad of a person? U don't think so I'm just mentally unstable. Anyone from Belgium whom wants to be my friend? I don't  want to be pathetic but I'm so lonely I miss love so much. I'm going to stop now I don't want to cry ;) thanks in advance for the people reading this."
nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide,"I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the ""right way"" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or ""choosing"" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow."
I tried to kill myself but survived and no one knows,"January  8th 2020 I was driving home listening to Amy Winehouse and decided that this was my time. It was on a windy, empty country road, late at night, in torrential rain- accidents happened there all the time. I had just finished having dinner with my housemate at University and was on my way to my hometown to see my family. No one would suspect a thing. I closed my eyes, let go of the steering wheel and put my foot down. 

When I opened my eyes my vision was blurred, but I could see that my windshield had caved in. I proceeded to crawl out across the passenger seat, opening the door with my elbow as hands were covered in shards of glass. There was no shock, no confusion. I felt a small sense of relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and a bigger sense of relief that I hadn‘t hit anyone else. But other than that, I still felt just as dead inside as I had prior to the crash.

I went through the motions. Strangers came to my aid, followed shortly by the paramedics and later my parents. I laughed and smiled through it, cracking jokes about ordering my preferred cocktail of pain relief and apologising for keeping everyone up so late. I had just survived a near fatal car crash and already the guilt and shame of everyone worrying about me was kicking in.

I had aquaplaned across the road, accelerating into a hedge, before flipping my 2004 corsa four times, knocking down a row of silver birches in the process and spinning 20m down the country lane. I had landed upright but the roof of the car had moulded around my headrest. I’m only 5’2”, if I was a couple of inches taller my head would have been caved in. I should have been dead. 

Instead, I spent a week in hospital lying on my back, completely immobilised, awaiting my C7 spinal surgery. Post-surgery, my doctor told me he’d seen MRI scans like mine where the patient had already been paralysed, so I guess the fact that I walked out of hospital after 9 days with Just a neck brace was a silver lining. 

Since then I‘ve carried on keeping up appearances. Things have changed, some for the better, some for the worse. For a while, my frustration that I had survived was outweighed by my relief that I wasn’t paralysed, and in truth that is still the case. But my fear of putting my family through something like that again is starting to wear off. It‘s a constant fight between my happiness and their grief. What’s more important? Should I continue to suffer silently in a world where I feel completely lost and alone, just to postpone their mourning for what will eventually happen anyway?"
"the only existence sadder than being suicidal is being suicidal but with the option of suicide taken away from you because if you were to kill yourself, you would kill someone else too",i dont think my mom would be able to survive me dying
I am the comedian,"I am the one who everybody says makes them smile. I make people laugh. I build them up. I reinforce positivity. I shine a bright light on every person I encounter. I’ve been called “the happiest guy at (company name)”. I love giving compliments.

Why? Because I know how it feels to need to hear those things.

I am the one, who once the adrenaline of building up others dies down, is in the darkest place. I laugh, I joke, I praise, I do what I do because I want no others to feel the way I do. But if only they knew..."
"No one really cares, they're only trying to make themselves feel good.","A while back I removed myself from the contacts of my 'friends,' trying to isolate myself before I stepped in front of a bus. No one spoke to me, ever reached out. I had to initiate every conversation, I was the runt hanging around that no one had the balls to formally tell to fuck off. Of course, the moment I do leave, everyone suddenly cares, everyone is buzzing my phone asking what's up and how I'm doing, they even got a hold of my parents. It escalated at some point to where the only one from that group I had any respect for is on the phone pleading that I don't die, that suicide is irrational and that I should consider meds.

Guess what, I said sure, I won't die, I'll go back business as usual. And you know what, it is business as usual. I am never anyone's first choice, I haven't spoken to another human in over a month. Even when I come back from an attempt it's like I died anyway. Really glad I got talked out of it, it would fucking suck if I missed out on being ignored and forgotten again."
"Why do they always say that ""death is not a solution"", and then fail to provide one?","If nobody can give me a solution, then maybe I should do things my way. The alternative is you guilting me for wanting to die without providing me with another way to deal with this."
I’ve started wishing that I would randomly die of a natural cause in order to avoid suicide.,"Over the past month leading into June has been the worst its been in a while. Almost anything has sent me into the thoughts of killing myself. About two years ago I used to cut to deal with this but i stopped and have been clean since. I still sometimes drag slightly sharp items across my skin but never enough to cut or leave a mark. Now suicide is an every day thought in my head even on good days. Im a minor and not allowed to seek treatment or medicine. I firmly believe that when I go it will be due to my own hand. Whenever I get sick or feel pains that are abnormal, I no longer tell anyone in hope that it’ll kill me before I do and that my family and friends will have me dead due to something medical and not suicide. I don’t know what I believe in but I have even found myself praying to have a stroke or a heart attack just to end it all or praying to fall asleep and not wake up. I don’t know what to do anymore. Im struggling to live."
Mental illness is bullshit,"Life is shit. The world is going to hell. We're slaves to our wages. There's no fucking point to anything and it's got nothing to do with mental health. The world is just shit and I want nothing to do with it. I'm not fucking sick. I'm sick of people telling me I'm sick in a piece of shit world that's sick. If anything, I see the world better than most. There's really no point to be here. Why prolong this endless suffering? If anyone says I'm selfish, they're the fucking selfish ones for wanting me to be here only to help them while I fucking suffer every moment. Fuck everything."

"I'm quite convinced that depression will kill me someday, and I'm okay with that.","Until that day comes, however, I can only do my best.

Everything is okay."
Can we not gatekeep suicidal depression?,"Hello. I had an interesting conversation with another redditor the other day from my post. I was gonna attempt and this person tried to talk me down, only to get agitated at me and say,” you’re only attention seeking and wasting good people’s time.” Like isn’t the point of this subreddit to be a bit attention seeking? I wanted someone to talk me out of it. But don’t tell me that I’m not suicidally depressed, you don’t fucking know me and what I’m going through. You shouldn’t have that attitude if you’re trying to help people on here. Thank you all, I hope you have a good day."
Its 1 am and I dont want to sleep because I'm not ready to wake up and deal with another fucking day.,Anyone else procrastinate going to sleep so you can lay in bed and have more of the sweet silent calm darkness?
Wrote this while sitting on a bridge looking down,Each night like this. I just want to slip into the water. And come up in a new place. And breath a different air. In a world far from here.
"Please, At Least Read The Last Few Sentences","This is a lot to read. So if you don't want to read it all, then please just read the last few sentences. You can even ignore the link.

&#x200B;

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

&#x200B;

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

&#x200B;

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of ""suicide watch"", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's ""better"" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

&#x200B;

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

&#x200B;

I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.

&#x200B;

If someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out.

If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us.

I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end.

Thank you."
"well guys, i’m alive",i stayed up the whole night last night going back and forth with my bottle of pills. i guess i won.
Imagine how pleasant it would be to sleep forever,"I don't want to die per say, but I also don't want to be alive. It's too hard and I'm not cut out for it. 

The only place where I feel relief is when I'm asleep. When I'm asleep nothing bothers me, nothing can hurt me. I just wish it could be like that forever."
The only meaning of life quote that makes any sense,"The literall meaning of life is whatever you're doing that prevents you from killing yourself.

"I tried to hang myself, the belt broke.","I stood on that chair for what felt like forever. Some part of me was waiting for someone to come stop me, tell me how stupid I was and that my life was worth living. Nobody stopped me. Nobody cared. So I stepped off the chair, and felt the belt squeeze around my neck. I blacked out within a couple seconds. And what they say about “how everyone’s final thoughts are that they wish they didn’t do it” it’s bullshit. My last thoughts were of relief. Anyway, I woke up on the floor feeling woozy, and I didn’t even remember I had just tried to kill myself. This is the closest I’ve come to ending my own life. I just can’t exist anymore."
My parents asked me to kill myself,I have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out. So i reached out to my parents after a meltdown. Its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues. I don't share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them. Anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about. My own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y don't i do it if i really am depressed. Great solution actually. Now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally. Maybe i won't be a liar anymore...maybe i can finally find peace
I think my depression is passing,"I'm not sad all the time anymore, my suicidal thoughts have gone, no more urges to cut, my psychosis is kind to me, homocidal ideation is gone. I feel great, happy I'm making it through one of the hardest times of my life."
I jumped off a (small) bridge,"Surprise! I lived. The water was quite a bit deeper than I thought, and luckily there were no rocks or tree branches just below the surface. I went headfirst, so any debri would have likely killed me outright, or knocked me out and caused me to drawn. 

I still got a concussion just from the water (FYI, concussions suck. Do not recommend). And after I somehow managed to not drown anyway, I swam to shore. Holy crap was it a long, cold walk home. 

Believe it or not, I didn’t think it was that big a deal. It didn’t really feel like a true suicide attempt. More like it blurred the lines between ‘self harm’ and ‘suicide’. Before the jump I had figured a ~90% chance I’d live if the water was deep (I was gambling a lot on that “if”). 

When I got home I told my family, thinking they would just let me go to sleep with some asprin, maybe take the next day off. Nope. Not a chance. We went *straight* to the ER. Then I was volunteered to go to the inpatient psychiatric unit. 

The psych ward. I was pretty terrified. I didn’t think I was worthy of such care. My issues were mild, weren’t they? It was just (extreme) self harm. 

I spent five days in the hospital. And frankly they were some of the most incredible days I’ve ever experienced in my life. I dealt with both extreme pain and euphoria. At several points, I *was* the hysterical, crying, inconsolable woman who you’d expect to find in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. 

But they didn’t do that to me. They talked to me, and they helped me. They gave me the mental and emotional tools to help myself. Somehow, they got me to admit that I *wanted* to live, even though I desperately believed I didn’t deserve to. I’m trying to remember, every minute of every day, that I *do* deserve to live. 

Anyway... that’s kinda my little story. 

TL;DR: Jumped off a bridge, landed in a psych ward, got legit help.

Edit: wow thanks for the support everyone! I’ll try to answer your questions in more detail when I get a chance.

Edit 2: this got a bit more attention than I thought, but I’m glad. If this enourages even one person to consider asking for help, or joining an inpatient phsyciatric program, I’ll be overjoyed."
Going to fight corona soon,"In a few hours my alarm will sound to wake me up for work. Work in a hospital, diagnosing and treating corona patients. I wish I could sleep, I could really use some rest before the shift.

But I am writing my suicide note and it is getting so long. I am writing about how I have been harassed and bullied by people I don't know. Who attacked me and yelled at me on the street when I was only trying to go home. I want someone to know, and sympathize with me, but I have never told anyone except reddit. I must really be repulsive when I offend people whom i don't even know.

Noone would read my suicide note. I don't have a single friend. At 30 years of age I have never been in a relationship. I have no family. Who would read this? 

I've written a suicide note every week for 10 years. But I just can't seem to end myself. I wish I could absorb the illnesses of my patients, like a superpower that lets them go home to their families and lets me die. Maybe I would be remembered as a hero.

I wish someone would read my note. But noone will. I have another meeting with corona in a few hours.

Edit: I am a transgender person, that's why people harass me. I suppose they think I am ugly and repulsive. I dont mind if you call me guy, they call me worse things but I wish I wasn't one. Anyway thank you for the sympathetic replies. Sorry, I don't know how to respond because it feels like noone can understand what it is like to feel like everyone hates you. I wish there were more of you out there instead of all these people who will hate you even though you're not hurting anyone. Thank you for saying something nice to a stranger."
Why is it so hard for some people to accept that life just isn't that great for some people?,"Some people just get completely, utterly screwed, traumatized and limited by life, to the point that living just isn't enjoyable anymore. To the point that any wild-eyed optimism one might have had in the face of adversity just gets drowned by the utter disillusionment that no - sometimes even if there was a will, there's wasn't much of any way, and even if there still is, it's not worth finding.

I've seen people say they can't even imagine what it must feel like to want to end your life or to even be depressed. On the flip side, it's hard for me to imagine what it'd be like to not feel depression as that's been most of my life, with tiny windows of joy where it felt like my efforts to outrun my horrible background were paying off. Those windows have closed and even if there are others left to open somewhere, I don't care, because they don't even look like ways out anymore. I'm at the point someone could give me a million dollars and it wouldn't make me happy.

But guess what the worst thing of all is? You have a *survival instinct.* Living another day feels awful, but dying is still terrifying, and beyond that it's drummed into your head that you'll hurt people if you somehow think you might be able to overcome the strongest instinct of all. You don't even want to die, just for your reality to be fundamentally different, but that's obviously not how this all works.

So, you're stuck in this hell that's been aptly described like the mental equivalent to a burning building, and there's no grand purpose to it - there's no big meaning or reward for suffering through it - you just had really bad luck. You just happened to be the organism born to become self-aware within an absolutely shitty situation, to the point many people  objectively admit you were, and now you've got to either take it or leave it and both options feel pretty horrible, but one at least feels like a solution in that this whole situation simply ends.

The thing is, too, I bet if it was somehow possible for a person that feels normal, or god forbid, happy, to experience this feeling for a day, they'd totally understand wanting to leave it and be incredibly grateful they've never spent a day in the desperate void that leads one to truly consider suicide.

So, fuck it."
My post here had not a single like or comment. I feel so alone.,"I guess I really am the only one out there dealing with this never ending crap..people always say you're never alone, but they dont know what its like to be me."
I just called the hotline and got hung up on. Talk about feeling alone,"He answered and said his name. I said hello Kevin, how are you. He asked how I was I said “okay, I’m very sad” and I got the dial tone. Thank you very much, Kevin."
Why does living with depression just feel like a series of necessary distractions?,"Every single damn day I have to find at least one thing to distract me from the fact that I want to die. 

I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to suffer. I don't want to take anyone with me in the process.

I don't want to fail at it and end up with some kind of neurological issue or permament physical injury. 

I don't want to hurt the ones who care about me, either.  Like my parents. I love them. 


But I am just so damn tired of living.  It would be so nice if I could just fall asleep and not wake up.  

How nice it must be to not have depression. To not want to die.  I can't imagine how nice it must be going a day without fighting my own self..."
I tried to kill myself.,"Not today, not yesterday, 9 years ago. No one knows. No one noticed. I took a bunch of pills out of various bottles my family had lying around. Adderal, percocet, sleeping pills, and allergy meds were among them. I don’t know what else. There were more than four bottles. It was just whatever I could find. I swallowed some of each, chasing them with a wine cooler. Let a few dissolve on my tongue because I liked the sickening feeling they induced. I thought that would be enough. After a few minutes of nothing happening, I swallowed more. Got dizzy. Struggled to make it to the couch. Passed out. I was passed out in the living room and my family didn’t notice. They walked by me and didn’t notice. I still remember it all vividly and think of it often. I had no regrets. I wanted to die. Waking up, realizing I was still alive, that was the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. It put me in a daze. I’ve felt on pause ever since. I often regret not dying. I feel like I should be dead. I feel like a large part of me did die that day. The only reason I didn’t immediately try again was fear of not fully dying. I knew I couldn’t go through that again and didn’t have other resources I felt were adequate. I dropped out of school shortly after. I stopped leaving my house. I see all these stories of people living and being ecstatic over it. I don’t have that. Life hasn’t gotten better. I just wanted to tell someone."
I almost died yesterday,"I almost did it yesterday. I skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and I planned to end my life. I tied the noose and I jumped from a tree. Miraculously my neck didn’t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down. In that second that I was hanging from the tree all I could think about was how much of a mistake it was. I spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and I realized that life has its ups and downs but that’s what life is, you gotta live through the pain because it’s all experiences, not good or bad experiences, just experiences.

killing myself on jan 1st 2020,"my parents found out i have depression, now my mom is treating me differently while my dad takes on a more gentler and understanding approach. My mom is guilt tripping me and telling me to kill myself, she wouldn't care she said. So I was deeply hurt, I recently purchased a rope 2 hours ago online. I'm planning to write goodbye letters next to my ex-boyfriend who I always loved, my friend who I drifted apart with but our memories together haunts me, my best friends who stuck around me and helped me get better, which vainly failed. And of course, my dad, I love my dad very much. I already wrote a will 2 months ago. I told my classmates about my plan, and they all tried their best to make me feel better. I love them so much, but if I have to endure the pain everyday at home being discriminated and bullied by my mom... I just can't...

thank you for the people who showed concern, it made me rethink if i want to go through it or not. I just feel this way because everyday feels like hell and why even bother going on if everyone around you, including your old friends are happy."
Sick of hearing ‘it gets better’,"I don’t care!! 

I’m not only suicidal for my ‘temporary’ problems, I find life in general as simply meaningless and pointless. Even if things got better I wouldn’t want to live on this shitty planet, we all die in the end anyway. And my chronic pain isn’t gonna get better ever. I don’t want to change the world and I don’t care if people have it worse, so stop trying to guilt me."
Does anyone else feel destined to die by suicide?,"It sounds emo and cringy as hell, but I've felt this way for 8 years. Meh"
I'm still here,"2019 was filled with 3 suicide attempts and 4 hospitalizations. I'm pretty sure I spent almost all of my year wishing I was dead. Despite this, I'm getting better. I'm finally on meds. I've reconnected with old friends, and became much more social. There are some days where I feel like giving up, but I know I'm stronger than my thoughts. I'm managing, I hope you are too. Please stay safe."
Do you ever realize how easily you can exit someone's life?,"It's so strange, in under a year I've come to realize how easy it is to slip out of someone's life no matter how much you cared for each other before. It's comforting to think that these people will be (are?) okay without me, so nothing will be ""selfish"" about my suicide.

edit: Thank you stranger for silver, & to everyone else who understands this. Every ""you matter"" and ""you don't realize how much they care actually"" is very kindhearted of you to say but untrue in my circumstance unfortunately."
I've become so accustomed to the fact that I'm going to kill myself that other people's struggles with suicide don't register to me much,"Because I think about it so much I just see them as another person like me. It also makes me feel like everyone is like me, so if I went to kill myself and people were around nobody would care."
Should i commit suicide?,"Im a 13yo Male. My dad pressures me to get staight A’s and if i don’t he threatens me to beat the crap out of me. Because of the pandemic my dad stays home all day and constantly watch me doing homework and hit me and yell at me. I would usually avoid him at school, now that my safe haven is closed i can’t handle this anymore im considering ending it. Also please leave tips for painless ways of suicide. 

Sorry if my grammar is bad ,english is my second language."
I wish I could give someone else my life,"Some people are fighting to live , they are fighting death every day , it amaze me , wish I can appreciate being able to live but instead I wish to die as soon as possible"
I hate that you can’t even mention suicidal thoughts because everyone will freak out,"Even if you have them and know you won’t act on them. I get in phases where every time something upsets me I have very graphic images of all the ways I could kill my self. My OCD urges it on, and my irrational side tries to tell me it’s the best option. I have too many responsibilities for that ever to be an option, though, even if I have doubts that I’ll ever be “happy.”

But I can’t say this to anyone because they’ll freak out. They’ll think they should call a hospital, or tell someone in my family, or at the very least treat me differently or not let me tell dark jokes. And all those types of reactions end up doing are further isolating me in my own mind while pretending to be relatively fine on the outside.

Edit: This is my first time posting here and I am overwhelmed that my post has resonated with so many other people here. I hope to hear from more people. Please PM me or /u/ me in a comment if you’re interested in talking about something in particular (like someone mentioned OCD and intrusive thoughts)."
"I'm 15 years old, I will kill myself next week. I need help. I need to feel that somebody understands me.","Hi, for the people worrying, I have made a post with an update, I am so thankful for your support I love you all:
https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/e22l0a/update_im_15_years_old_i_will_kill_myself_next/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Please trust me, I am trying to describe my feelings in this post for almost 3 hours now. I need to post this. I will edit this tomorrow and do a whole story I just need somebody to know this. I don't want to die."
I don’t want to get “help”,No I don’t want to get better. In fact I want to get worse. I want to get so bad that I have no choice but to kill myself. Why would I want to get better if I want to die? Getting “better” will only slightly decrease my depression to the point where I still feel like shit but not enough to want to die and I’m sorry but that’s the opposite of what I want. I don’t want to dish out a ridiculous amount of money for someone to convince me that I should keep living this ridiculously expensive and worthless life for another few decades. Death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life. Medication and therapy might minimize it but it’ll never truly go away. The longer I’m alive the more problems will pop up and ending it right now is the only reasonable thing for me to do.
My daughter (14f) tried to kill herself last night,"To put it simply, I am so lost. This is the second time she has done something suicidal and I have tried my hardest to be there for her every step of the way. There are so many factors that go into this that I could type (on mobile) until my thumbs hurt. I am hurt. I don’t know how to trust her. It sucks so bad I just want to be there for her and twice now I have been informed by second parties that this has happened. I found her in the garage last night after taking a handful of pills. She was scared said she thought she was a freak. I told her I loved her no matter what. I consoled sisters and called grandmas so I could meet her and her mom at the hospital.  I told her I loved her, and now everything today is like normal. I am hurt. I am so hurt and I don’t want to put that on her. But I am tiered of emotional pep talks, and it hurt to know everything I’ve ever said to her didn’t help. I’m sorry for this thread.
I’m honestly overall just sorry."
Does anyone else think about suicide every few seconds?,"It's constantly on my mind. It doesn't matter what I'm doing. If I'm at work, or home or outside. The thoughts are always there. I'm talking about literally every 10-20 seconds I think about killing myself."
I fucking hate my birthday,You don't give a shit about me the rest of the year why do you pretend to care about me now ?? Every year it's the same and every year it's just a reminder that I haven't killed myself yet
"I killed my girlfriend, and now I want to kill myself.."," 

Before you read my true story, I want you to know that I'm not very good at English, as it's my second language so bare with me if I have made grammatical mistakes or anything, and honestly I really haven't opened up about this incident in my life, until today.

Anyway,

This one random late night in March 2017, I decided to download the Tinder app (probably the worst decisions in my life) , but I'm genuinely a introvert person, so it's hard for me to make conversation on spot to get to know people. Most people hop on tinder to troll, some to get laid but I was on it to find ""true love"". Fast forward to two months of most girls wanting to just party or I was to boring to form a conversation, this one random day I got super liked by this girl named Laura. We both started to talk, we both had a lot of similarities between us and she was literally 2 miles away from my place. It had been 2 weeks, we both still haven't meet but our conversations started to get more personal, and I felt a real connection between us two. We both replied long, it used to take me a good 45mins to an hour to reply, it was just how it was. It was however odd for me that she was really beautiful, and I was a ugly mf. She came from a small town family, where as me, I was a city kid, from a wealthy family (although she didn't know that for along time).

After the 2 weeks of talking, we both decided to meet up for lunch. Like when I say she was simple, she had no idea about brands or anything. I dressed up with some yeezy 750s, she didn't even know them. And some part of me liked that she was like that, because most of the times, I only wore to show off, to feel rich, to feel accepted. One thing about being rich is that, the definition of happiness is so different to what a average person would say. Like an average person has aspirations of having a nice house, a nice car, nice gadgets and all but it's different being born wealthy, like I had everything that anyone would aspire of having, it's different when you have everything. Anyway that just made me like Laura more because she was a simple person, a bit mysterious and I was always curious to know more about her.

We ended up dating for 6 months, and I knew she was the one for me, she was beautiful, she loved me for who I was, I didn't have to pretend to be this cool dude like I did with my friends, she loved the sensitive little bitch I was. Everything was going well, till (Jan 2018) she called and cried, her father was diagnosed with lung cancer at a bad stage, the doctors said they could cure it but he would only survive for a couple of months. Laura was going through some tough times, but I was always with her, trying to make her strong. She would tell me stories about her dad, like how they used to horse ride back when they used to live on farm lands, and how he would work 14 hours everyday just his both daughters could have the life that every other kid had. Tbh that got me so depressed, like the fact that her father sacrificed so much for his kids and all. But no matter what had happened over the next few months, years or the next decade or so, i said to myself that I would always be with Laura, and I wanted to marry her.

We got back to our casual routines, she was getting better and better, and on her birthday 11th of March, I proposed to her, I honestly didn't know if it was the right time or not, but I felt like I needed to tell her that I'm gonna be committed and not just saying it but i wanted to show her. Laura said yes, cried and hugged so hard that I thought she would break my bones, but I knew that this meant a lot to her.

April 11th 2018.

This part is going to be hard for me, as I am typing my fingers are twitching, I'm really scared, because to say it out is something i haven't done... Anyway, on this very day, I picked up Laura, we were driving to the hospital to visit her dad, we went on the highway. Till this high speeding car (prolly doing 150kmph) tried to overtake a vechile in front of us so we were behind this car, but suddenly suddenly the person slammed the brakes and dropped back, causing me to smash into the car. After this moment, I don't remember a thing. It felt like I died, I could hear my surroundings but I couldn't see anything, Idk how long or anything I woke up and the first thing I asked was ""what happened to laura?"" and my mum started to cry but i thought she was crying for me. I kept asking, and no one replied. Then it hit me, it hit me that she's not alive, and i couldn't understand. It all happened in a flash of a second.. The love of my life was gone, and I could do nothing about it, i didn't know how to take it in, it fucked me up. I only had minor injuries, but I was mentally dead.

Fast forward to a month, I still was in shock, infact I still am.. I went to visit her family, to apologies, but couldn't even let out a word, just cried out loud, but somehow they understood my pain. Laura's dad seemed to be weaker, her mum always had a smile on but she looked so bad, she was in shock and it just made me feel worse and worse. A week later, I found out that Laura's dad had passed away, i wasn't ready for the funeral, I didn't go to laura's too because I couldn't accept it but my mum told me that I had to go to comfort her mum. But laura's mum had completely changed, she didn't want to hear anything from anyone because two of the most people in her life had passed away and I honestly could do nothing but cry looking at her.

Fast forward it to now, there hasn't been a day I felt that I could have done better, I could have reacted better, and if i had turned the other way, maybe I could have died instead of laura, maybe she survived she could have been with her dad for the rest of time, maybe seeing her daughter would have kept him alive for a bit longer, maybe the mum would have been brave having her daughter around. I know it's not my fault, i've heard people say that constantly, it's not fault bro"" but I could have done better, to prevent it, and that is stuck in my mind, and always will. I honestly have no hope for life, I just want to die, i can't get over these thoughts, I just hope I die real soon.... It's not that I want sympathy but I just can't deal with it, it hurts."
I don’t want to live without him,It’s been 8 years since my fiancé was murdered in a robbery gone bad and I wish I could say I’m better but I’m not. I’ve hated my life every moment of every day since he left. I hate this world for taking him from me over something so stupid. I was born to a family that doesn’t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now I have to live the rest of my miserable life without him. I’ve prayed for the courage to end it all. I’ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I don’t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. I’m not over my fiancé and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I don’t want to live with this pain anymore. I’m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren. My life is a waste and means nothing. I wish someone would shoot me in the head too 😭
Please read this if you have the time.,"I'm really hoping somebody sees this, even if that seems selfish.

Maybe this isn't the right place for this. I'm new to this whole Reddit thing, so I was pretty shocked when I found this subreddit. the world is pretty crazy these days, I guess. I have no clue how many people will see this, or if anyone will see it, but I just need a place to vent. So, here's a not-so-short summary of my entire life story.

I was born at a very young age in Korea to a woman and a man (who already had another child, my sister) in a crippling amount of debt. I moved to Canada after a couple of years of living in Korea, my father's irresponsible investments and petty crime following us from across the globe.

I was four when my mother hit me for the first time. I don't remember the particular instance, but it was then for sure. To me, it seemed as if my mother would go out of her way to hit me whenever the opportunity arose. ANY opportunity at all. She would beat me senseless for not cleaning my room or eating too slow, or whatever other trivial matter she felt like punishing me for. There have been far too many instances in my life so far, where I, an innocent child, has cowered at the hands of her mother, thinking it was the end. She has made me fear for my life on numerous accounts.

I was in the third grade when I called my mom a bitch for the first and last time. I just remember being so insanely frustrated with the way she treated me, and the way she was so much more accepting and lax when it came to disciplining my older sister. I muttered it with seething anger on my way out the door that day. She called the school I was attending at the time and told them I was ""sick"". She kept me home and beat me with a metal music stand, aiming for my head, my throat, and just about anywhere else she figured she could land a blow. This went on until my barely present father came home from work. I was sent to school the next day, being given a kiss before I left as if the day before had never happened.

My school performance was never awful. in fact, it was more the opposite. I was considered somewhat of a child prodigy. School was the one place I felt I could truly thrive, if ever. I did have what I would consider seriously awful behaviour in school, as I would lash out at other children with the same violent tendencies as my mother. This was not brought to anybody's attention, so for a very long time, which means it was not corrected until much later in my life.

The (abusive?) cycle kept going the way it was, with her beating the shit out of me for the sake of discipline, and then acting if she was some sort of saint the very next day, with not even a hint of guilt or remorse on her face. I remember being in the fourth grade, sick of being ""disciplined"". I picked up our landline and looked her in the eye,

""I'm going to call the police and tell them everything you do to me."" And she said,""Go ahead, nobody is going to help you."" I felt completely defeated. There was no help for me. There was no escape. Even at the tender age of 9, I started to feel as if there was no escape but death. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about this. 'Mom would probably hit me again.' 'Dad is never home.' ' I know she wouldn't get it.' I knew that if I talked about it at school, that legal troubles were sure to ensue, so I kept my mouth shut for a long time.

Another memorable instance happened in the fifth grade, when my mother fell insanely ill out of nowhere. we were at the pool. She seemed to be completely fine just moments before, but now she was seemingly dying in a changing stall, telling me to get her help over and over again. And I didn't. Call me a heathen. I stood right in front of the stall door and prayed with all my heart and soul that she would just die and leave me alone. She didn't. Some days I still wish that she did.

Fast forward just a little more. There I was, a tender 11, resentful and bitter at the world. I didn't give a shit about anything. I just wanted it to be over. My school performance started to slip, I just couldn't understand like I could before. Anything and Everything was insanely distracting, and I took to watching anime and gameplay videos as a means of escape from the world. Somehow, my hungover teacher would still find any excuse to give me a good mark, and I was still considered a prodigy, despite my near fail scores. I couldn't do math to save my life, but because of the way I was treated, I would chant to myself 'at least I'm smart' to make me feel better about it all. I was accepted into an academic challenge program for junior high, which only further inflated my ego.

When I got to my brand new school, I realized a couple of things: 1. Years of being violent towards my peers left me completely unapproachable. 2. I had extreme trust issues. 3. I was fucking stupid compared to my peers. I so badly wanted junior high to be my break, my way out. I wanted so badly for everything to get better. But I couldn't make any new friends (probably because I was terrifying, we're talking descriptive death threats left and right) and my academics were not improving at all. Focusing was near impossible. I couldn't ever shut my mouth. Everyone hated me. I was at an all time low, and I still didn't have a single soul to tell this to. I couldn't trust those kids at school, they'd hand me over to the police like I was nothing. I never wanted that. I desperately wanted to put my past behind me. My mom had stopped beating me (only after figuring that her multiple illnesses made her weaker than I was) but it still felt as if she would strike again at any moment. I was living on edge at home and school. I managed to raise myself a little, teaching myself to trust little by little. Teaching myself what was morally acceptable. Anything to make me even one friend.

Eighth grade was somewhat of a breeze. I had friends, and people seemed to no longer think I was terrifying. But of course, in a cruel world such as this, nothing can ever be completely good. my grades were slipping hard. I procrastinated to the end of my life, and every assignment I handed in was complete shit. Things didn't really improve family wise either. My mom would be pissed at me if I was sick and bedridden, since that's an inconvenience to her. My dad was drunk every single day and my sister was starting to become a second mother. Definitely not ideal, but I would fight my way through it. look at what I had already overcome!

Ninth grade. shit. I realized that people didn't actually like me. To everyone, I was just a background character, nothing more than a forgettable nobody. I felt invisible, like I was talking and people just didn't even care that I was there. This is also the year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Family didn't take it well, or rather they just didn't take it. None of them have really bothered to look into ADHD at all, nobody asked the doctor any questions, none. Zip. Nada. My parents don't give a damn. They've made no means to learn about it. They just pump me full of what's essentially meth as medication and hope I shut the fuck up. They don't reprimand my older sister calling me retarded at any given chance. Nothing. It's awful knowing that because of this, I'll never be normal. Nevertheless, I kept working towards self improvement. I was making good progress. I really thought I had a shot at getting better and fully escaping my past-

nope. quarantine. I'm stuck at home with my family. My mom has definitely calmed down, but I know that deep down she resents me. Now, my sister is my biggest enemy. She truly is my second mother. She belittles me constantly, insulting me and disregarding me. Worst of all, she pretends she's a fucking saint, just like my mother. When I confront her about the things she does, all I get is a

""No I don't, I don't have any idea what you're talking about!"" And then she just keeps on hanging around in my room pretending like we're best friends, as if she didn't call me a defective retard the other day.

And here I am now, washed up at 14, unable to recover from my past. Broken forever. Defective. Stupid. Unmotivated. Invisible to the world. I want to end it all. I have nothing to lose. I am nothing. I purposefully omitted my current age until the end of the post because I didn't want people to think I was a ""sad girl"" or just a typical teenager. The more I read this though, the more I'm starting to think I am just stupid teenager who needs to be disregarded. My feelings are invalid. I hate myself.

If anyone is really out here, and I'm not completely invisible, please say something. I don't want to be alone anymore. I don't think I can do this anymore. I don't want to be alone anymore. Please."
the amount of people suffering here is insane,"do you sometimes realize that the amount of people suffering from severe depression and on the brink of killing themselves on this subreddit and outside of this subreddit really speaks the painful truth about our socaity and our world in general? the world we live in ladies and gentlemen are crule uncaring and cold
in this socaity we view the mentaly ill as an outcast an alien a very disgusting and unacceptable creature....which we pretend to care about and try to ""help"" them
if you suffer from cancer or any other illness people can actually acknowledge your pain and know you are suffering
they know how hug your scars are
but with mental illness people sometimes understemate your suffering
people understemate how severe your depression actually is
people say go get therapy, take anti depressiants but its not a 100% cure it never cured everyone((i myself took pills but it never worked))
actually depression and other disorders
never had a magical cure like we have on flu...yet we dont take it seriously 
and the result? suicide

i really wish depression was like a flu it could get away with some medicine
but no ...its like a curse...once you get it
its gonna never stop hurting you
only if its not too late and only if you got some huge will to live you maybe can get through it ...maybe
its like a snake ...eats you from the inside out
first it eats your will to live and then it eats your ability to enjoy things 
and finally when it really completely took over your mind and body ...it will make you wish for death and later on plan it
this snake feeds on neglect truamatizing events
and deep scars left unhealed...and we can only destroy this cursed snake with care , love and good treatment
not risk truamatize suicidal people with more shit...i swear people could never understand us and only the ones who suffer like us can only understand what if really feels like to have this shitty disorder...
if only people could at least show a bit of understand and care
we would'nt ever get to this point
that idea really makes me hate humanity and myself even more...everything bad happens to us is what we deserve 
we all cold and greedy
we all just take take and take
we never give
we never gave to eachother nor to this poor plant
we all deserve to die 
no one is good
if there is good left in us its only minor
god if you even exist please end us already
please end me...i dont want to see myself living inside this hell forever
the hell is in me and in the world
i can never fix myself nor i can fix the fucked up world
the best i could do is just die

edit : one day and this many upvotes? well i gusse there are a lot of people who get me , wow im not completely misunderstood for being a sick fuck!
thanks for you all ....you all are my shining hope in this darkness ...im lost here and trying to find my way out of here...
well at least the moment i die i could still think back and see i was never alone in how i saw this world"
The fact I'm gonna die from suicide in the future is comforting...,I'm not gonna grow old. I'm gonna be dead... I've been wanting to commit suicide for a long time now... If I can't take it anymore I'll just Kill myself
"""But you are so attractive you have no reason to have social anxiety and depression.""","I know it's not the correct sub but why the hell do so many fuckheads say that shit?

* Yes I have a mirror
* Yes I care about my hygiene and looks because I learned it that way and it's hard to dislearn something like eating with a fork and knife
* Yes I hit the gym every other day 

But why the fuck does that have something to do with my mental health?

I'm a male and it's already hard af to hide your feelings in public because of social pressure (at least in Germany) but shit like that is driving me mad if people think that being attractive makes you imune against depression and so on.

&#x200B;

Has anyone ever encountered shit like that?"
The gun jammed,"The title says it all. A little over a week ago, I put a shotgun barrel in my mouth and pulled the trigger. It didn't go off. The fucked up part is that I'm just sitting frustrated about why it didn't go off. I saw my therapist last Saturday and told him about it. He asked if I was willing to bring the gun to him for safe keeping. I complied. Later that day I checked myself into an urgent psychiatric center and they almost kept me. They prescribed Zyprexa instead and after telling my story, the psychologist started crying. That didn't help. The Zyprexa has made me feel numb. I'm not sad, and I'm not happy. I don't want to be alive anymore, or rather, I simply wished I didn't exist. Just needed to get that out. To anyone that reads this, thank you."
I died yesterday,I died yesterday and now for some reason my body is moving but I’m dead inside. Yesterday was it. I’m dead. I have nothing on the inside. No joy. No sorrow. No up. No down. No conversation. Nothing. I am a body that’s waiting for death whenever that may be because I’m already dead.
i didn’t ask to be alive,"this isn’t a gift, why does everyone say it is?"
I hope there isn’t a afterlife.,"I can imagine the bliss of not existing. The void of nothing. The thought of never ending unawareness and peace. We all die and the endgame is all the same anyway, so to me, why not now?"
Attempted suicide a few hours ago and I'm shook and so scared.,"I've been at my all time rock-bottom for the past few days and I've been crying every night. It all accumulate this morning when I tried handing myself after my parents left for work. 

It's left me absolutely shook. Even writing this I'm shaking and my breathing is unnatural. I'm so scared, I'm really fucking scared. This is my first attempt so I've never felt anything like this before, the tears, the shaking, all of it. I can't stop crying, I can't believe this is real. Who knows if I'm gonna even be here next week, the way things are going I'm unsure, and this frightens the hell out of me.

I've had a therapist for the last 6 or so months and it really helped, but as soon as I stopped I instantly when back into my depressive state. I don't want to be stuck talking to a therapist my entire life. So I haven't been back and I don't plan too. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much for hearing me out, I just had to say this, I feel sick after what's happened.

Much love to everyone out there. Together, we'll get through this, all of us.


EDIT: Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this and especially to those kind hearted and uplifting comments. I am pretty worried about everything that's been going on with myself but reading the comments has helped to calm me down immensely. Honestly I can't thank you enough."
I'm afraid one day I'll just snap and kill myself,"To be honest every time I'm angry or sad my mind goes to suicide. Even the smallest things: an argument, missing the bus, anything. And I'm just scared one day I'll get so mad or sad I'll kill myself. It's been like this for a year or two, but it keeps getting worse. I'm just so scared. I feel bad because other people have it worse then I do, but I'm just whining and afraid. A friend told me ""other people's worse problems don't mean you're problems aren't bad"" but I'm just so scared"
"No one will see this but if you do, thank you 🖤","I’m at home with my mum (who is asleep), usually my Stepdad is home too but I told him that my uncle is coming round, with even some false proof, he believed me so he has gone to his hour or two work shift. 

I did it so I could cry on my own, contemplating kms, because for years, since I was about 8 I have been thinking about it, getting stronger over time. I am always paranoid, looking around every corner, everyday contemplating. I just want it to end, so much has happened, people think I have it all, but it is all just a lie. About once a week I look up to see what the quickest way to kms is, to see if someone came up with a new and easy way. 

People say that I’m not alone, they all do, but these days I believe I really am, they say don’t do it. I have ambitions in life, but I know that I will never complete them, I will be gone soon and I know it, never having done any good except a few occasions when I made my family happy. I know what could have been, but now, right now, I’m a waste of a life and there is no reason to go on.  I suffer so much, I have no hope but I know things that I want to do in life, things that I want to see, places that I want to go to, people that I want to meet, but I am literally on the edge. They say call these numbers, go to these groups. They to me are worth nothing. I really wanted to live, but I can’t suffer like this anymore.

Sincerely, Kris"
I wish there was a reset button for life.,I wish
Goodbye,"\*\*UPDATE: I didn't do it. I made myself go to sleep. I didn't get all my letters/goodbyes done the way I needed to. Right now I feel empty, in a daze. I know I will lose this battle one day, but I'm kinda glad it wasn't last night. Also, thanks to all the people who commented that they care, means so much.\*\*

Hopefully, this is my last post. I'm not posting this for attention or pity, it's merely to show I was here, I was a person.

Right now nothing and everything hurts at the same time. I can't breathe, I can't stop crying. Why am I this weak, it's a disgrace to humankind.

I can't take this anymore. I'm sorry to all the people I love, even If the love was not returned.

Thanks for the memories life. Goodbye.

Nobody genuinely wants to help you in the real world,"If you start getting depressed or lash out, first thing they'll think of you is you are dangerous. They'll look for a solution in mental institutions, medicine, restraining - anything to keep you from doing harm. 

They'll call you selfish for bringing hurt to them by trying to solve your own hurts. To them, you should suffer in silence and never exist.

The stories in the movies, books, etc. are all wrong. Humans are selfish, first and foremost. Jesus does not exist in real life. And no, he will not come to comfort you or understand you in your darkest moments. Nobody will, that's why it's just a myth.

To them, you're just an animal. A human turned into a zombie, that needs to be taken out. Your emotions aren't valid responses to your environment. To them, you are broken."
FFS I can't accept the reality of how society works,"No matter what. How the F do people accept it? It's just a giant working camp, where ruthless gestapo is being praised and prisoners accepted their fate and just live day by day.

Empathy is considered weakness, because profit at all cost is all that matters...

I just can't pull myself by the bootstraps, suck it up and enjoy this dumbshitfuckery. I just can't. 

Checking out early is all I could think of lately."
I want to kill myself. I want to die. NSFW,"**trigger warning - talk of sexual and physical abuse.There is no TL DR, I need to vent. I've never told anyone the entirety of my life. I never wrote down how I felt. I want to see if it helps.**

&#x200B;

I was physically abused by my father. I remember one time he slammed/pushed the kitchen table into my chest while I was eating dinner. It pressed my chair up against the wall, then pushed all the air out of my chest. I remember getting tunnel vision and hitting the floor limp, as the table was pulled away.

When I tried to get up, while on hands and knees, I was kicked in my stomach by him. I don't remember anything other than being on the couch and my mom leaving him after that with me and my 2 brothers. I was 8. This is ONE story.

&#x200B;

My great grandfather used to call me worthless and emotionally abuse me because of my ethnicity. Until I was in my 20's I was reminded daily about how worthless I was over something I had no control over. He basically stepped in as the father figure. I would spend my summers in Southern California helping him super his apartments until I was about 17.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was also sexual abused.

&#x200B;

I have never told anyone this, I was raped.

&#x200B;

To me, those are two separate things. When the abuse started, I physically enjoyed it. Had no idea. Then I was brutally sodomized. Then I grew up just a little and that's when I started to hate distrust and not like anyone. I built a fake smile. I built an auto pilot response for everyday things. I don't think. When I can, I do what I can to stop.

&#x200B;

From the ages of 9, to about 14 I was fucking raped weekly by a boy 7 years older(We'll call the fat ugly rapist FMC). I felt like shit because at the start I liked it. I didn't know what was happening to me, I just felt. By the time I was 12, I started to feel disgusted. By 14, I fucking hated everyone. I don't care to discuss the last time he abused me but I will say I don't think he EVER put himself in the position he was in. He left me alone at that point.

By the time I was 18, I was wrapping up making money by taking it from adults to beat the shit out of under age people I went to school with (gang related and they didn't want to get in trouble, and hell whats the worst that could happen to me if I get caught? I was a minor), they all deserved \*this is just how I felt at the time\* it and it was my only outlet. It was shit like, kids stealing and the owners wanting revenge cause a family member seen them with the stolen property at school. Or someones dad wanted me to scare the shit out of the daughters boyfriend. Shit like like that. The last time I did something like this for example - Some kid who was a senior ( over 18 at the time )had his stereo stolen. He gave me $50 to beat the shit out of the kid who did it ( 16yo ). He reminded me of the boy who raped me. When I punched that kid, all I could see was that fat piece of shit FMC. When he was on the ground, in the fencing position, I drug and slammed him around by is hair. Into the side walk. I picked him off the ground, while he was dead weight- and rubbed his head in the top of a chain link fence. I was expelled and arrested for assault. I tested out of High school. I have never ever been violent with ANYONE since then. All the way till now and I'm 36.

During my time in School, seventh through high school, I hated everyone. Fuck em. I had only 1 real friend and I had one crush on a girl. One. It lasted no less than 2 weeks of fantasizing before FMC learned about it. He didn't like it. He told David my best friend at the time (he had no idea FMC was fucking raping me and new him as a friend of my family) that I had made out with her. He knew David liked her. David, pissed from hearing this, asked Christian. Of course she denied it. It never happened, it wasn't true. I was now known as a Liar. She went to church and school with me. I was 13 at the time, so from grade school right on through to high school, if I went to church with you or school, I was a liar. So the one girl I've ever liked now labeled me and to everyone else a liar. My best friend, no longer, because now I'm a liar. This was what happened the first time I ever told another person I had FEELINGS twards someone else. One little bitty crush. Now - No social life. Destroyed. Home life also. Behind the scenes is a literal fucking hell. I liked girls. was being raped by a 300lb+ fat fucking boy. I hated FMC, after my last altercation with him I was close to or at 15. About a year goes by. No girls look at me. Small town. I don't like them, because they hate me, I lie about making out with em. I wanted to have sex though. To be clear, I wanted to fuck. I had been fucked. I wanted to have joy... Just once... So I had a plan. When I was around 16, doing the summer Super Job for my Grandfather, I paid a prostitute for my first sexual encounter that mattered because I wanted to know what sex was like with a woman. When I got back to Northern California after the summer job at gramps, I told my older brother and he called me a liar. I never told him anything personal up until recently because of that. now my family thinks I'm a liar, and hates me to.

&#x200B;

So at this point I am 18 and I fucking hate everyone. My dad also starts developing a mental disorder. He slowly is becoming mentally disabled. I figured, fuck him. Some karma.

&#x200B;

I decide to move out. My cousin, she moves in with me. I was growing weed at the time. Played video games. Didn't think.

She and I connected. She was the first person I ever felt ANY affection for. She didn't want to use me. She didn't want hurt me. She wanted to know why I was hurt. My head at this point of my life is just so fucked I think/confuse that with her romantically liking me. I did my best to sleep with her. She out of guilt, w/e let me. She knew nothing about my past for the most part and we did not grow up together.

I knew her from the age of 1-5, then met her again when she was 17. I, out of the fucked up need to want to be wanted by the ONLY person I actually had confused feelings for manipulated or talked or w/e my cousin into an incestuous relationship. I wanted to kill myself. I kicked her out of the apt. She moved in with my older brother and had a sexual relationship with him for about 3 years. I felt I was the one that fucked her in the head enough to do that.

&#x200B;

I was going to kill myself.

&#x200B;

My grandmother, the great grandfathers daughter had bad arthritis. She was a chef. So I learned to cook and take care of her. I learned that I enjoyed people eating and liking my cooking. This was the first time I felt ANY joy from someone else. People. My grandmother died when I was around 26. she killed her self, the pain was to much. I hate saying this but, I didn't really care. I love her... but I didn't care. At least she wasn't in pain....

&#x200B;

I felt nothing for anyone for a good period of time. No love, no hate.

&#x200B;

So until about the age of 27, I got hit on multiple times. I am not unattractive I guess. I was in 8 physical relationships in my twenties. 2 I sorta developed feelings for. I never asked any of them out. I never once told them I loved them. I never lied to them or cheated. They asked me out, they persude me.  Sex was a chore. I love sex in my head. I love to  masturbate . Watch a healthy amount of porn. But actually having sex..... ugh, I would rather  masturbate  tbh. Everything sex reminded me of two things, the only person I care for and still love like a sister now, my cousin; which makes me sick to my stomach because I felt I manipulated her into doing something horrible, and being raped in the ass by a big fat piece of shit.

With porn at least I can choose any nice loving thing that I want. I like scenes where you can tell there really into each other...  And I don't have to think.

\`

At 28 I was in love for the first time.  Met her at work.

&#x200B;

She started everything. I mean EVERYTHING. She broke up with her boyfriend AT work. Asked me out in front of him the next week. For 6 months she was in a relationship with me, for 6 months I thought we were together. For 6 months her and her old boyfriend who she was in a relationship with for more than 5 years at this point, used me to further his cuckold fantasy. When I found him literally in the closet one night in MY FUCKING APARTMENT that she snuck him into that day at what time I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, jacking off to me fucking his girlfriend who I thought was with me, I flipped out. My life is insane, WTF IS THIS SHIT. Melony thought I was going to kill them. I might've. She left, both naked, with my blanket, peeling out of the parking lot. I quit that job the next day.

&#x200B;

I want to kill myself. Have it planned.

&#x200B;

My father develops a bad health issue, compounded with his now mental age of around 7, his health his slipping. fast.

&#x200B;

I move in with him, the state pays for me to take care of him. I do nothing but play video games and smoke weed. I'm waiting. I tell myself, ""When he dies. I go to.""

&#x200B;

At 31, I leave the house maybe once a month. My older brother decides he wants to reach out cause I'm a ""little"" closed off. At the age of 32 He includes me in his hobby. At 34, I turned it into what might now be a carrier. I still take care of my father. I am not so sad anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm 36, I'm doing well at the job I can make into a career. I met someone. Another Co worker. And for the first time, no confusion, I have a full blown crush as an adult. She's nothing special to look at. Not ugly in any way. But my god the personality, her choice in music, so many things in common. Thinking about her makes me smile. She initiated the flirting. We chatted for hours and hours for weeks. This did not happen over night. She has been there for 7 months at this point, and about 2 attached at my hip when she had free time. Also the subjects she would bring up. She was very much flirting. So of course I tell her. No way can I have any regrets.

&#x200B;

So today I come into work and she makes no eye contact and shuts her office door. Witch is not normal. I ask her if I can talk to her about something later at lunch. We get ice cream some times together so I figured that would be the time. She just avoided and left me standing there after I asked if we could talk later. Didn't answer. So I asked her at the end of the day. Told her how I felt, and the last thing that I wanted was for her to feel weird at work.  Then she told me she has some one, and it's ""complicated"". I am almost positive, she likes another coworker. I see them text each other all the time. Didn't think anything of it till today. The thing is, yesterday I mentioned I might ask her out the next day joking around when I seen the other co worker in the parking lot, the one I think she likes. He doesn't work in the building with us. Hadn't seen or talked to him at all today. He Laughed when he seen me today at the end of the day when we clocked out. Pretty sure he told her the day before, it made so much sense after I thought about it. The way she avoided me.

&#x200B;

She wants nothing to do with me. Went from conversations, her staring at me when she thought I wasn't looking, to her actively avoiding me at work. In just one day. I went from feeling again. I went from finally feeling like I can open up to someone. I even entertained being normal once. I felt again for someone else ONCE MORE. This time it wasn't misplaced I told myself. I should have listened to myself when I told me not to even think like that. because it wont happen. It won't. Never in my life will I ever find someone that wants me for me, not to use me. Never in my life will I want the person that does. I will not be happy.

All I want for my coworker is to be happy. I don't think in any way that anything on both parts was malicious. I think it's just terrible timing. Or this is hell.

&#x200B;

I think I'm done. Thinking about headed to sleep.  I will check tomorrow to see what people have to say if anything... All I know is, I got to feel for once, and what I felt was what people do normally. I couldn't even once in my life have one thing ONE fucking thing normal. I can't be happy I guess. Fuck this world.

UPDATE- I made it home from work. While I was at work I felt comfortable enough to talk a LITTLE to a co - worker. Gave him a little perspective and the day was less award than I thought it would be. he helped just by listening. That being said, she still locked herself in her office all day so there was at least not to much awkwardness. Didn't have lunch with everyone witch is very unusual for me and left a little early so we didn't have to leave together. I just want her to feel comfortable at work. It's not her fault at all. Also everyone at work knows. Everyone including both my bosses thought the same as I did about my co-workers interest in me. One even asked the girl I liked I guess, ""how long do you think it will take before you two hook up?"". So I guess my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. Just wish she didn't play games. All I know is I can't choose how I feel and I bet she's no different. So I am just going to be myself for right now. Do what I do. Don't think, just do. But fuck, I'm still so fucking tired of being nothing, feeling nothing. At least today I felt like shit =) I mean, that at least is something...  


Another thing I will add is my older brother and I have different fathers and my cousin is not a blood relative of his. "

Got fired for taking a dump,"I worked at health department on contract, I have a bad stomach so every morning after thumbprint and attendance being confirmed I ran to the bathroom to take a dump.

' and I said taking a dump, and then he said well you didn't asked for my permission ( I usually didn't but there was never a problem) and I said I don't see a issue here because go every morning, he got mad because I answered back and fired me, now I have rely on saving during this quarantine.

"I asked last Saturday if ""Anyone there"" ? You answered. Thank you. I was half way through my suicide attempt.","I was on this site last week and need someone that I didn't know.  I'm not doing well lately. I have a toxic abusive relationship, I cannot find a shrink to save my life (Literally. ha), I'm going through a divorce, my soul mate died (dog), I'm having to move states, find work, find a new home, and am living with my parents as of my psychiatric hospital release the day before yesterday.

I had been half way through, and had 2 methods essentially.  I took a medication to make it so I wasn't scared to do it. In the closet I was in, I had my phone, I'd already filled out my suicide note, and dictated in my legal will and burial details what needed to be done. I wanted to go forward.  I can't now, but think if it were again ... I would have not called for help but just let one of the methods run its course and go to sleep. I wouldn't wake up again. I am still ok with that idea.

I stood in the closet and had a fraction of a second that I was sobbing trying to pump myself up and asked if anyone was here.  It didn't save my life, but it gave me a second to think that wasn't thinking about the problem, it was writing and reading. I put \*\*\* \*\*\* down. I called my husband (STBX) and was taken by ambulance.  I was put in a hospital for a 5 day week and am now at my parents house. Everything is locked up, I have no access to anything. I don't have my car. I'm safe.

but Thank you. I wanted to tell someone what happened. I need to feel less confused about it and why or if I'm a risk, or if I'm being dramatic. I can't tell. But I can't talk about it at home. I'm sad and embarrassed to be here.

I tried to hang myself and I’m not handling it well,"Yesterday I tried to hang myself from a bridge with a belt and when I jumped I instantly regretted it. I fought with all my strength to hold on to the rail, but the belt was chocking me. I tried screaming for help but my voice was too hoarse for anyone to hear me. Eventually my arms gave out and I started to dangle and suffocate. I saw people in my life that had died and I saw all the great memories of my life flash before my eyes. Right as I was about to “go out” my leg began to swing up and reached a ledge. It was my last strength. I pulled myself up with my remaining core strength and leg strength so that I was parallel with the bridge. This gave me room to breath again. I swung my arm up and around the rail so that I could attempt to take the belt off and I knew I only had one shot at this. I was successful, but my body gave out after the belt was free and I dropped into the water. The next day (or today) I have been reliving the moments that seemed to be my final moments and other PTSD symptoms and I’m not sure how I can deal with it. Anyone have anything that could help?"
"i really wanna hang myself rn. Im not going to do it, but i really want to","im not feeling good this morning so im cutting up my leg rn ): but it happens u know


sometimes things suck and u gotta cutt

*edit: hey, i noticed the comments have been getting spicy and i would like to put my thoughts here instead of repeating them in the comments-

please DONT comment something along the lines of ""i care about you"" or ""i love you"". we are strangers on the internet. you dont know me, i dont know you, we dont know them. that means nothing to the receiving end.

please DO share your own experiences and how they may compare or contrast! i and others would much rather like to hear that we are not alone. theres also no harm in wishing others well rather than telling them things WILL get well.


also, please dont be toxic to each other. i can handle toxic comments, but idk other people's headspaces right now and id rather this post be a chill space than a nasty one. 

thank you.*"

No one understands what it's like to be gay. How shit, unfortunate and depression it really is. You're dating pool is nearly non existent so you most likely will never find someone, even if you do find someone you cannot ever create a real, traditional, biological family with them. Before any of this, you have to deal with homophobia, realizing you're a worthless dissapointment to your parents, that you betrayed them. 

This is how i feel every single day of my worthless life. Every single day. I'm sick of it. I want to kill myself."
"People say this feeling is temporary and it will pass, but I have never experienced sustained happiness.

I fucking hate my selfish pathetic parents for putting me on this earth. I did not ask to participate in life. I did not consent to be effectively forced into wage slavery and then eventually the terrifying experience of death.

I wish someone would shoot me to death.,"This morning my dad went on a rant about how people who don't add anything to society should die. All I could think about is how that's just me. I'm useless. I'm unwanted. I might not be a convicted criminal, but I'm definitely never going to be useful to society. 

I don't agree with him in any other case, but in my case... Yeah. I should be killed. 

I can't get enough courage to do it myself, but I still very much want it to happen. 

I can't see a day when I'll not be like this. Useless and suicidal. These are just two things that I'm meant to be. I don't want to be them, but here I am.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

&#x200B;

I have become a stupid dumb ass uncultured loser and i deserve to die. I deserve my peace. This is not me. You can have my life. I don't want it anymore. I am in hell and I want this to end."
"Have you ever been stuck in a cycle of “I want to live and give a big fuck you to people who kicked me when I was down,” to “I want to kill myself to prove a point” to “nobody gives a shit about me enough for either of those things to happen?”",I am leaning far more towards the last two. 
Depression has killed my brain,"Literally.

I can't learn or understand new things. I dont even understand basic and simple shit. It's so fucking frustrating, especially when people call me out for the retarded shit that I do and I can't even understand that. I can't do anything anymore. My life is completely devoid of meaning.

I'm thinking about dying, but I just dont know yet."
I quit.,"I quit. 

I can’t do this anymore. The world has gone to shit. My life is a mess. I can’t keep going anymore. 

I have no career prospects. No skills. No savings. No real home. No hobbies. No friends. There’s nothing to do and nothing to live for anymore in my life. Nothing to plan or to hope for. I’m not going anywhere and I’m sick of pretending that one day, somehow my hard work will pay off, because it never does and it never will. Fuck it all. 

My partner is a fucking nightmare to be with and is totally self absorbed and unsupportive. And swings wildly between a neurotic stoner who looses it like a skittish racehorse incapable of negating basic daily life or totally callous and cold and removed. No in between. She completely sabotages EVERYTHING I try to do for myself because she’s to fucking lazy and content with living like shit to make a change in her own life and ruins any resemblance of order I try to make for myself. 

I hate my shitty life. I hate the cunts I have to sit on the phone and “play nice with” selling shit they don’t need all day while being screamed at day in day out for less than minimum wage. I am rejected from every “good” job filtered and processed by AI I and pretend I want just so I can have a basic rate of pay that is financially viable enough to live off or god forbid, save. I looked at my CV the other day and I might as well have said, “fuck me up the arse for money” and I would have had better offers. At least then I wouldn’t feel so bad when inevitable some faceless corporation comes to emotionally, physically and financially fist fuck me in the name of profit margins and wildly conflicting agendas. At least I wouldn’t be so fucking surprised.

Everyday of my life is just one big joke. I put one foot forward and it’s just straight into the next biggest pile of dog shit. Constantly wading through piles of the next worst day of my life to the next. Pretending like one day it will be better but one day never comes.

I’m ugly, I’m fat and unemployable and scratch a bare minimum of making do throughout it all. Everything I love fucks up in the end and I hate where it’s gotten me. The vapid swirling vortex of fuck all. The purgatory of wearing this fucking mask, pushing boulders, breaking my back, tearing my nerves to shreds by the handful. Grating my bones to brittle twigs for some fat lazy cunt to get rich off of who doesn’t even know I’m alive. 

Then there’s the fucking world going to fuckkery... Honestly tell me what the point would even be anymore if I carried on and if by some miracle should somehow be falling out of my ass, why bother? Pretty much everyone is dying of this fucking virus or moronically trying to spread it further with their woowoo fucking cunt faced conspiracy shit or out of sheer ignorance desperate to give one another a death sentence via coughing fit. Even if that should somehow be solved within the next 6-8 months, the worlds still fucked and passed the point of no return, waiting for the seas to boil the life out of them, the ice caps to melt, the animals to rot from inside out and the world to goatse itself into a complete inhospitable prolapsed wasteland or, at best to wander around crippled by its change and ravage with mask and life support donned, picking our way through the mess for scraps.

Fuck me, even if the world doesn’t fuck us up, the socio-economic buggery will be the equivalent of throwing a brick into the middle of a crowded bar fight. Police and totalitarianism on the horizon, double speak, riots, food shortages, poverty, fake news, social unrest, the slump of everyday life as we know it cracking its skull on the wall behind and dribbling from its mouth as it sinks to its fucking knees.

I don’t even feel good about having kids anymore... What’s the point? Their lives will probably be worse off than my own. Maybe they too will bemoan and rue my “millennial” generation for their selfish, narsasstic, self-titled “irony”. Maybe they’ll find it in their hearts to forgive a generation of people who’s entire golden existence gave them the gift of the word “selfie” and social media that harvests their data for shady governments. Maybe they can overlook the fact that I cant afford to send them to school or home them in a house and feed them because I simply can’t make enough. 

What will I tell them when the end finally comes and they ask me “What did you do to stop all of this?”... What will I say, “oh yes darling I know we now live in a filthy pile of rags under a bin in a environmental nightmare but we had banksy make up a load of pithy little tee shirts to raise awareness and subtly undermine the futility of the modern world. Isn’t that great?!” And then we can all die from a poison gas cloud melting our lungs into grape jelly.

So what’s the point? 

Honestly? Can anyone give me a fucking reason because at this point, I KNOW it doesn’t get better or easier. I KNOW that my life will just be one lurch of shit to another. I KNOW that none of this can get any better for me, I’m ready to quit. 

I have some beta blockers and a beer, I don’t want to sit around and wait anymore. 

I can’t do this. I can’t hold on. I can’t make it better. It just doesn’t go that way for me and I hate it. I don’t want to suffer anymore and be stuck poor and making do anymore. I can’t. Everyday I am stuck inside and just waiting for the courage to not be a pussy and eat all the meds I have. Who knows I’ll probably fuck that up in the end too."
I'm deciding not to take my life.,"I feel like shit, I'm broke, I'm failing and I'm depressed, but fuck it, I'm not killing myself, I'm gonna workout every single day until i become a bodybuilder, and I'm gonna just fight this battle."
"Best friend killed himself, I want to join him","My best friend killed himself at the end of September, and I still can't handle it. I'm 28/f, and he was 30/m.

He was the most amazing person I had ever known, and he told me once last June about his plans to commit suicide. I tried to support him, but he killed himself months afterwards. I know that, as I was at the time, I couldn't be the reason he would want to live, but it hurts so much that he left me. He was the only one who would or could help.

I called him crying very late one night, when he had a test the next day at 8 a.m., and he came over and spent the night with me and then took his test on two hours of sleep, and aced it because he was a genius. How am I ever going to find a guy like him again? I loved him, but I never told him, and he died all alone, feeling like he was unloved.

I've cried every night since he died, wishing I could join him in death. I can't feel anything for anyone else. He made me feel beautiful and loved and cared for in a way I never thought was possible. Now he's gone...forever. I'm such a failure. I failed him. I never made him feel like he made me feel. He used to put his hand on my cheek, and tell me that I was the most beautiful and perfect girl in the world to him. Now, I pretend my pillow is his hand as I cry myself to sleep.

I failed him. I was insecure and had intimacy issues, and I never told him how he was the most beautiful man in the world. He was everything. He had led such a hard and tragic life, but still he found the strength in himself to take care of everyone he cared for, including me. When I told him my father had sexually abused me, I expected him to run for the door. Instead, he held me and told me that he accepted me and loved me no matter what, and that I was still beautiful to him. I'm sobbing, remembering the unconditional love he gave me.

I can't exist without him. I reach my arms out into the air sometimes when I'm trying to fall asleep, hoping I can feel his arms around me again. Why didn't I tell him that I loved him? Why did I assume I would see him again? I feel so guilty. I just want to feel his love again, and to smell him as he hugs me. He gave the best hugs in the world.

I just want to die and be with him again. I want to tell him that I love him.

Shane...I love you. I'm so sorry you died alone, and that I wasn't there. I'm sorry you died feeling like no one loved you, because I do. If only I had shown you what was in my heart, maybe you would have stayed. I'm sorry. I love you with all of my heart. I know you wanted me to live, but I can't without you. You were the only one for me, but I was too stupid to let you in. I'll see you soon, my love, which is the first time I've called you that.

- Cassie"
"If I test positive, I’m going to kill myself.","I’m getting tested on Saturday. It’s been a rough life, i cant finish highschool, my anxiety for testing for HIV is sky rocket, and I feel like a failure. Nothing in my life is going my way and I’m only 18. I havent been taking my meds (stupid i know) so i constantly worry about everything, and my suicidal thoughts are through the roof. 

I was sexually assaulted in June, he did put a condom on but that doesnt help or ease my pain and take away the fact that someone I trusted enough took advantage of my body and raped me.

I’m more suicidal than ever, my anxiety is off the roof and I’m scared to have sex again because I’m afraid that my rapist gave me HIV. I will never live with myself and I can’t tell my friends or the boy I’m talking to. I have nobody, no support and I’m afraid to go get tested on Saturday bc i hate needles but it has to be done.  If the test results come out positive, it’s the end for me bc nobody will love me and I’m just a dirty worthless piece of shit. I wish i never existed. And I’m in so much agony and pain and stress, my (then clear) face is breaking out and making me feel even worse.

I don’t know what to do and I’m scared and i feel hopeless. I feel like death is my only way out.

UPDATE 9/6/19: So today I found out he has a girlfriend who he got pregnant. And he already has a kid. So he has two kids now. My anxiety is a little calm now because I’m sure if he had HIV they would have it and so would their kid and knowing his babymother, she would have him in court and tell the whole school about how dirty he is. But it also makes me upset because he just has raw sex with any female and decided it was okay to rape me knowing he doesnt care about the consequences. I could’ve been that pregnant girl. I hope to god he used the condom correctly and that he doesnt have any incurable STD. But that still doesnt erase the fact that he abused my body and now I don’t love it anymore. I’m still disgusted by my body now and I feel dirty ashamed.

I wish this would all end. I think I might kill myself soon. I can’t focus on life rn when all of this is happening."
Never opening my mouth ever again,"Any time I talk about myself or how I feel to people or reach out for help I always end up messing up and ruining their day or making them annoyed or angry or just disappointed. 

No more, I’ll finally accept the approach where I pretend everything is perfectly great and nothing is wrong because keeping to myself is strides better than ruining someone else’s mood, they don’t deserve to deal with my bullshit and I don’t deserve anyone’s help and kindness"
I should have killed myself in high school,"I was a fool to think that things would change and that I would actually feel better when I reach college. I was so fucking wrong it’s not even funny.

Life only gets worse from here. I don’t want to be alive to see how it gets worse.

If I had known I would still feel this way by the time I got to college I would have hung myself freshman year of high school"
Who else feels like they're only still living to spare the feelings of their family members?,"There's nothing in my life worth living for anymore. Everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gone. I'm disabled, in poor health, I suffer abuse on a daily basis and I feel totally alone in this world. It would be a relief to be able to just stop existing. The only thing preventing me is the fact that I have 1 or 2 family members who I feel would be deeply affected if I were to check out on them. So I suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings. Anyone else in a similar situation?"
I'm addicted to the idea of not existing anymore,"It makes me feel calm, it makes me remember that, eventually, it will all end. See, I've been thinking about suicide since I was 15/16, I'm 26 and this is part of me. I'm bipolar, I have so many demons inside my head, even with meds and therapy, sometimes it's unbearable and then I start a travel inside my mind, where I think about the idea of not existing, I won't be here. The pain, the traumas, I'll become just a memory...But I also have to leave the good things behind, like my favorite music, movie, my cats...It hurts, it's like I'm running out of air for years, suicide is there, it is an option, the final one...At the end of the day I just want to quiet my mind, that's all I need.

&#x200B;

Sorry, just needed to write about this...and I think this is a safe place.

Edit: I'm glad some people can relate to this, we'll be okay, eventually. One day this will all end and we won't need to use suicide as an exit. Always remember that."
Why does every inconvenience trigger suicidal thoughts?,"Yesterday, it was a bad Surf session triggered by comparing my performance with others. Today, it was because the waves were too big for me to ride. I told myself I was lucky to even have the time and opportunity to surf. It eventually gets better with conscious effort to change my perspective, but then some other small inconvenience comes up and restarts the cycle. I want a technique to make it not start in the first place. I don't want to die right now, but I can't stop thinking how comfortable it would be to give up. I hate myself when I feel sorry for myself, which results in this crazy internal struggle, which overwhelms me and makes me want to give up. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks!"
Suicide is like a security blanket,The thought of suicide always gives me relief whenever I feel like everything is going wrong. I could easily get rid of myself and I would no longer have to participate in this shit existence. I can’t imagine actually growing old. I don’t understand how others can magically plan out their lives while actually having real goals for themselves and not once think about harming or killing themselves. It’s so foreign to me.
Alone,"We hug goodbye at the airport. You make your way to your boyfriend, waiting for you upstairs and I get into my cab. You're going home where you'll break open your bags and spill presents unto your mum and your boyfriend. 

I'll stumble into my house, lay my bags to one side so I don't trip over them then fall on to my bed. I'll pull the covers tight around me and at the back of my mind, pretend it's a hug. I won't think about tomorrow, how I'll need to get up and clean the house somehow. I won't wonder if I'll have enough strength to get up and cook myself lunch. 

While your family takes you to brunch and you tell them stories of our trip, I'll turn on the TV because the silence kills me. 

It's not that I resent that you have people. I just wish I wasn't so alone. I wish I didn't go back to an empty house all the time, I wish there was someone to say ""welcome home"". I wish that it isn't just Google for me to talk to at home. 

When I'm sick, I become so vulnerable. Broken body, broken spirit. The loneliness eats up at me even more and I wish I could smash everything around me, pick up a shard of glass and rip my skin open- let it out. Let out every thing inside of me, all my pains. Watch as the pain flows out of my veins.

I want to walk out to my balcony and sit on the rail. Feel myself sway in the wind till I find the courage to let go, to fall to freedom. Feel the wind knocked out of my lungs as I become empty empty empty of all the darkness inside my soul. The wish for my skull to crack open on the pavement then maybe everyone can understand how much darkness lives inside my brain. 

I want to breathe it in, any gas that slowly seeps away my life. To feel myself falling asleep for the last time and my demons lay down with me, we'll never wake again. The demons all nip at my heels as we make our way to hell but they can only run beside me, no longer a weight on my shoulders or pulling me in so many directions. 

If i have to be alone tonight, I wish it could be for the last time.

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger!! 
And thank you everyone for your kind words. I'm glad my piece connected with you all and sorry you feel such loneliness too."
i tried to commit suicide today,"The gun jammed... i dont know why,its like it didnt want me to die"
"Happy people telling you to just ""be positive""","Fuck them. They have it all sorted out. They don't know what loneliness is, what depression is, what anxiety is."
I don’t even cry anymore when I brainstorm ways to kill myself.,It’s been so long...
Anyone also getting suicidal thoughts when seeing happy stuff?,"Kind of a question rather than a suicide post but I just needed to get this off my mind.

So, whenever my friends send me cute stuff of their friends to them, or just happy/cute things, I immediately think about killing myself, and I'm honestly not sure why. Anyone else has them too?"
I'll be ignored again...,Nobody is going bother reading this but thank you if you do. I'm tired of being invisible. I just want to be cared. I'm tired of looking at an empty notifications screen. I don't remember the last time I went out with someone. Everyone around me is enjoying their lives except me. I don't want to wake up ever again if this is what it will be like for rest of my life.
See y’all on the other side ✌️,"This will be my first suicide attempt, hopefully it works.Taking a lot of stuff that will make me sleepy, I also have asthma and it will make it harder to breathe, I will then tie a bag around my head and sleep.


Edit: well I’m alive I ended up passing out from all the sleeping meds and some other shit for like 15 hours on my floor, I feel slightly sick but that’s it, I’ve read all the comments and appreciate all of you, I’m going to wait until the end of the year before I decide if I still want to die."
I wish I would die in my sleep,"I don't plan to commit suicide(i'm afraid that i might survive the methods and then i would be worse off), but every night I wish I would die in my sleep and every morning I'm disappointed I'm still alive."
Suicide is becoming a more and more attractive option each passing day.,"I don’t know what to say except that. I’m so fucking done. I’m not going to do it and I don’t plan to. But, even when I tell myself tomorrow is going to be a better day, it just isn’t and killing myself seems more and more an actual option."
Anyone else badly want a relationship but know it’s a terrible idea,"How could having a relationship be a good idea when most of us on this thread are probably really unstable, some getting their thoughts out, some contemplating ending it, some already having decided and making their last remarks.

I don’t think life has a meaning but I do think love is the closest thing that means the slightest to me. The only times in the last 3 years I see shimmer of light is when a potential romantic interest arises. The feelings are different to those of friends of family for me. Selfish to want it or engage when you sleep for 16 hours some days, don’t respond to meds and are very unstable. One day having made plans to end your life, the nest cancelling them. Being paralysed in bed another day. All those sorts of things make relationships unattainable and daunting for people like us.

So unfair and angering. Everyone deserves love, especially those who are suffering and suicidal. I feel we deserve it the most but we can’t feel it like other people because our mind is torturing us and convincing us we don’t deserve it. I’ve turned down girls for poor and unresponsive multiple mental illnesses. Will continue to do so until my health is stable which is as likely as me winning the lottery. Heartbreaking"
I'm Happy This Sub Reddit Exists,"It feels so nice that I'm not alone.

I know i'm not the first person to kill myself and I won't be the last. But it feels ""good"" that other people are having the same thoughts in this moment."
Is being passively suicidal a thing?,"I’m a 14-year-old genderfluid person, and I feel what I think I can best describe as passively suicidal. I have no intention of directly killing myself, but I just don’t have any will to go on. It’s hard to articulate, but I feel kind of like if, for example, a car hit me and I was, say, bleeding out, I wouldn’t call 911 and try to save myself. Is this a thing? What should I do?"
Do you guys fantasize about your suicide?,"I think about it a lot. Like I imagine how it'll play out.

 Who would find me, the mess it would make, how my apartment would likely smell of my decomposing corpse and how that would likely give away what actually happened. The process of distributing my stuff and the pain my father and boyfriend would be going through. My co workers finding out, how they would all act surprised and pretend they never saw this coming. 

Do you guys go through the same thing?"
Going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day,"I feel so lonely because I've never found anyone else who feels the same way. I have depression and ever since the really really bad times I've never quite related to any other depressed person. For example fake smiling (never had to do that unless I was on the brink of tears at school) I genuinely felt happy but I was still depressed.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

Anyone else feel like that? Or is it just me?

EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up. Thanks for all the comments. I truly appreciate all of them. Really!"
"Does anyone else feel empty, all the time?","I can't find anything that I enjoy doing anymore, everything just feels empty. I almost don't even feel human anymore."
I am not afraid of committing suicide,"I am not afraid of killing myself, but I think Sam afraid to disappoint people who believed in my nd thought I am doing okay.

but that wouldn't be the first time I disappoint people."
My secret suicidal thoughts are getting worse. It's getting harder to disobey. And I dont want to tell anyone,"I'm one of those super annoying people pleaser types. I'm constantly doing favors. Listening to other people's problems. And forever smiling and trying to keep the positive vibes going.

I'm worse than just all that though. Because im an airhead and I dont have good social skills. I'm always saying or doing something stupid. And it makes me more awkward. I act like it's all good and I'm happy and it doesnt phase me. But that is so far from the truth. 

Every single day I'm plagued by thoughts of how weak I am and how I'm annoying and how I'm a bitch and ""I need to die"" over and over and over. Which turns into ""I wanna kill myself"" over and over. It's getting worse every day. I dont expect help. I just needed a place to vent."
"It's not depression, my life objectively sucks","I'm 28, schizophrenic, probably autistic (can't get a diagnosis in Ukraine), live with parents, still a virgin. We are poor, our apartment is falling apart. I used to make music, but not anymore because it gives me insomnia (a weird side effect of schizophrenia medication). My psychiatrist is uncooperative and nasty. 

I have to avoid anything exciting (like music), so I sleep 15 hours a day if I can and browse sad subreddits the rest of the time. Can't focus on TV or books, feel restless because of the pills (a side effect that is more common than my weird music insomnia thing). I can't live like this."
Suicide is a solution to a permanent problem,"I’ll always be alone no matter what I try to do. Rejection hurts far too much and I’d rather be dead then have to experience it hundreds of times over and over again. I’d rather die than have to live life forever alone. I don’t give a shit if I’m young. I’d rather live a short life than live a long life of pain, misery and loneliness that only ends when I die of old age. I regret choosing not to kill myself in high school. The pain only persists and gets worse"
I wish my problems were normal teenager problems,"I want to be normal more than anything. I want to be grounded for sneaking out with friends instead of my parents desperately trying to make me get involved with other peers my age. I want to be tired because I stayed up late on my phone, not because I couldn’t sleep due to trauma. I want to cry alone in my room because I’m going through a bad breakup, not because I’m planning my suicide. Etc. I never feel like I can relate to other kids my age because our problems are completely different. It sounds bad but I’d give anything to be like everyone else"
If only dying were as simple as pressing “shut down” like on a computer,"So many years of pain I wouldn’t have to have lived through, so many more years I won’t have to be put through,

Jesus Christ someone please just stop it all for me."
The fear isn’t in dying. My fear is failing to commit suicide and the pain that I’ll feel as I try.,"If I had a gun it would be easier, but my only options  all require pain. I just have to get past the pain part and I’ll be good to go.

Edit: I really don’t care for what comes after I die.  I just know that it’s better than dealing with what’s here for me. Trust me, I’ve tried my best to keep moving forward in this world, but it’s all been pointless. I have no fear of being dead; I just struggle with the natural human instinct of fearing/avoiding pain. If there’s one thing in this life that I’m sure of, it’s that I want to die and it’s not a fleeting thought. I think about it the majority of every day.

The fact that so many individuals in the comments feel similarly is heartbreaking. Some of us are not fortunate or strong enough to go on living. Some of us have been beat down by life one too many times. I wish that was not the case, but unfortunately it is. It’s really saddening to see. But I sympathize because I feel the same."

Suicide hotlines are bullshit,They ask you the same robotic questions a complete strangers asks when they find out you want to die. Whether it’s texting or calling them it just feels awkward and I constantly have to watch what I say and lie otherwise I’ll have the police on my ass.
I just really wish I wouldn't wake up tomorrow morning. Or any morning for that matter,"I just want to say to you all, thank you. I turned my phone off for the day and went outside for a long walk today to help clear myself. It didn't help, but, it was better than the other thoughts that come across my mind throughout the day.

I got a gun to kill myself and my parents found out about it before I could do it.,"Hello, everyone. Pretty long rant ahead so grab something if you care to read.

I'm a 17-year-old dude, I live somewhere in North Africa, I've been dealing with mental illness for more than 3 years now. I'm kinda traumatized because of all the bullying I've been dealing with since I was young, I don't really get bullied now but I can get verbally hurt as I can't really deal with the other party due to the lack of my social skills. Anyways, I didn't have any chance to make a good long-term friendship in my short life. Mostly, they get bored of me or I just push them away. I decided to go to a therapist because those problems were affecting me in a very bad way and distracting me from studying. But it didn't help much since the therapist wasn't that good. I decided to cut myself and do other forms of self-harm, whether it's starving myself or purging whatever I ate, etc.. A year later, my parents noticed my unhealthy behavior and decided to take me to a psychiatrist, I was diagnosed then with Schizophrenia and Severe Depression, I began to take medications and they helped me a lot but the side effects were taking away a lot from me, my memory was and still pretty corrupted and I wasn't able to do everyday activity, in addition to blurry vision, vertigo, etc., I was in the last year of High School and exams came so I stopped going to the psychiatrist. I got a really bad grade despite doing my best, I stopped taking my medications cold turkey. I went to a below-average college and my mental state is really declining. I was able to get a pistol but my parents found out about it. My plan was ruined and I'm under some kind of suicide watch. I really can't take it anymore, just everyone telling me to ""Man up!"" and ""A lot of people are going through worse"", I'm also kinda guilt-tripped.

I just came here and wrote this from a throwaway account because no one really listens to me, most of my ""friends"" can't really be relied on, and I felt like taking this off my chest. Thanks to whoever read the whole thing."
im so fucking depressed to the point i even forgot why im depressed....does anyone feel the same way?,"i swear to god my mind is playing tricks on me

like really....i sometimes forget why the hell am i acting the way i do but then i remember why im this damn depressed
sometimes i really feel gulity being suicidal...im not trying hard enough for the people begging me not to do it....


""you're not doing anything with your life,you drop out of school and now your just a piece of shit lying on bed all day
your making your parents suffer with your weird behaviour, you did what you did because you are a lazy shit, you always say that life has no meaning yet you are not even trying to give it one
fuck you you really should die""


oh i remember now why i want to die...

Edit : oh god this is the first time having a reward on my post...thanks everyone for the responds thanks for explaing and relating to me,reading all the responds really cheered me up a bit
love yall"
I was born a hermaphrodite and I want to die because of it.,"I don't even know how to put all of my thoughts down properly here. I've been having terrible emotional breakdowns lately and I have no idea if talking about it will even help. All of the problems in my life are directly tied to a condition I was born with and how I've been treated because of it.

Based on what I know, when I was born my biological sex was ambiguous and doctors tried to have me surgically ""corrected"" into a female. My parents have denied knowing anything about it, but they refuse to let me have access to my medical records even though I'm an adult. The only reasons I have information about it are because of scars, genital pain, and hormone/ internal ultrasound testing from my gyno.

Nothing about my body is sexually correct. I have breasts, but I have male pattern chest hair and pubic hair. I have what should be a vagina, but it's actually just a small hole so narrow that I can't even use a tampon, much less have sex with it. I was born with a phallus, but they shaved it down until it was the appropriate size to be a clitoris. It hurts a lot now, even as an adult. Its like a terrible stinging sensation that gets so bad sometimes that it's brought me to tears before. I can't even touch the left side of it because it stings and burns so badly. 

I've always known that something was wrong about my body, even as a kid I knew that certain things weren't right and that I didn't feel the way that other girls did. My parents refused to acknowledge it and hid everything from me.

My parents were very rigid about gender roles when I was growing up and they punished me whenever I didn't behave like my forcibly assigned sex. Most of my earliest memories are of me crying because I was forced to wear dresses, makeup, and necklaces. I vividly remember begging my mom not to pierce my ears and spending my whole childhood wishing my ears would close up again because wearing earrings made me feel deeply sick.

When I got older, it just got worse. My parents wouldn't let me have hobbies or join clubs that they thought ""weren't for my gender."" they stopped me from doing even simple things like learning to play the trumpet. They refused to ever let me cut my hair above shoulder length and would only let me wear clothes that were ""girl colors"". If I did anything that deviated from what they wanted, they would scream at me and call me a faggot or a dyke. Even now as an adult living in their house they do this, and they've said physically threatening things like ""You're not too old for us to spank you."" 

When I turned 18 I started having serious medical problems. I ended up with an exceedingly rare kidney disorder from a hormone imbalance that came from the surgeries I was forced to have as a baby. I nearly died from it that winter, but still my parents told me nothing about my medical history. 

I didn't get diagnosed until I was 20, when my pain was getting so horrific that I had to quit school and my job. I went for my first visit to a gyno and she told me that I was abnormal. I felt like a complete idiot when she told me. My parents had always pulled  me out of sex ed in school, and I was raised in such a strict religious environment that I sincerely had never seen what anatomy was supposed to look like.

And I felt so broken and stupid then. 

I was so scared of what would happen that I didn't tell my parents anything that my doctor told me. I had been dating my boyfriend for years already and I was so scared to tell him that I waited months before I said anything to him either. 

I just feel like such a failure. I was never even remotely happy as a woman, but I know that my family, my boyfriend, and everyone else could never accept me as a man either. And I've never felt like a man in the first place. I've always felt like I was something between that, even as far back as I can remember. But I know that people could never understand that. Even someone as loving, patient, and kind as my boyfriend can't fully understand how deeply this hurts me.

I feel so completely alone in the world. I feel mutilated. I feel like a disappointment to my family because I can never be what they wanted physically or emotionally. I can't take the pain anymore either. I'm constantly peeing blood and my kidney feels like a knife in my back. I've been suffering from depression and dysphoria since early childhood, and years of therapy haven't helped me. 

I just want it to end. No more talk from my parents about how my entire existence is a sin. No more feeling like I'm a horrible mistake. And no more feeling like it's going to destroy my relationship and hurt the only person who ever truly loved me. 

I wish there were a way to fix this. I wish my parents had left my body alone and raised me in a way where I could have been myself. But now I feel so lost and alone that I don't even know who or what I am.
"
Casually suicidal?,"I would love for things to stop. Time to hold still and so slowly fade. Suicide will never be that peaceful.
I think abt death often. I don't necessarily have plans for life. I'm just patiently waiting for death. Like at a bus stop. I might read a book to pass time but my destination is so peaceful I can't help but to want to go there. 
I'm constantly afraid. Of everything. Feeling silence would be amazing

Point of this? Idk I never told anyone this cus they would worry but I feel like i need to. Don't worry tho~ most likely I won't be taking an active role. I've desired death even stronger than now and I've been too afraid. So.

Edit : thanks for the comments. Its nice knowing I'm not alone. If anyone would like advice since I'm just ""waiting at my bus stop"" doing what I can enjoy has been a great way to spend time. I'm in love with art. But hey if geeky stuff or insects is ur calling yo for it without shame. It's probably gonna be the thing keeping u alive"
Im going to kill myself in few hours .,"There is no other way anymore I have lied and been an idiot and a failure for my entire life . There is no turning back anymore and nothing can fix this . There really is no fixing this .

Edit: 
Thank all of you for reaching out . I wish the best for you all . Ive cleaned my room left a note and visited a friend im going to my (hopelly ) final  destination now , thanks and good luck in life."
I'm jumping off a building in a few hours to end my pain.,"I never knew the worst case of depression is when tears are no longer flowing in your eyes. Since last month, I've been taking high dosages of antidepressants hidden from everyone but myself. I had no one to rely on, my bestfriend gets mad whenever I speak about my anxieties, saying that she's afraid to be with someone who is mentally and emotionally unstable. I can't speak to my parents about how I feel because they just tell me that ""Everybody has problems"" and force me to keep going on with the routines I should be doing. I just want to shut down. I have no self-esteem left and I have never felt this way before. This is probably going to be my last reddit post. I left home earlier today ready to do this. I've been told that I'd go to hell when I die, perhaps it's time to go and check it out."
I want to die,"I want to die.
I want to stop thinking.
I want to stop hurting.
I want to die.

I just had to tell someone. Anyone. Because I can’t tell anyone else.


Edit: I didn’t expect this post to be so huge but appreciate everyone’s response, help and stories. I kinda made it through the night and talked to my therapist. The thoughts are still there loudly as ever but I don’t think i will commit suicide within the next days. Thank you everyone for reaching out to me. I hope you guys find hope and something to make your day better. Really. Thank you a lot. Reading all the comments and talking to some of you people helped me immense in distracting myself. I wish you the best. (I’m still here for anyone who wants to talk and wants to suffer together tho) please continue to help others in need"
Do you ever just want to talk to someone about your suicidal feelings but then anxiety grabs you by the throat and chokes you until you have a breakdown?,"I’m autistic so I’m very prone to the classic ‘autistic meltdowns’. I feel like my condition stops me from being happy and normal, instead I’m viewed as very weird and obsessive.

People in the past have scared me enough to barely talk verbally nowadays. I know if I were normal, I’d be happy and successful. No one will accept that my condition has made me a failure.

Yet I can’t talk about it to anyone about this, I just end up exploding and then overdose on my sleeping meds (nowhere near enough to kill me, but enough to knock me out pretty fucking hard).

I dunno, I’m a mess tbh! :)"
I plan my suicide 1-3 times per day,"if I get an urge to end my life while I'm at work, out running errands, with friends, etc., I usually zone out without realizing and think through exactly how I can kill myself after I leave that function. e.g. ""I can go to this store for a rope but they close at 9, so I'll have to leave early, then I can go here, so on and so forth"". 

Does anyone else have this issue ? I'll usually zone out for 30 seconds or so and people are wondering why I look all spaced out"
The love of my life killed himself three weeks ago,"Ive decided to go too. Nothing makes sense in this world without him it feels like I can't breathe. 

I really just needed to tell someone before I do it. 

Thank you all❤️"
Can you imagine being genuinely happy?,Free of depression and all of your mental illnesses? Just being completely normal and enjoying life and wanting to get old? Seems so unreal to me
Its amazing how people act so attention-seekingly on social media when people die. Its one of the reasons i wont kill myself.,"The subject speaks for itself really. I just cant get over how so many f\*\*\*ing worthless maggots would try to make my suicide a big  deal for them. Even in the face of the fact that none of them have have even cared the slightest bit about me or my wellbeing.

F\*\*\* those people"
if anyone reads this thank you,"I can't take It anymore. It's all so overwhelming & no one is listening. I've been practically alone my entire life, I dropped out of school In 8th grade because my anxiety was so severe I just couldn't couldn't go & no one cared enough to make me go. Which means i'm an actual idiot, like incredibly stupid. Honestly I cant even remember how to multiply or divide, It's humiliating. At that time my mother abandoned me along with my siblings at my grandmothers to chase after her boyfriend she met online 8 hours away.  Around this time I got really depressed & cried everyday for like 6 months. I barely ate & stayed inside my room all day with only a TV connected to a cable box to keep me company. I didn't see her much for a year after that. That is until she came back & took me along with her to this small town that I'm in now. I think I've spent all my time on the internet the last 5 years because I've been mentally incapable of anything else. Which means I can't drive, I don't have any friends, family or let alone a job. These are all things I've dreamt of practically all my life & they're so far away. It's becoming unbearable at this point. My mother & I aren't on good terms after she had to make my brother leave because he hit me & I called the cops on him. I don't have any money right now, absolutely no family, no friends & I live in a small town without any real opportunity's available. I'm living off my mother & the minute she decides I have to go I'm going to be homeless. Recently I've been begging her to take me to just get an id & help me apply for jobs. She keeps ignoring me & I know this is my problem but i don't have any money & I don't know what or how I'm supposed to do it. All I'm asking for Is just a job so maybe I can figure things out but I can't even have that. I fucked up & now it's too late for me. My only option is suicide which is inevitable but I'm scared & I want to live."
Therapy was the worst thing that happened to me,"A few years ago when I was suicidal I was lied to by my therapist and told we were going to the hospital for an emergency prescription change. At the time, it made sense. But looking back I feel like such an idiot. 

As I got to the hospital I was honest about how I felt suicidal, but made no plans to commit suicide, and had no method. The doctor told me that soon he’d have a discussion with me about what would be best for me. The second they got me a wheelchair I knew my mistake. I shouldn’t have been honest at all. They all lied to me. There was no discussion, no prescription change. They locked me up in the hospital and for three days I didn’t even know how long I’d be there. 

When I finally got to meet with the doctors there, they wouldn’t listen to me and continuously mocked me and treated me like a child. They were obsessed with stupid parts of my life and wouldn’t listen to my diagnosis I told them I already had (Episodic Depression or Major Depressive? I forget because it’s been a few years and we’ve talked about other things) what I do remember is that at the end of the week they said they diagnosed me with the one I already said I have, like it was new!!!! Like THEY diagnosed me and not my psychiatrist at college!! 

One of the stupid things they were obsessed with was my relationship with my best friend (who is a guy- I’m a woman) and I had to repeatedly clarify he was a friend and they kept trying to get more information about it. It was so fucking weird. Like they asked me who my support system was and I said, “my friends, like this girl, that girl, and Guy” and they’re like WHO IS GUY!!!!!!!!!!! Like it would be such an enlightening thing for me to elaborate on even though I already said he’s a friend of mine. 

I had made some friends while I was in there. Some I still keep in contact with. But worst was just that Im now thousands of dollars in debt from this whole experience. 

I had nightmares for weeks. The anxiety of being locked up completely against your will with no way to contact the outside world but a monitored phone did real damage to me. Having no privacy, no real clothes, being constantly treated like a child- it was all so terrible. 

It sucked. It wasn’t worth it. I’ve learned to NEVER tell a therapist you’re suicidal."
I sleep a lot so I don't have to deal with being awake,"I'm tired. I'm tired of being tired. Today I found out I am royally fucked. My graduate project is faced with ballooning expenses and department politics just cost me 2 department grants I desperately needed. One of them was straight up given to a guy who doesn't even know what his project is, when the fucking grant requires a detailed research plan. I worked weeks on these fucking grants because I knew they were important. I got a paltry sum from some consolation prize. It's nowhere near enough. 

My advisor wrote both my rec letter and the other guys'. I don't think he has any faith in me if this is the outcome. I'm fucked and so is my career. I feel completely betrayed. 

I've had enough of this shit. I'm tired of throwing out all my energy and effort into a system that doesn't care. I want to go to bed, but I have to keep working. 

This program took my love of science through a meat grinder and I have another year to go, unless I withdraw and lose everything."
Anyone else feel like they just aren’t meant for life?,"I’ve been trying so hard for my loved ones sake. But I just can’t. I can’t fit the mold of living in a way that’s respectful to myself and others. I’m so full of self hate and doubt.I hate the person I’ve become. But it’s who I am now, it’s not a sickness anymore, it’s me. I don’t know any other way of life besides what I am now. I just don’t fit the mold of life. I can’t be happy I can’t be sad I’m just here. I’ve always romanticized suicide but the more I think about it the more of a viable and inevitable option it becomes. Is it so wrong of me to want to rid the world of myself, so I can stop fighting, stop feeling hollow. Is it selfish to do that? I don’t see how such a inter personal action could be considered selfish. Idk anymore"
Does anyone else have visual thoughts of their suicide?,"I have suicidal thoughts daily and visualizations of killing myself for the past 6-7 years (I am 21)
They're not really intentional just a reaction to the deep pain and stress I go through every single day of my life. It's a shitty learned hopelessness coping mechanism I've created to cope everytime something bad happens I can just see it"
"In twenty six days, I am throwing a moving away party. I don't have the heart to tell my friends I am thinking about taking my life shortly afterwards rather than go through with my move.","It's strange to me how happy I feel now that I've picked the date. I feel at peace with the idea, but I haven't made any specific plans yet on the method.  


The reasons why I'm suicidal and why I'm moving are really similar. I feel so broken and tired. I've battled mental illness for 12 of the 24 years I've been alive. It's really drained me and robbed me of my full potential. Whenever I seem to find a little bit of calm in between big storms, things come crashing down. 

I'm a high functioning depressed person. I have an active social life. I have a good job. I have some good hobbies. I try to see a therapist and take medication. But deep down, there's a lot of darkness I carry. Nobody knows at work that I constantly question how I should take my life everyday, or if life is worth living. It's the first thought through my head when I wake up. When I've tried to open up to people, they treat me like I'm a burden or a liability. I feel so trapped in a persona that I've built for myself - I put up a facade of a happy and energetic person. I decided to set a date to move to leave everything behind and start a new life. But the big secret I carry is I don't want to start over.

I've really struggled. I've taken countless meds, I've seen a therapist for over three years. I've learned to lie to my boss or people close to me about how I've been feeling. I'm really tired. I tried to kill myself when I was 12 and got hospitalized. I thought that was a low point I would rebuild from. Six years later, when I was 18, my girlfriend hung herself. This year, I got diagnosed with bipolar II. I'm sick of countless crazy side effects from these psychiatric drugs. I don't want to keep having to try to fight this for the rest of my life.

So in 26 days, my friends will all get together for one last party. They'll say their goodbyes, and they'll make peace with not seeing me again for a long time. I think this is the time I'm going to do this. I could move 800 miles away, but that only brings me opportunity to just get hurt again. I don't want to live anymore. I love the people in my life so much, but I can't carry this anymore. I want to die so badly.  


I know this will break some people close to me. That tears me up so bad. But in the end, this is something I need to do for myself."
I cried tonight realizing that suicide was not an option anymore,"For most of my life, I have found tremendous comfort in knowing that suicide was a dependable way out when everything was just too much.  Like a safety net... but the opposite.  In my mind I would play out different scenarios -- some quick and practical, others more extravagant and poetic.  I would always get that same feeling of freedom that people do when they imagine winning the lotto.  It was a huge help.

Recently, I have been supporting my wife through a very difficult period of grieving, and tonight I realized that if I was to end my life, it would completely break her.  So now, with great sadness, I have had to say goodbye to my reliable friend and protector.  The future seems so much harder now.  Thanks for listening."
Does anyone else just wish someone would come up behind them and just shoot them in the head?,"I want to die so beyond badly, but I dont have the courage to do it myself. I'm afraid of failing, becoming brain dead, becoming paralyzed, getting committed and losing my job, my boyfriend... I just wish someone would do it quick for me this way I wouldn't be scared or nervous about it. Itd just finally be over. I'm such a coward..."
ever feel like you weren't meant to be in this world?,"I feel like I belong nowhere. A lot of the time, when I try doing something I always wanted to do, I ask myself after ""is that really it?"". I feel like I should be in another world or something"
How do people work everyday in jobs they hate without wanting to kill themselves?,"I mean seriously. I just graduated college, got a job and now I'm realizing I may have to keep this shit up for 20-30 years. At this rate I might not even survive my first year. How do people do this? Why would you want to work the rest of your life, doing something you don't like for what in the end?"
It’s my 25th birthday,"& ive never wanted to die more in my life

Edit: I had never been on this sub before. I typed suicide into the search bar after an intense breakdown. I wrote out my post and hit send. Force closed the app. I went for a walk with my son who’s under one. I forgot I had even posted this till right now while I’m sitting on the toilet a day later. I’m currently bawling my eyes out in relief. I am curious about the future. Today feels lighter than the societal pressures of yesterday. I am for lack of a better word overwhelmed by what an amazing community this sub is and I’m thankful for all of your support. Please keep pushing one day at a time if you felt anything like I did yesterday. For those of you asking, yes I have been through a tremendous amount of difficult lessons as I’m sure many of you have. I’m currently watching my mother battle her bipolar disorder while trying to raise a child hoping this won’t be his future watching me. But being rational enough to know mental illness is a constant battle. 

Thank you all again. I love myself. But I am exhausted. I feel as if I’m army crawling through life with bloody fingers.

But I’ll keep on keepin on."
anxiety mistaken for rudeness and disregard for respect. depression mistaken for laziness and not willing to put effort forward.,"I'm 17. I'm gonna kill myself this year sometime this year. sometime soon. I didn't have a childhood yet I'm being thrown into adulthood as if I can handle it. I was never stable never since a child never since age 6 or 7. never fucking stable. I'm sorry I'm this way I didn't want to be. but fuck you for making this all about you. fuck you for putting it all on me as if I'm not affected by suicide attempt. by my mother practically abandoning me. by being left alone for years as a kid. as being bullied by my own family. by years of isolation of just wanting to straight up murder myself because that's so stupid. fuck everyone. fuck you. fuck family. fuck ""friends"". fuck my boyfriend. go die and fuck yourself

edit: I thought this would go washed under new. maybe a few upvotes and a comment. but not this. thank you for making me feel heard for once."
Fuck this pointless world,"Who the fuck decided we needed 12+ years of school then you need to work a miserable job until you die.  Same fucking routine every day, vacations once a year if you're lucky. How can people not be depressed? You're fucking brainwashed if you think that this is how life is supposed to be. "
"Does anyone get horrible, horrible heartache that literally is so physically painful?","When I'm sad, like really, really, sad, I get these sharp pains in my heart that are continuous and jerk tears. It hurts so much at times that it spreads throughout my body and I flinch and curl up in pain while my tears uncontrollably drop down my cheeks. My stomach hurts, and my whole body begins to ache, my head starts to pound and that's when I find comfort in the idea of ending it all - that there's a way out. Thinking about it gives me comfort. Writing letters to everyone gives me comfort. Until it feels real and it all comes back and I miss people that I love. I miss the way things were and I miss when i didn't fuck everything up. I miss when I was loved unconditionally."
My friends having a good time is driving me to suicide,"I know how stupid it sounds, but their lives are getting better and better and mine is slipping from my hands. I was feeling fine until a couple of days ago, then i saw them after a long time and they're just having fun, being social, meeting new people and being awesome all around. Meanwhile i get panic attacks in public at the thought of having to speak to someone.  
After seeing them socialize i just lost all hope, all my efforts don't matter if i'm too awkward to do anything with the results,the thought of having to see functional people like them again is making me crave death more and more .  
And nobody is gonna read this cause it's a a wall of text from a socially inept wreck, if you're on this subreddit i suppose it's cause you're going trough something aswell, i hope everything gets better for you"
My sister told me to kill myself (part 2),"Part 1 (Read first): [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cd8n23/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cd8n23/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself/)

Edit- Part 3: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cjl0ro/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself\_part\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cjl0ro/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself_part_3/)

My sister, later that day, *did* apologize (because mom told her to) but it seemed as if she wasn't even sorry. Her ""apology"" wasn't even sincere. She was laughing, looking away, rolling her eyes, as if the whole thing was a fucking joke.

My mom told the both of us that the situation between us has gotten way out of hand, and wants to do family counseling. My sister started arguing with mom, saying how she doesn't want to make up with me.

So I asked my sister, ""Why are you mad at me?""

Of course, she didn't answer and ignored my question. I asked over and over again, but she didn't answer it.

The next day, I told my therapist that I tried to kill myself and she told me that I had to tell my mom. I told her, and she burst into tears. I also told her about all the hurtful things my sister said to me over the years.

Mom: Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Me: I thought you wouldn't believe me, because you and dad always knew her as a nice person.

Eventually, we had to tell dad about what happened. And for the first time, he cried. I've never seen him cry before. And it broke my heart to see my parents like this.

My mom scheduled a session with my therapist on 7/29/19 *with* my sister. But I'm worried that my sister will start lying to my therapist and will try to manipulate her to make it seem like everything was my fault. But my therapist says that she is trained to not fall for that, since she knows my side of the story.

I was told that her boss was going to be there, too, because she's only involved in a session if it involves *serious* cases, such as suicide.

Edit: Thanks for the silver!"
"I just want to sleep and never wake up again, anyone else feel the same?","I'm  24 years old. On the outside I lead a perfectly normal life. I have a  decent salary, friends I speak to regularly, I get along with everybody  at work. I do have goals, ambitions and hobbies.

If  you ever met me, you would not have the slightest clue that I've been  diagnosed as Clinically Depressed. I've had multiple suicide attempts,  one which was truly close where if I didn't have the appropriate medical  attention in a given time-frame I would not be here. I've been with  Psychiatric Teams, and a few Therapists. It's all a temporary measure in  the end.

I am a 'High Performer' in my  workplace, and I have many who rely on me for support. I always smile,  and I try my best to make others happy whenever I can. But at the end of  every day, I feel empty. Most times I have suicidal thoughts. There are  people I am able to speak to and 'open up' about how I feel, however  you can only share how you truly feel one so many times before it  becomes a burden upon them.

In more  recent times, my negative thoughts are becoming more prominent. I have a  strong feeling I may be edging towards attempting suicide once again.  I've taken a few days off work hoping it may help, however I believe  with the absence of working it allows my head to fester these urges and  suicidal thoughts more rapidly.

There is a  brief moment of what I can only describe as insanity that grips me, and  it is at that moment where my life hangs in the balance. Whether it's  my belt around my neck, a blade against my wrist, or pills in my palm. I  have managed to so far overcome each mental battle in those moments in  these past few weeks, however it is likely I may soon lose.

I  am not here for advice or sympathy, the purpose for this post is to  just say Depression does not discriminate. You do not have to have been  through a traumatic event, or to have certain physical attributes you  hate, feeling alone etc. to be depressed. Sometimes you just are, and it  could be for no particular reason at all. We are all human in the end,  and we're all on the same spectrum. Best wishes to you all."
“Have you made any plans to kill yourself?”,"Difficult question to answer doc.

I’ve planned how I’d do it in detail thousand of times, but have I planned it in the sense of how I’d plan to go to the mall and buy a new coat on Tuesday evening? No.

No timeframe, just a very detailed get-out clause for if I stop being able to handle this bullshit life any more. So I don’t know if that counts as making plans or not."
My purpose in life is to be used as a stepping stone and then shit on by the same stupid person,I always end up everyone’s emotional punching bag because I can’t stand the thought of anyone feeling alone. I myself always feel completely and entirely alone.
I want to commit suicide on Xmas Eve just like my sibling,"My brother killed himself on Xmas Eve  when I was extremely young. I still have very vivid memories of it, and the way my family handled it leads me to believe that it didn't really bother them. No one talks about it or mentions him. They have practically erased him from our family's history. Maybe it's because they were ashamed he was gay. Or maybe they were ashamed that he died of suicide. 

Maybe both.

Either way, I want to join him.. Now that I've grown up, I understand why he did what he did. I understand that he wasn't wrong, and I don't feel like I'd be in the wrong for doing the same... I'd be doing the world a favor.

I feel like my life has done nothing but spin out of control since I was a child. It's been nothing but chaos. I was preconditioned not to ever trust. I was sexually abused and pimped out to my stepdad's friends. My mother stayed with a known pedophile while I was relegated to foster care and group homes. 

I feel like I wasn't ever even just given a fair chance. Yet, I went on to get married once a upon a time. I had two kids. I got a divorce. I started a business. I got my bachelor's degree. I bought a house. 

...And then I became addicted to alcohol. 

I made so many stupid choices leading up to now, and because of that, I now have nothing. My children moved to another state with their father after the courts decided he and his wife were better suited to be their parents. And the courts were correct. I'm a fuck up. There's no telling where we'd end up if they were here, but it would probably be within the confines of a cardboard box. I've been sober for almost this entire past yea, minus maybe four or five total slip-ups.. I thought that might fix a lot of my issues, but it hasn't fixed a thing. 

I destroyed my last relationship. I hurt my partner in countless ways. After we broke up for a month, he begged me to come back, and I swore I'd do better or try to be better. I tried as hard as I could.. but I've had to accept that being a shitty person is just who I am. I can't change that about myself, it's embedded in my personality. I broke him into tiny shards of glass, and all he could do when I tried to pick up the pieces was hurt me back. I turned a good person into a horrible, conniving man...

I can't get the job I want. All of my stuff is in storage and I can't pay the bill before the storage place puts a lien on it and keeps it all forever - even the sentimental items like the gifts my children have made for me. Their ultrasounds. Their footprints from their first day alive... My car is gone now, too.. I can't drive to get to work. I can't drive to an interview. I can't drive to a doctor or a mental hospital. I live in the middle of nowhere, and I have no resources. I can't take on new clients and make money. I've fallen as far down the hole as I can, and there's no way back up.

I've had my friends tell me that I should be proud.. that I should just stick things out, because things will get better. But things will never improve, and I haven't felt like I could tell them to what extent my life has become unmanageable.. 

There is literally no way to return to the life that I worked so hard to build, or to better myself and actually do something meaningful with my art or myself as a human being. I don't have the money, I don't have the resources, and I am too afraid to ask my friends or ""family"" for help. 

I feel like they'd be far less inconvenienced if I just didn't exist. I feel like my kids would only have to face one big disappointment instead of a bunch of big disappointments throughout their entire life. I feel like all of the work I put into becoming a valuable human life was all for nothing. I feel like I am a waste of oxygen and space. I feel like all I do is destroy people, and hurt their feelings. 

I have no one. My mother and I are estranged. My remaining siblings and I hardly ever talk. I'm incapable of nurturing a relationship. I'm incapable of being a mother just like my mother was.

I have nothing left, and I have no more motivation to continue on.

I just want to disappear. I want it to appear that I just left without saying a word. No one would notice, because I have done nothing but isolate myself from everyone. I am so ashamed of my life and what it has devolved into, and I don't want to face anyone or burden them with my problems. I don't want to keep trying to fix something that isn't fixable. 

I'm a fucked up person in a fucked up world. People keep trying to tell me that I have so much to live for - that I have so much talent and potential. People keep telling me to keep trying, but they aren't the ones who have to try so it's easy for them. They don't have to live with me, I do. I hate who I am and who I've become. 

I know that I'm sorry. I cannot even begin to describe the remorse that I feel for all of my selfish behaviors, and my depressed demeanor that just brings everyone down. I wish I had treated everyone better: my kids, my kids' dad and his wife, my friends and my remaining family...

I'm everything that I never wanted to be - practically homeless, with absolutely nothing. I have no personality. I have nothing positive to add to the world. I've become so jaded to the thought of dying - like it's going to happen someday, so why do I (and others) keep trying to delay the inevitable? 

I'm sorry if this seemed rambley. I had considered writing letters to a couple of people, but I figure putting it here - anonymously - would be better. I don't want my kids to know I killed myself... so I'm going to disappear to a place where I will never be found. I don't want to tell anyone about it in case they try to change my mind. I'm afraid they'll think I'm just begging for attention. Or maybe they will think I don't mean what I say... but I really do want to die.

Thanks, Reddit."
"funny when they say ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""","when all your existing is the problem in the first place 
when  life is just one big pain in the ass

to me personally i feel like everything is just a big waste of time ...this life is just not good enough not fullfilling enough
its so cold and boring and so so tiring
it's really dreadful 


some people do have temporary problems ...but the others have problems that wont be fixed 
like loss of a loved one or someone you love cheat on you or leave you alone

(( some people can't really get over these tramatic events happend to them not everyone can ""heal"" magically))
and like depression too...(some people tried EVERTHING to overcome depression but they failed)

so please stop saying that Really stupid thing to others who is at the edge of their lives
it will only make them feel more gulit and shame then they already do

(no hate in the comments thats only my opinion) 

EDIT : HOLY SHIT OMG thanks for all of you commenting on this post...it got attention really fast lol i gusse im not the only one feeling this way huh..."
Born to die?,"Has anyone else had the thought if suicide for as long as they can remember? Like it comes and goes, but ya get the feeling that it is your ""destiny"" kind of?

As if it's inevitable at some point that it's gonna happen regardless of what you do or dont do?


Or is it just me?"
I always wonder how it feels to live a happy life,"I’ve been depressed for so long i can’t even remember how it feels to be consistently happy and okay with life. I want to know the feeling of enjoying my life and it’s crazy to think that most people around me have a mostly happy life and here i am thinking about suicide every few hours of the day. It’s also crazy how you don’t even know if someone might be feeling the same as you. I hope everyone reading this has a great day

Edit: I didn’t really think this many people would see this and comment, but it’s nice to know i’m not alone. I hope everyone finds what they are looking for and gets through the struggles in your lives."
Finally stopped— pet cat was the solution,I got a cat. I’m focusing on my company now and stopped trying to trade. The cat brings me so much peace of mind I’m so in love with it. However my dad hates pets and he’s trying to make me get rid of him. I’m so sad I can’t imagine losing him he sleeps on my lap while I work or lays on my desk. I love it so much
"It's my 26th birthday today. I have severe BPD, I am alone, and my mom used my birthday card as a way to argue how BPD isn't caused by abuse and that she is a perfect angel who has never done anything wrong.","I got in a car crash a few weeks ago, I live in a small town, so I lost both my Job's, and I am unable to work now. Every day I take less and less care of myself, no one really calls me, or even cares, and I don't blame them I am pretty fucked up because of The Borderline personality disorder. I hate how alone I am all the time, I hate how little support I have. My life for being a American has been pretty fucking shitty. 26 years of some pretty sever social isolation has taken its toll on me, I have been in and out of hospitals the past year. What is the point of life when you have no love, or support? I can't can't change my circumstances, but I'm just done. I don't see a point to even trying anymore. I have just been laying in bed the past week binge watching porn since I cant afford anything to get high off of. Social media makes things worse, it's all just a bunch of assholes flaunting how they have friends and get to do shit. I even had a severely developmentally disabled girl tell me how she is going to get a date tonight, I know that sounds shitty, I don't hold anything against her that's actually awesome that she can do that. I'm looking at things from my shitty perspective, and I honestly don't want to be alive. People just tell me things will get better, blah blah blah. I am on the verge of being homeless, and I have to live everyday knowing that because both my parents are POS's that my life is fucked, my mental state is fucked, and I am going to suffer till the fay I die. I wish I didn't live in a small hell hole, full of ignored conservatives. Seriously the ignorance in my town is astonishing."
Is anyone else happy in their dreams?,"So often in my dreams I'm carefree and active. Even having fun. 

Then I wake up, and come brutally crashing down into the bleak, unending hell that is real life. It's cruel."
My 15 year old brother hung himself and all I want to do is die too...,"I just feel so hopeless. So fucking hopeless. Everyday I wake up and think about him and how the possibility of me moving out at 18 caused him to despise me and hate me. I had become increasingly distant weeks before he passed because I was so busy with work, getting a new apartment, etc..and I hate being so mad at myself for not being able to be there. I wish I would have been the one to die instead. I am a bitter and angry person all the time and no matter what I do I just can’t seem to get rid of all this anger and aggression I feel. My boyfriend doesn’t help. Just gets mad at me for being mad. I just want to give up. I haven’t cut for over a year but lately it’s been the only thing to help anything. I just want my brother back. I’ve never thought suicide was so selfish until I lost my best friend and all I want is to see him again. It hurts, a piece of my heart is gone. I just wish I could have been the one to die instead.  I just wish I would have died instead."
sorry I ever existed,"I'm 23 and I'm a failure. I fuck up everything I touch. People makes fun of me. Everyone just hates me. The only reason people put up with me is because I was born as a ""human"". 

I want to end this. I just want it to fucking stop. 
Ohh Goddddd. Please help me. Please help me end this.
Let me die. Please I'm tired. I'm just can't anymore. Please please please someone please please why why why why why why why why I'm sorry please forgive me I just can't please end me end me please ohh god please someone anyone please kill me oh god"
I want to die but don't want to kill myself,"Therapist says I'm being too extreme but honestly, I'm just too average at everything to be happy with myself. I'm too dumb to get any of the jobs I want to actually have and I'm too smart to be able to settle for something menial and be fufilled. I'm not depressed enough to need serious intervention but I'm not stable enough to be truly without it. I'm average at everything or worse. I can never achieve what I want to because i am simply not intelligent enough. I don't even have the will power to end everything. I'm just pathetic and weak."
The Foo Fighters saved my life,"This Sunday night, I was about to end my life. I took a few Painkillers, Sleeping Pills and drank some beers. I was just about to slit my wrist, when the radio played my absolute favorite song, My Hero. 
This song finally gave ma a little bit of a good feeling, a big improvement after days of pure numbness, just enough to get me to call an ambulance.

I’m now in a hospital and the suicide thoughts are finally slowly fading away. I hope, it stays this way. 

Thank you so much for reading this and please stay strong!"
I would rather kill myself than grow as a person,"I'm fucking done with life man. Life fucking sucks in every which way. I do not want to be honest about who I am. I do not want yo grow. I do not want to accept anything. I do not want responsible. I don't want to work hard or be a part of anyone's life. I don't want to make a difference or contribute to society. Having a career of any kind is too much fucking work. The truth is I'm perfectly happy to be a leech until nobody is willing to help me out. The. I'll logically be on the streets and at that point I will kill myself. But why let it go that far? Why shouldn't I buy a gun ASAP and be done with it before life even has the opportunity to force me to try being responsible and engaging in the world around me, when I want nothing to do with that? I'm a loser and I'm okay with that. Not being a loser is seriously too much work. Giving enough shit to learn useful things is too much work. I just want to kill myself before anyone that knows me figures out that I don't give a shit about my life or other people and I'm not interested in the least in being responsible in any sense of the word."
I really just wish someone gave a fuck about me,"This is my throwaway account that’s why it has jake Paul as the name it’s a joke 


I remember when I was a kid and I thought I’d have a wife or girlfriend when I grew up, what a fucking joke. Instead here I am stuck in my fucking room because of the fucking dumbass quarantine and no school just wanting to kill myself because no one gives a shit about me

I’ve started texting this girl that I asked out and she of course rejected me because I’m a lowlife piece of shit. She always hits me up first and she’s the only reason basically I have any hope at all except deep down I know she doesn’t give a fuck about me and will never love a useless loser like me

Because of the fucking pandemic I don’t even have soccer, the only thing that kept me going every week, the only time when I feel myself and can express myself and don’t want to fucking kill myself. My best friend has just ghosted me the last few weeks and I’m completely alone, the only person that even texts me is this girl but she won’t hang with me and even if she wanted to she couldn’t because of the quarantine. 

I’m not gonna make it through 3 more weeks of this I just wish I had a gf who cares about me and would hold me close and tell me it’s gonna be ok and I wish I could say this stuff to my friends but I’m a man and I can’t show emotion or I look like a pussy, I just want to cuddle with a girl and be warm and happy I’m such a loser idk I just want to be happy again it’s been so long




BIG UPDATE: ASKED HER OUT SHE SAID SHE LIKED ME TOO BUT WE UNDER QUARANTINE LMAO"
This world is messed up.,"I love this subreddit but it’s really concerning to see so much pain and hurt in one place. To know how many people are suffering quietly without others knowing sucks, especially on just one part of the internet. To all the guys and girls out there I hope you find happiness."
"The ""reasons to live"" askreddif thread only made me feel worse","There are people out there who can be content with the smell of freshly fallen rain and warm garlic bread meanwhile I could have everything and still be miserable.

That entire thread was just a reminder that I'm too broken to relate to other people and I'll never be happy."
I feel so low it physically hurts,"My heart hurts from the pain, I wish I could just disappear, my parents have gone through so much because of me, they do so much to make me happy ,Even my siblings are jealous, I feel so guilty they have to deal with me, see their child try to kill themselves everyday, crying from depression. I just want them to know I love them so much, I can’t even describe how much I love them, and I’m so sorry for what I’m doing, what I am feeling, what I am going to do in the future, I would love to change  but I can’t.

I just wish there is something I can do to feel happy again."
Does anyone here talk to literally no one. Like no friends. I’m rotting,"Anyone else rotting away and dying in this shithole prison cell known as life. I’m not exaggerating either when I say I talk to no one.  I can’t think, I can’t talk I’m a degenerate peace  of shit."
"I told my mom I'm suicidal, she forgot.","A few weeks ago I was doing a few chores with her when I broke down and told her that I hated life and that all I ever did when I woke is wishing something would kill that day because I'm not brave enough to do it myself, she called me ungrateful and I snapped and slapped her (It was wrong and I did apologize after it) she cried and that's where it ended. Today I broke down again and told her I needed help, she told me that I can talk to her whenever I want to Wich I answered ""Don't you remember what happened the last time we talked?"" She said that she did remember, that she remember how I slapped her, when I asked her if she remembers why I did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked ""What were we talking about""

I'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does? I'm just a waste anyways."
I want to die but afraid of dying!!!,"Death. Death. Death. That is all I can think of right now. However, I am scared of dying. The thought of the hereafter scares me to death. What will happen to me after committing suicide? I keep asking myself this question whenever I think of suicide. I also ask myself these questions: how will my loved ones react to my death? What if in the final moments I regret my choice? Will it be painful? And finally: what awaits me after death?

As a religious person, it is not fun at all. Suffering in this world and the hereafter does not sound fair. I just want to end it all without burning in fire for eternity. But I am sure the fire will be my punishment if I were to commit suicide. But at the same time, I am suffering in this world. So really it all comes down to what is worse. I choose suffering here.

But at the same time not. I want to end it all. The shame, the struggle, the pain. Everything in this world I hate. There is nothing stopping me from ending my life other than the hellfire. Not even my loved ones. And I do not even feel selfish writing this. I am being honest.

Someday I am sure suicide will be my only option. Then the fear of hellfire will be gone. Even if it is not gone, I will be so lost and sad, losing my faith, and then I will commit suicide. I cannot wait for that day to come. I will then slice my throat open and, finally, put an end to all my suffering. Or, on the other hand, start a journey full of great suffering. As you can tell, I am contradicting myself all the time. That is because I am lost. And very sad. I want to die."
Can someone just hug me while I cry?,"It's all too much, I lost all my motivation."
I have no friends. Nobody ever contacts me first,"And I'm okay with it. I'm a failed professional who is miles behind academically and professionally my friends. So I don't care about seeing them. They never contact me first and I haven't bothered my ass to contact them in months. I'm at a point now where I say fuck it do I live a life without friends or just end it all now and find peace

Forgot to mention I have zero self esteem"
"Okay so, I'm 21. I have type 1 diabetes, cervical cancer, and a brain tumor. I'm putting serious financial strain on my family with all these medical bills. I just don't see the point in putting them through this, and myself through all the awful treatment, just to like.... die anyway?",It's hard to stay positive and find the will to live. Any advice?
Does anyone else feel like they don't want to kill themselves but they wish to die everyday?,"It's hard to kill yourself here, and the person I trusted the most to talk to betrayed me. I just wish everyday maybe a car will hit me, or some mugger will shoot me in the head. "
never gonna live to be a teenager,"it's fifty past midnight where I am, and I plan on leaving in ten minutes or so.

made a throwaway account so the people who know me on other subreddits don't see this on my account. I don't want to upset anybody. I know there are probably people preparing to comment ""why do you have reddit, you are baby, this is why you are Big Sad toxic community is poisoning our children omg BIG PHARMA"" but please, dear strangers, do not worry. I won't be going against reddit's terms of service for long, now. :')

I know this post is probably gonna be forgotten in about an hour or so, but I want to make record of something while I have time, even if nobody reads it:

My name is Hannah, I'm twelve years old

I love music and painting things and I was here once, too.

things with my family are messy. they want to love me, I think, but things can get in the way. I wasn't what they were expecting, even less so what they were hoping for. I know they'll be okay if they believe that they tried to fix me, and I hope the best for them.

 I hope everyone on here has a moment of luck for them, too, maybe one that ends up saving them from their own hands. Please just try, as hard as you can, because when you're too far gone you'll wish you had.

You are all worthy of happiness. I'm sorry life has treated you like it has, or if you're just somebody who tunes in on here to try and help, you are wonderful and appreciated. 

Try to look for the good while you can still see. I love you, hope I don't see you too soon."
Young doctor (29yo) with suicide thoughts,"First, thank you for opening the post. I'm sharing a bit of my story to try to prevent bad things to happen to me. Please share your thoughts or advise in life. Summary is that I spent all my life savings trying to get trained in the greedy USA healthcare system, but to this day after 15 years of formal education and experience, I continue to be unemployed and financially useless, now struggling with COVID19 lockdown, depression and suicide ideas. 

Young male physician here, 29 yrs, from Latin America (yes, we also use reddit) I've been having suicide thoughts, but not currently depressed. I feel like a fucking failure in life.

Since school I aced exams, test, scores, got honors on my graduation, was extremely dedicated, learned guitar, learned english, I was always either the best or among the best and had high aspirations. Went to the University at age 16 and I stupidly decided to study medicine and become a miserable doctor, let me explain. Medicine is a TOUGH CAREER, very difficult. It is academically, mentally and economically demanding. The amount of stuff you need to study each year is massive, and drains you mentally, socially isolates you from family, friends, parties, relationships, etc.  A dark truth of a recent grad is that you are bullied by superiors or more experienced doctors, pretty much everywhere, medical residency is like that and I seriously suffered that BS during my 1-year medical internship, at that time they evaluated me, so I had no word to defend myself. But I graduated after 8 years of traning (in my country).

Escaping common crime violence in my country, I went to USA to become a doctor there, by passing the USMLE exams (the most difficult exams ever in my life) I spent 2 more years studying for those expensive exams, and another year getting doing unpaid clerkships to get experience and recommendations and connections. Life in the US as immigrant if TOUGH man! Nobody wants to employ you due to visa. You cannot earn any money. I did cleaning, mopping floors, dog walking and other odd jobs to support me (WHICH IS ILLEGAL AS FOREIGNER). When I had all the requirements, guess what? You have to pay fees of applications to participate in the selection process of residency in the USA each year, so I spent $5000 only in applications and flying tickets. I received few interviews in hopes to get a job, but did not get anything, and lost $5000. I tried again next year and the results were the same with same dollars lost. I felt fucking scammed, and to this day i'm still angry at my experience in the USA.  I spent like $70,000 of my third-world-hard-earned dollars in the whole process, paying rents, bills and educational courses to prepare and in the end the result was nothing. NOBODY WILL EMPLOY YOU IN HEALTHCARE IF YOU DON'T DO A RESIDENCY FIRST, which I failed to secure twice. And NOBODY will employ you at any job in the US if you are not citizen. 5 stupid years wasted + 8 years of home training.

I came back defeated to my country in hopes to get any job. I faced another reality and that is there are no jobs for doctors here, there are just too many doctors today. I lowered my life expectation even more and looked for any other job available, but then COVID-19 happened. My country is in lockdown, I'm quarantined, unemployed, with no money, no financial power, living with now elderly parents at my old home with rampant crime (paralized temporarily due pandemic), living off the charity of others, unable to move, unable to sleep due suicide thoughts, and writing this. Most of my classmates became specialists or got married or got jobs or moved to other countries. I feel like i'm in the starting line. I'm now almost 30 years old, indebted, single and poor. I'm ashamed of what I experienced, I'm ashamed to say I'm unemployed and have never had a real formal stable job, and still hunting for one. I'm a miserable unemployed doctor.

 You want to make it worse? Law in my country requires me to serve in the COVID emergency pandemic when system starts to collapse, totally UNPAID or I could be charged a fine or brief jail time.   

Failure is the word to describe what I am. I hate myself, I constantly punish myself for making bad decisions and I blame my extreme bad luck and also blame the silence of God despite me being religious. Education was in vain in my life. The only thing that prevents me from commiting suicide is my parents, but after I bury them, I think I might take the shot. 

I'm sorry you had to read the long post, sometimes I feel I did nothing wrong: I studied, I graduated, I behaved, I followed the rules (and also the USA rules) did not became an asshole, murderer or alcoholic or anything, but still life kicks me in the balls. Then why can't I be offered a fucking job? I no longer care about medicine, I no longer care about myself, but I might care in what you have to say, please react to my life story. I will read you thoroughtly"
I'm 12,My parents make me want to kill myself the only thing stopping me is my dog I need help
I don't want people to remember me.,"I only want my close friends and family members to remember me... Not people I haven't talked to in a year or so... It's offensive to me. You could have talked to me and you could have cared, but untill I take my own life, you suddenly care and miss me... I don't mean to offend anyone on this post..."
I fucking hate my brain,It's such a goddamn stupid piece of shit and I wish I could blow it out.
Can't even have the smallest fucking things.,I'm just so angry with life and fucking done. Nothing will ever change for the better it's all a fucking joke.
Suicide is on my mind 24/7 but I know all that I really want is to feel like I’m loved.,"Hi everyone, my name is Everett. I’m turning 15 soon and I’ve grown up in an abusive religious family. I switched schools last year because I had to take care of my grandparents because they can’t support themselves anymore. My last school I got bullied a lot and people didn’t take me seriously when I talked. I don’t get bullied at my new school but it’s because of other reasons. People started making rumors of me at my new school that I was gonna kill everyone and “shoot up” the school.i don’t know who my real friends are and which ones just don’t want to be the “target” for “when I shoot up the school” because I have Asperger syndrome. I’ve been rejected my whole life to the point where I have no self confidence. My longest relationship ever was 1 month. I want something that’s longer but I feel like no one trusts me. My mother hates me because I constantly fuck up, and I turned out to be a male at birth instead of female. She wanted a girl. My real dad is a drunk bastard and I disconnected ties with him 2 years ago. My step dad is a religiously abusive person who thinks I have to follow his religious rules but he doesn’t. He constantly emotionally abuses me when I do things “not holy”. I’ve wanted to run away since I can remember up till about 6th grade when I realized with my state’s laws that I can’t and it would be easier to end myself. So I’ve attempted suicide 5 times since then and I’m such a failure I can’t even kill myself properly. Again, you might say that “I don’t need a girlfriend at my age” but i feel as if that is the only thing I want anymore. I recently got a job and I bought a few things that I thought might help but of course it didn’t. I just want to feel as if I’m loved and I want to turn my sadness into love for them. But of course I can’t have it. I’m doubting what I believe in right now. The only things that can remotely make me happy is my cats. I also think I’m a psychopath. Ive pointed a loaded .22 at my step dad before and if anything I should’ve pulled the fucking trigger. But of course, I’m such a fucking pussy I couldnt even do that properly . People keep telling me it’ll get better ever since i remember but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Parents legal rights are stupidly high compared to other states so emotional and physical abuse is usually permitted. I constantly build everything up because I don’t want to hurt anyone and I don’t know when it’ll come out. Everyone that I think I might have a chance with pushes me away after I express my feelings to them.it just has gotten to the point I can remember the last time I’ve smiled. I have to wear a mask in front of my parents (emotional mask) because if they found out I wanted to kill myself they would take one of the few things that is keeping me here today because they think video games and texting is all of my problems. I have to wear a mask everywhere I go because someone could report it and my parents would find out. It doesn’t help either that every adult I know doesn’t take me seriously because I’m not an adult. Anyways if you’ve read up to this point, thank you. (No formatting because I’m on my phone rn)"
Today is my Birthday...,"I turned 20 today. It's significant because I never thought I'd make 20. The last few years have been really rough and I can't count how many nights I thought about taking my own life. Yet here I am. I broke down in the shower just thinking about how close I was to not being here. 

&#x200B;

I start counselling soon and I'm going to make a big effort to try and turn my life around. I've spent long enough being miserable and I deserve to be happy. I hope on my next birthday I look back on this day proud of how far I've come. I hope that this is the last Birthday where I feel sad."
You ever wish someone would kill you so you wouldn’t have to do it?,"Purposefully running around late at night through shady places

Not paying attention when nearing roads

Almost “accidentally” getting hit by a car"
It’s 4am. I have my first class of the semester in 5 hours and I can’t sleep,"I wasted my whole fucking summer looking for jobs and getting nothing. I can’t do internships because my grades suck. My whole family thinks I’m a lazy sack of shit for “not doing anything” and instead of relaxing for two months I was just stressing to make sure I could make $100 a month

I’m stressed because literally nobody around me fucking needs me."
I wish I could give my life to someone who wants to live,"Sometimes, I wish I could trade places with a terminal cancer patient who is holding onto life as tightly as he can. I do not have any enthusiasm for life, and it seems like a waste. I feel like I am going through the motions, just waiting to die... and it's going to be a long wait. I have been in therapy for 10 years, and it's constantly like this. I wish euthanasia for mental illness were a thing.

See, there is nothing in this world that brings me joy. I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have a job. I am going to be evicted if I do not find something before May, and while I have been applying, I also don't see the point. I have this black-and-white image in my head-- like a flipbook-- of me going through the motions until I am older enough to retire. I think I would rather cut to the chase because being alive hurts. There mornings where I wake up and take a handful of sleeping pills to make myself fall asleep again. That's really what I am doing... I am waiting to die.

It kind of feels good to type this out. I have not been out of my apartment for almost two weeks. It's almost like I've forgotten what the sound of my own voice sounds like. My boyfriend recently moved away, and we hardly talk anymore. My therapist dumped me (it's a long story + it was kinda my fault, so dont blame her), so I am without support (or structure). I do not have any friends. My family thinks I am being a drama queen and won't ""play"" this game with me anymore. If I were to kill myself tonight, I wonder how long it would take the world to notice. I imagine it would take a while unless my decomposing body starts to smell and a neighbor complains.

I have prescriptions for a whole cocktail of drugs, but I am not 100% certain that an overdose would be successful. I'm 80% sure since I have stimulants and relaxants and sedatives and with some alcohol-- I don't drink, so I image I don't have a lot of tolerance-- it almost feels like I can pull it off. My biggest fear is failing. I am afraid I will only have a seizure and then have to deal with the aftermath of my suicide attempt. God, I don't want to spend more time in a psych ward. 
"
I wish boys were allowed to be feminine without being judged.,"I’m a feminine guy and I just want to express it when I’m at school. The judgement that I get is too much to bear and the only thing that I can get away with is a flower in my hair, and even then I get a few insults hurled at me. I would do much more if I wasn’t judged. I can’t express who I am to the world and have to bottle it up.

I fucking hate this. This is just a minor point in the many reasons I just want to kill myself."
My father is tired of me “hurting” my mother. He is offering to find me an apartment so I can live alone and away from her. I will use this opportunity to kill myself.,"As I mentioned in previous posts, my mother is emotionally and physically abusive to me. She has the gal to blame me for enraging her to do these things. My father is getting tired of her constant tantrums, and is offering to give me an apartment he will pay for so she can be free of me.

I will use this to my advantage to finally end my own life. Once I am alone in my apartment, with no one to stop me or witness me, I will overdose on all my medication pills at the same time. Then, I will die and finally know peace. Maybe then my parents will know peace too."
"I have been struggling the past three months. My mom died and my boyfriend of 7 years left. Nobody understands the pain, and nobody understands the situation. My mom wouldve. My mom wouldve told me all the right things instead of all the shit im hearing right now. I want to go to my mom.","So i have a bottle of pills in my hand, and im waiting for my dad and my brother to fall asleep. So i can sleep. So i can see her again."
I'd kill myself today if it wasn't for my family. I'd ruin their lives,"I hate myself but I know if I commit suicide, I'll destroy my family, I'll ruin their lives and they'll be so sad :("
Is there really a good reason to be alive?,"Seriously, all I see on here is people saying the same things,” It will get better.”,” What about your family or friends?”,” Suicide is a permanent solution is a temporary problem.” saying the same things over and over again that don’t mean anything. Is there a reason suicidal people should stay alive BESIDES living for other people, so other people won’t feel bad about it? 

All I keep seeing are these the same cringy quotes and it’s just making me even more suicidal. I swear if I hear more of that dumb shit I’m going to just end it already."
If I ever get corona I am gonna make sure that I fucking die.,I wish I get corona without hitting anyone and if I fucking do get corona I am gonna make sure that I die. It's not like my existence fucking matters anyway.
Who else is waiting until they feel they're allowed to kill themselves?,Personally my mom couldn't bear with it so I'm waiting until she passes away. Once this happens I can finally end this misery.
Passive Suicidal Thoughts,"Whenever I'm at a crosswalk and a car is stopped for me, I think of getting them to step on it. Whenever I'm at the top of a staircase, I think of letting myself fall down it. Whenever I'm at a ledge, I think of stepping over it and hitting the ground below. Even though these things probably wouldn't kill me and would just leave me with some horrible injuries, I still can't help but think of them every single day. There's always that ever-so-slight push in the back of my mind trying to guide me into giving up and giving in to these thoughts."
This will get lost in a sea of Suicide notes,"I’m using this to say exactly how I feel cause I know no one will see this. 

The last time I was genuinely happy was when I was 5.. then my grandfather died. I was extremely close to him and after his death things just weren’t the same, fast forward to 7th grade my father whom I was never close to despite living in the same house decided to slowly leave his family for another family and left my mom and I alone, then my mother took him back which kissed me off and caused me to an angry child who didn’t trust anyone... which probably caused me to never have a real relationship cause I never feel good enough and I can never fully trust them. Anyways I was always socially awkward/ shy and didn’t have a lot of friends but I have 3 childhood best friends I can at least say I have but as we’ve gotten older and everyone is moving on with their lives I feel stuck. 

My life began to really fall apart in the fall of 2017 ( my second year of college) when I began to rapidly lose the vision in my left eye due to a condition I have that I didn’t even know about until the year before but the doctors said I shouldn’t worry to much about it, due to the loss of my vision in that eye I had 2 eye surgeries to try and repair it but they didn’t work which shocked the doctors. I took a semester off of school to recover and came back in hopes to finish school, then in February of this year the vision in my right eye began to slowly go away. I had to quit my job and leave school and move back in with my parents to try to “ heal”..

I eventually got a job ( which I hate with a passion) and became stuck... then I got into a car accident and totaled my car so now I’m carless. I want to go back to school and get a new car but I feel like what’s the point if I won’t be able to see in a few months, everyday when I wake up before I open my eyes I think “ am I going to be able to even see”. It sucks because surgery won’t work, I’ve tried the holistic approach too and I’m still just slowly losing my sight. I really took things like that for granted.  My parents put me in therapy and it has caused me to face things but with my looking at the bigger picture I’m like what’s really the point? 


I’ll have 3 days of me feeling like myself and”happy” then it’ll be weeks of me in a deep depression wanting to kill my self or hoping I’ll die. I told my mother I want to kill myself before I go completely blind because I couldn’t live like that ( respect to those that are blind and live cause y’all are strong.. even though y’all can’t see this) so I said I’m going to see how the rest of the year plays out cause I’m not going into 2020 like this, but it’s like when I try to get my shit together nothing goes right, I had my heart set out for this new job and everyone there was like you got the job, the supervisors liked you, the employees recommended you, etc... no call back ( I was supposed to get one yesterday if I got the job) that was my breaking point. 

That job really was a push for me to keep going but now that I didn’t get it I feel stuck again, I feel like I sound stupid and dramatic and I know this is worded horribly but I guess I’m just writing my jumbled thoughts out. I’ve been looking up easy ways to kill myself but I’ve seen that there are none... if I had a gun I’d just shoot myself, I looked up ODing on pills but it’s hit or miss and the miss will fuck you up, I thought about hanging myself but I’m black and I’d feel weird idk lol, I think about driving into oncoming traffic and hoping I’ll die but I don’t want to total my dads car cause that’s his property, I thought about cutting myself but I’ve read that that’s a slow death. 

It’s like why is it so hard to die when you want to but when life is going good then you get sick, or die, etc. I guess I sound like a bitch cause I want to die but I don’t want to feel any pain but I guess I’ll have to feel pain in the process cause afterwards they’ll be no more pain. There’s like so much going on in my head and so much to write but idek what to say tbh even though I already said a lot, all in all I’m just so tired. Tired of crying myself to sleep, crying to work, crying at work, crying alone at home, and crying myself to sleep. I’ve been trying to disconnect myself from people but it’s like I still crave human interaction that’s why I feel like a fraud cause I want to be alone but I don’t to feel alone. 

This whole thing probably doesn’t even make any sense but I’m just writing out my thoughts. No one will see this anyways or even read all of this anyways. At first I was giving myself till the end of the year but now I’m just trying to find the best method to end it."
Humanity is the worst race to be a part of,"We are like enslaved cows, we are born forced to go to school to ""get education"" so that we can be ""successful"", then we must word 9 hours a day to be able to live peacefully and those who are out of that format are either lucky or homeless. I am too a part of that format. Recently found someone that cares about me(a girlfriend) but i just can find the place in my heart to like her. She is amazing and beutiful yet i cant stop looking at other girls and wishing they were intrested in me. Im stressed as fuck from school and it all doesnt seem worth. Adult life does not look good. at all.
I dont have the guts to do it to my family thought. I just wish the world would end"
Currently in hospital,"Jumped of my house’s roof and ended up with a broken hip, arm and leg and a broken skull and needed surgery, DONT DO IT IS NOT WORTH IT.
I’m very homesick right and I’m going inpatient to the psych ward soon. Life is shit but we all gotta keep fighting.
Edit: my house is not two story but three."
I'm suffering constantly I just want it to end,Edit: I'd like to thank people for all the support on this post I didn't think it would get that much attention. Lots of you are going through a similar thing and it's nice that people understand and tell me to have hope. I of course still feel terrible but knowing there are people out there who are willing to support those going through this is great. I'd also like to tell anyone with negative comments on here that you really aren't helpful and shouldn't be on this subreddit
I’m losing everything,"Due to severe depression, I lost my job and have absolutely no money. I have bills to pay and no way to pay them. My lease is up in less than two weeks and I have no money for a new place and I haven’t even started packing yet. I’ve filled out countless applications and haven’t heard anything. I’m so scared and I don’t know what to do!!!"
Y'all ever just lay down in bed in the fetal position and cry and just try to will yourself out of existence for a couple hours?,Anyone else do this?
College is stupid and it makes me want to die even more,"I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with my school in particular. They never even showed me how to schedule an advisor meeting. I started out with 4 classes and had to drop two of them because I was failing (both grades below 50%) and these profs couldn’t teach if you put a gun to their heads. 

Now I have this whole English research paper to write on some bullshit topic I chose and we have to “collaborate” and “brainstorm” in class with people who are writing COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PAPERS. It’s fucking stupid. They’re not sharing my grade why should I have to ask for their help?? I keep skipping class cause I don’t want to go through that bullshit even if my grade suffers.

I think I’d be happier dropping out, living with my parents, and just working two jobs so I can focus on my side hustle. It’s just hard when my parents are immigrants and they keep telling me I’m wasting the opportunity they gave me. 

I don’t know. I just know I can’t take this shit anymore."
"I don’t want to die, but I no longer want to exist.","There is no point to this. Society has made it almost impossible to not live in a damn cycle of work come home, get 2 hours to yourself, go to sleep. And then you get to do it again. 
If that’s all there is, why even continue on.
I’m never getting married or having kids, for personal reasons..So I don’t have a responsibility to continue on either, but I know I could never kill myself, which makes it even harder. I know there will be no relief for the pain I feel every god damn day. I’m jealous of everyone who is content living like a damn robot slaved to society doing the exact same thing everyday. I wish I could be happy doing that, but I just feel like I’m wasting my damn life away."
I just told my parents im suicidal,Now I'm going to get some professional help. wish me luck please
I am ending my life tonight,"Tonight, I’m finally ending it all after 21 years of living.  I was neglected by my mother when I was an infant, her neglect and inattentiveness led to me being sexually abused by my caretaker. This has led to many psychological problems such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD and borderline personality disorder. I have wanted to die since I was 6 years old. I see no hope in living anymore. 

I ruin all my relationships. The love of my life broke up with me a month ago. In a state of despair, I hooked up with random men to fill the void. My ex said he would never get back together with me if I slept with other people. I see no point in living. I’m an abusive pile of shit who isn’t capable of being loved because I hurt the people I love most. I have been in therapy for years and I continue to be a fucking monster. 

I ordered refills for medication I have been hoarding. Tonight, I’m going to drive to a place that was special to my ex and I. I am going to end it all tonight. There’s no point in living if my brain will never be fixed. There’s no point in being alive if I’m a terrible human being who never even had a chance. This is my last goodbye."
Enough,"I am 40 years old. Another failed relationship, no kids. 10 brothers and sisters only one speaks to me. I was convicted of manslaughter at 16 years old and spent 7 years in prison. Prior to that was raised in system in southern California. Dad was murdered when I was 6 and mom is a junky. I know all the things people want to say, sadly, I'm just tired of chasing a dream. I have seriously  given this a really good shot. The only positive thing I did in my life was quit drinking four years ago. Dont know why I'm posting here. Just interested I guess to see what if anything will come of it. Take care"
Humans :),"Humans are funny creatures. When you tell them ""I am happy, I am good at this"" they make fun of you and say ""you're a loser you should go kill yourself"".

When you tell them ""I'm a loser. I'm gonna kill myself"", they go ahead and tell you ""noooo please don't, you deserve life and happiness like everyone"".

&#x200B;

Fuck you humanity. Fuuuuuck, you.

&#x200B;

Edit: Ok my intention wasnt not spreading hate. I'm pointing out the irony of our nature as human beings. When I say humans I'm talking about people who live in modern society, and I'm included in that bunch."
It's 11:40 and I'm gonna kill myself at midnight.,"Not here to be talked out of it, just wanted to say something anonymously I guess. I just got dealt a shitty hand in life in a lot of ways. Sure not as shitty as some others have it, but it's all shitty. I was never meant to find someone to be happy with or anything like that, I was always meant to die alone. I tried to avoid it but by 30 it became clear the path I was going down.

More importantly, I just never was happy with myself or life in general. Losing loved ones, losing touch with friends and never making new ones, being bored with the work I chose but having no interest in going back to school. Life is just not worth it to me. Lots of suffering and sadness with not much upside. I said if I wasn't feeling better by 31 I'd end it, and here I am. I'll miss my family but I'm done ""being strong for others."" Time to take care of myself.

I chose a method that is very lethal and should go quick. Yeah I know ""you might screw up"" but oh well, that's a risk I'll take. Oh and I'm sure someone will show up to tell me I'll go to hell like they always do to people here, and yeah, I'm shaking in my boots ;) lol.

Holy shit, 15 minutes now as I write this. I'm scared obviously but also excited. It'll finally be done.

Good luck everyone no matter your situation, if you choose to keep going I hope you end up better than I did. Bye."
"How do I get out of an abusive household with no money, no friends, no ID, no phone? (22F)","I'm almost 22 and I'm fucking done. I'm done being held hostage by my father, everything about my life controlled like I'm a prisoner. I'm done hearing how gay people deserve to be genocided. I'm done hearing how women deserve to be raped and confined in chains. I'm done being told to do impossible things like rip off the government(?? how) to bring money into a house, money that is supposed to go to a new house but instead gets spent for weed. I'm done hearing him degrade my mother and her just taking it. I'm done with my fucking low-functioning sociopathic half-brother who sets my father off and makes him abuse the rest of us once he loses it, including my poor dog. And of course, my brother gets anything he needs anyways, because he's male and worth more than me.

I've never worked. Never had a boyfriend in real life. Never had a real life friend since I was 11. I graduated high school online a year late with a GPA of 1.7 because he wouldn't let me study. I hurt or ghost everyone I get close to online because he cuts the internet and changes passwords every other day to keep me off so what's the point.

I need to get out. It's either I get out, soon, or I kill myself and hopefully take him with me beforehand, whether it be today or next week or next month. It's been looming for a while now, the urge. The only reason I haven't yet is because I didn't know how until recently, my life is THAT FUCKING CONTROLLED that I couldn't even kill myself. Hell, the fucking kitchen knives are so dull they can't even cut bread, let alone an artery. But I know how now. It came to me tonight, as he rages and calls people like me sick things that deserve to die and throws things and threatens to cut peoples throats. I have the resolve, I have the means. It doesn't even hurt to say it now. In fact, this is the first time I haven't cried all night, because I've accepted it.

I can't drive. No ID or money for a bus. I don't even know where my social security number is. There's no women's shelter, or any shelter, in this piece of shit town he confines us in. Hell, I probably wouldn't make it if there was, I'd be raped or abducted into human trafficking before I got there, that's the kind of place it is. I can't even call the police, no phone and they're known for being wifebeaters and raping girls up on the reservation anyways, they don't care about one girl.

Please, if anyone knows an out. I don't even want to post here, it's probably not the right place, I feel like a lost cause anyways. But I'm trying. I'm trying so fucking hard to hold on. 22 years is a long time to hold on. I'm so tired.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for the replies. I'm going to try to sleep or distract myself on my main reddit since I most likely won't be able to rest. I just wanted to say I'll make it through the night (well, morning now) and get back to any new replies when I can tomorrow"
"Does anyone else feel like they have to commit suicide to get revenge on the people that hurt me, to tell the world I am not gonna put up with its crap, and to that I have to do it to ask the world to solve the problems I am facing for others?","I have been suicidal ever since my grandparents passed away several years ago. I don't have much family, I feel like I need to kill myself to escape that pain because it can't be solved because you can't bring dead people back from the dead, and I feel like if I kill myself I can leave a note to tell the world to solve this problem for others. I am estranged from the family I do have and I feel like I need to kill myself to let them know they have hurt me. I hate how I don't have a big family, lots of friends, don't have a good job or are rich, and don't get to go on vacations. People disrespect me. I feel like if I kill myself I can tell the world that I am not gonna put up with its unfairness. 

Would me commuting suicide and writing a detailed note change the world? 

I hate how people think of mental health issues when they think of suicide when they don't think of lonliness or lack of family casting it. 

I know some peopme say that family doesn't have to be blood but someone will always tell me when I say that ""blood is thicker than water"". Maybe this will tell the people that say that I won't put up with that bullcrap."
No one will ever love me,"No friends, no girlfriend and I doubt I'll get any. I get so little attention in my life that I seek some orange arrows and empty comments from strangers on the internet. I have nothing to live for. I just waste my life more and more everyday. I will never achieve anything, no one will miss me and I have no one to miss. I don't even like my family. 

My savings is my timer. I have been jobless for 6 months now, and once my savings are dried up I'm  going to kill myself. I've already tried killing myself before, but I will make sure to finish the job next time. I would rather be dead and continue living in this worthless life. I look forward to using the rest of my money, I find peace knowing I won't he here for much longer. I'm too tired to continue trying. 

So to the few of you that actually read this, good luck. You'll need it in this fucked up world. I hope you find a reason to live."
My worst fear has come true and I have already decided that I am going to take my own life,"I am a 31 yo gay male who was severely bullied throughout my childhood whilst having to come to terms with my sexuality. Nowadays it’s ok to be gay but when I was growing up it was not. I was surrounded by people both in and out of school that would either physically and mentally torment me and others that would just watch it happen and do nothing to help as if i deserved it. I was very confused and vulnerable at the time so I felt powerless to stop it and just let it happen.

As a result, I developed OCD and body dysmorphia. From that point on I thought the only way people would ever accept me or want to be around me is if I was perfect. I strived for perfection; i was a straight A student, I ate really healthy, I was physically active and I valued my appearance above all else. I could confidently say that I was an attractive guy and I know now I had a lot going for me. Regardless of how hard I tried to be perfect over the years I developed social anxiety and although I had some really good memories, the anxiety plagued most of my young adult life and I missed out on so many good opportunities because of it. Slowly but surely I was able to move past my mental issues and live a somewhat normal life. I had a good job, decent friends and a loving family. 

When I turned 29 I fell in love with this guy who looked like an angel and we were both madly in love. I thought I could finally be happy unconditionally and it would have all been worth it. It wasn’t until we moved in together that I realised he was anything but angelic and that’s when the physical and mental abuse started all over again - Like I was back in high school. He was a sociopath but I didn’t realise until it was too late. He abused me throughout our relationship and slowly tore me down til I was nothing. 

After 2 years of torment I finally got out of the abusive relationship and got a place on my own but that’s when all my unresolved childhood demons came to surface. My body dysmorphia and OCD came back but with extreme vengeance. I dissected everything about my appearance; my hair, my body my skin etc. My hair wasn’t as thick as it was in my early 20s so I went to turkey and got a transplant, whilst I was there I also got Lipo on my stomach even though I know now I didn’t even need it. I came back from Turkey and worked out every day for 12 months until my body was perfect. I was once more trying to become the ultimate version of myself even though there was nothing wrong with me to begin with.

It all took a turn for the worst when I started focusing on my skin. My skin wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t bad. I researched ways to improve it and found something called skin needling that most beauty clinics offered as a way to rejuvenate the skin. I bought a package of 5 sessions at my local clinic and did the full course of 5 spread out a month apart. After the first few sessions I noticed my skin was getting irritated, red and dry. I brought this up with the rep but she assured me this was normal and that it was because my skin was healing. Cut to the last session I got a severe infection and severe inflammation which slowly resulted in my entire face becoming fibrotic and scarred. In the night time you can’t see too much but in the day if you look at my face I look deformed. My entire face has fibrotic scarring that resembles scratch marks as if an angry cat did a number on me. I have seen multiple dermatologists and they can’t help me. This disfigurement is permanent and I look like a monster. 

I have seen multiple psychologists and they are trying to help me try and come to terms with it but I just can’t. One told me that this is my worst fear come true since all the value I put on myself was in my appearance. Every time I look at myself in the mirror I want to die. I feel like if I didn’t have body dysmorphia Which is obviously making the situation so much worse I may have stood a chance. 

I have taken a month off work for the Christmas period and have been staying at my parents because I’m too scared to be alone. For the past month  I have been drinking excessively every day, eating excessively and smoking excessively. Every part of my being has given up on life and I havnt left my room. I have been researching ways to end my life and I feel like this is it for me; after all this struggle with my mental health this is how it’s going to end. My worst fears have come true.

My parents and brother can see what has happened and they sympathise with me but they don’t realise the extent of how much this has really messed me up. I wake up every morning in disbelief this is happening to me. Everyday for the past month I have wished to die and it’s only getting worse every day. My brother told me in confidence he went through his own struggle not too long ago and was planning to hang himself in our storeroom. He showed me the ropes and where he would have tied them. Unbeknown to him this is how I plan to end it.  

I don’t know if anyone will read this or can relate. I hope someone will."
Not even really depressed - Simply realized that the way reality is constructed just doesn’t suit me,"I would probably kill myself if it wasn’t unfair to the people that love me. I don’t have any specific problems, successful with all the things that I do but I just don’t like doing all the things you have to do to live. I don’t like living and it’s pointless. One the one hand I cannot destroy the lives of my parents and affect my friends in such a tragic way on the other hand I hate existing, what should I do?"
"""it will get better"" being the biggest lie ive been told. I desire suicide.","I currently suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, clinical depression and general anxiety, and would rather abuse alcohol than take antidepressants, which I believe wouldn't help my already 'too far gone' mindset. 
I'm crushed under the weight of the simplest of daily tasks, getting out of bed in the late hours of the day and walking around tiredly with no motivation to get things done no matter how long I've slept, struggling to shower and get myself clean, suffering from loss of appetite some days to completely over indulging other days, or even just sitting up in my bed. 
I lay there for hours upon waking up, lightheaded from crying for hours in the early hours of the morning until I feel sick, staring blankly at my TV which is almost never turned off. 
I never leave my room. I store bottles of water and food by my bed so I can interact with my housemates as little as possible and drink heavily most nights and pass out drunk after hours of Xbox and minor interaction with the outside world.
I hardly have the stomach to face my housemates, ignore every phone call, mute every messaging service I use and reply to people weeks later only to find they have lost interest in staying in contact with me and decide to distance themselves before I would be able to push them away with made up situations I create with them in fear of abandonment. I fear rejection. I push people away before they get the chance to do so to me so I can say I wasn't the one who fucked up even though cutting the ones I love out for no proper reason is the very definition of ""fucked up"".
What surprises people the most is the fact that I am well aware that I have friends.
I am well aware that I have people in my life who love me and care about me so much that they want to support me and see me recover and do something productive with my life.
I am well aware that I need help. 
I am not in denial. 
But I'm made to believe I'm a selfish wreck for wanting to die.
I'm made to believe I'm a dumbass for not getting help, all the offers of support and ignoring them so I look fucking stupid despite telling people I just..can't. I don't have the energy anymore. Like, I just can't.
I had goals in life. I dreamt of a sober, healthy lifestyle surrounded by my closest friends and a loving relationship, not being unemployed and relying on benefits because I'm simply too damaged to work a proper job. Just being happy.
Unfortunately, a life like this is almost impossible for the mentally unwell. Knowing you'll have these illnesses for the rest of your life, risking your relationships with your friends and family, your significant other, and the risk of diving so low that you lose your job and end up in the dirt with nothing left or a substance addiction.
I couldn't tell you what's worse.
So far, I found someone I wanted a long lasting relationship with, we love each other and put up with the rough edges we constantly face because of my mental breakdowns and BPD making me believe he was my partner only to make me feel better about myself and that he never truly loved me and that destroyed so much. He faced paragraphs of my insecurities and self loathing, the validation seeking, the questions about whether he even really loved me and it fucked everything up. We had a 6 month break and things returned to the way they were, but once again I destroyed everything because of the shitty made up situations I made up in my head. I'm deeply in love with this person and I struggle to see it work out anymore unless I fix myself but I'm beyond help and don't know how I would even fix myself at this point. 
I have given up. 
I am tired. 
I wanted to fix myself to prove to him that I could be the best person I could possibly be, love him the way he deserves to be loved, and prove to him just how sorry I am for the drama and hurt I caused him. The verbal abuse, the drunken abuse. I look back at the things I did and I just struggle to live a day to day life knowing I caused so much hurt to the person I've loved so deeply since I met him. The person I would give so much for, to bend over backwards just to see him smile. All I think about is the memories we made together and it aches me that I'll probably never experience these things with him again because I'm so broken. Friendship with this person is hard, and I'm deeply saddened that I can't tell him just how I feel. It has driven me to believing I'd be better off dead so I can't hurt him anymore.
I also wanted to fix myself for my family. My friends. 
For myself. Things could be so good right now if I wasn't such a horrible person, so far all I've ever done is created problems for everyone that I've ever loved/everyone that's ever loved me and I can't stand this life anymore. I'm so fucking sad and I'm sick of hurting everyone I love. 
I am unlovable and don't deserve friends. 
This may be it for me, Reddit, this is the tip of the iceberg but the internet cares little for a complete strangers life troubles. 
I have a strong desire for suicide right now, and believe this is the gateway to solving my problems. 
I don't think anything could save me now. 

Mum would be devastated, and who knows if anyone in my circle of friends would care, and I love my mother but I am in pain."
16M can I tell my therapist about my suicidal thoughts without him telling my parents?,"I don’t want to go to a mental hospital

Edit: I talked to my therapist and he told me he is going to tell my parents. I appreciate everyone trying to help me, but I just don’t see things getting better."
Anyone else ever feel like suicide gives them hope?,I feel like it's the only way I'll ever be able to escape the hell im slowly creating for myself.
Being alive is fucking painful. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.,Post history for context
"Sleeping and dreaming is the only enjoyment I get daily, anymore","Each day I wake up as I near closer to 24, I feel as though little has been felt to be accomplished by myself in my wandering through every new week. 

It’s all too much anymore to accept that my life has led me to where I am now— to simply accept that all of my successes and failures have ultimately left me lost in myself. I have no direction. I have no college education, my job prospects are slim with each one feeling terribly meaningless, giving no joy or sense of accomplishment for having attempted or even succeeded, at times to perform adequately.

I have a relationship, I suppose I am better for it, but each day I wake up, I feel as though every moment I try to engage with my partner, I bring him down in my depression. It seems only too much, the burden of my love; I feel I’m just too heavy a weight on those around me. 

I have lost all of my money and savings attempting to regain a sense of control over my life by spending money on groceries, simple things like helping around the house. 

Perhaps my issue is my mental illness I have yet to be diagnosed with, but my therapist seems to not care about any diagnoses of the sort. 

The crushing debt of sadness I get every day from waking up and not being in the dreams that made me feel purposeful and free from life and worries of financial struggle have left me feeling as though any happiness I can achieve is simply that— a dream.

It is selfish, but I lose my will to live more and more; I care little about actually dying, it seems the only person I am afraid to hurt is my beloved, but I fear I can’t stay suffering like this much longer, worrying about money, my worth, the pain of simply living. It has been months coming that I have been wasting away.

 Exercise only distracts my heart when I have someone with me, and the enjoyment fades all too quickly as soon as it begins, so much so before we finish the outing.

Calling some hotline has only left me feeling worse afterwards, but I try my best to hang on, if only out of love for my fiancé.

I feel as though my place in the world should have been found by now, I am still young, but why does my zeal for life flicker like a candle to the wind? I can’t enlighten myself to give much more, I feel. 
I feel the time is coming for my life to end by my own hand, as I can’t reckon enough willpower to handle the listlessness and longing for joy to come back. 

I don’t know when I will do it, but I try to encourage myself to make it to the end of the year, but I sense as though I may not make it to the end of this month."
It honestly feels like people hate me on first sight,"Doesn’t matter if it’s in person or online where I’m nothing but a username. I’m actually feeling like I’m insane and that I’ve done some heinous cat against society that I’ve just forgotten and that’s why people don’t like me. Even if it’s a first impression, before I’ve said literally anything, I am instantly disliked.

To be honest though, I would fucking hate myself too for no reason. If they got to know me they would only hate me 100x more"
Hanging myself tonight so I avoid my birthday and everything else,.
"Does anyone else feel like they are ""meant"" to kill themselves?","I have this weird feeling that I have to kill myself, as I was always going to kill myself. It feels sort of prophetic, like that's what this life had in store for me. I don't know it's strange, anyone else feel this way?"
It just costs too much to live,"I can’t handle poverty any more. Everything is too expensive. I’m afraid to use my heat this winter because the electric bill would be too much. I have a radiator and a pile of blankets, but if I don’t run the heat the pipes will freeze and I can’t pay to fix that if they burst. 

I don’t wanna live because all I do is pay bills. There’s no enjoyment in my life, just constant stress and worry and fear that I’ll end up homeless. 

Everything is a struggle. I have to strategically be late on certain bills so the service doesn’t get shut off but I can pay one thing while I neglect another. Interest on my loans and credit cards makes it so I don’t seem to make progress paying anything back. 

I just can’t take it anymore."
Im surprised with how comfortable the thought of suicide has gotten with me and it scares me.,"The thought of taking my own life has become surprisingly more comfortable/normal . It scares me. I have thought of it before but it was always "" im never going to actually do that."" But now its been cnsuming my thoughts more and more. I feel i have nothing , no one, no purpose. Im useless, i have no where to turn. The silence is deafening and the thought of taking my life just creeps up more and more and it doesnt feel so crazy anymore. This is what scares ne to se ehow my thinking has changed and maybe in a month itll be the only thing i think of. It seems im going that direction
I dont know what to really do. 
I tell nyself im being selfish and i have family that cares for me and theyll be sad but its not convincing me anymore.
i just hate how lonely i feel.
I look around and think what am i doing. Im fooling myself. I try to be happy and joke around with others. Tell myself its all in my head but i feel im losing control. 
im scared.

Edit- sorry lots of grammar and spelling errors. I'm on an old phone thats a little hard to fix"
Anyone ever notice this?,The people who will tell you how much they'd miss you if you killed yourself are the same people who are content to ignore you everyday you're alive.
My boyfriend comes from 3 generations of suicide. He took his life in November 2017. I am really fucking depressed. We have a 7 year old daughter. I feel ill every moment of every day.,"He was my best friend. I have constant nightmares. We struggled so much after his death - I got my daughter involved with a grief center for children in our town. I battled with her school because she got called to the principle’s office and was reprimanded to saying out loud to another student that she was sad at Christmas because she missed her Daddy. That student told their parents and those parents called the school and complained about my daughter upsetting their daughter...She has lots of friends with westerly families and gossipy moms. The rumor went around that her Dad died from a drug overdose (he hung himself) and no one wanted to have play dates anymore or associate with us. 

I worked so hard and advocated for my daughter the best I could. I found every resource possible for her. But I didn’t take any time for myself I guess. My family was very difficult to deal with regarding his death - my mom was extremely against my daughter even being at her Dad’s funeral - it took her counselor from school to tell my mom how important closure would be for my daughter. My mom does not know how to regulate her thoughts or feelings. She also doesn’t want my daughter to have any connection or relationship with her Dad’s side of her family. She got upset and scared that my daughter would choose her Dad’s family over her, which is ridiculous. After her Dad’s death, I brought my daughter to her Dad’s family, across country. My mom flipped out and called child protective services on me. She can’t handle not having control over my daughter.

So I’ve been battling with Child Protective. My mom filed for custody of my daughter. There have been a bunch of recent child deaths in my state and the attention is on DHS and they aren’t fucking around with anything. So even though I’m an amazing mother, have done everything possible to help my daughter with her grief - I’ve now had my role as a parent ripped from me. If you thought those upity moms judged us then, you should see how they judge us now.

I’m done with it all. My daughter is now a stranger to me. It’s been 7 months without her and I really have no purpose in life anymore. I mean, I know my worth but being involved with the State and system rips your entire soul up. 

I have no fucking purpose to live. I understand why her Dad left. I want to leave also. "
Have you ever gotten jealous over hearing about someone's suicide?,"Now i did not personally know this guy, I left my town's school in 6th grade, and he moved to my town about a year or two after so I never went to school with him but I knew of him cause he hung out with my friends from town. Anyway, I am 24 now. A few days ago, I started seeing people posting ""RIP"" statuses on social media, and posting tributes to him with pictures and what not. Apparently, he was really depressed for awhile and finally decided he had had enough. At first I felt bad, and I still do. But then I started to feel really jealous, because since i was 12 i have been clinically depressed and have tried so, so many times in the past decade to kill myself, but it was never successful at it, and not a day has gone by that I haven't wanted to be dead. And apart of me is thinking ""it's not fair that he got to die and i'm still here"". Has anyone else ever felt like this?"
"I don’t want to kill myself, but I still want to die.","I just give up. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel, it won’t get better, I can’t just get through this bit... that’s what people always say, they’ve been telling me things will get better for years. Well they haven’t yet and they never will, because I don’t fucking try to improve my own life, because I don’t care, because I deserve to suffer.

The voices came back strong. I’m starting to agree with them more and more. They’re right, he doesn’t care, no one does. There is no way to get better, no one wants to help, no one will. 

You can’t make it better, so why try. I’m not even good enough to kill myself, I can’t do anything, i just want it to take me. I give up on even trying. I’m just going to walk awayand let it take me."
I'm this fucking close to ending it. [17M] Really Really Really Long. Sorry. Might be graphic. Might get offended. Discretion advised. IDK.,"First of all, I don't know if I need or even want help. Maybe I just want some anonymous people sitting behind computer screens to sympathize with me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now other than venting. My ""life story"" might come out as very very long but its the only way I can express and explain what I'm going through right now. I can't just do a tl;dr for this.

Just to make things clear: My father is an abusive, manipulative, psychopathic, wife-beater, piece of shit. I was/am not abused with the sack of shit, but my mother has been physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially abused.

Here we go (Some parts obscured):

I was born to international parents, as in they are both different nationalities. Upper middle class to lower upper class. NOT ""rich"" because my father doesn't understand how credit cards, loans, mortgages or saving money works. I've moved plenty of times more than I count on my two hands, living in 4 different countries including birth country. I will refer to them as country 1, 2, 3, 4, in order of moving.

I lived in my birth country(1) for about the first half of my life and was the only time period where I genuinely could smile and have fun. I would have play dates with kids who were born at the same hospital(fairly small town), we were all friends even when we grew up and started to go to school. We would have birthday parties at the local laser tag arena, we were in the same drama/theater class (yeah I know), we would go camping together in when we were in boy scouts. We went to the same schools, same sports clubs, same nearly everything. It was the only time where I would wake up in the morning and look forward to the day, and sleep at night without worrying about anything. I didn't notice any abuse at that time until the last few years when I would start to comprehend why my mother was screaming and crying behind a closed door while I tired to sleep at night. Now that I think about it, the majority of my memories from my childhood are those of my mother crying and hurting from the beatings my father gave her. Even if I try to remember the fun times I had with forgotten names and faces, it all gets overwritten by the horrors I witnessed.

My father was somewhat lucky enough to get transferred to country 2 which just so happened to be the birth country of my mother. Despite the sudden transfer, my mother and I agreed to go because my grandparents were there, and just a couple of hours away. My father had to work immediately and so he went a couple months before us because we had to wait for the moving company to arrive and take everything and send it overseas. My mother and I were excited at first because we were going to my mothers homeland, but that excitement faded when we got to the airport. My asshole of a father didn't even show up at the airport leaving a mother and a 9 year old child with a couple suitcases and a box at arrivals because my mother spoke the local language. We managed to get a taxi and got to our apartment building but couldn't get in because we didn't have the security key. The clerk at the front desk were kind enough to let us in and all the way up to the apartment(27th floor). That alone just shows the attitude my father had back then. Since I could somewhat speak and understand the local language, my mother wanted me to go to a local school so I could hone on my language skills, but the school choice was unlucky. The majority of the students there were nice, but the teachers and administration were utter shit. They were plenty of ""fights"" everyday mostly disrupting the class and the administrators couldn't give a shit to actually punish the students enough. I have to admit that I was in some of them as well, nothing too serious, but enough to get me in ""trouble"" as well. A bunch of parents couldn't take it anymore and decided to sue the school or something and well my mother pulled me from the school after one and a half years or so going there. It was a real shame because I actually quite liked my classmates there, excluding the ones that thought it would be funny to fuck with me, but still. After that disaster of a school my mother transferred me into an international school which was okay but I got into a lot of shit for not doing homework and the usual stuff. I made some friends who had mutual interests in some phone games and sports, and since the student population was so small I was friendly with mostly everyone. However, I was already becoming shy and shutting people out of personal things at that point (gets important later). It was at this time when I had actual thoughts of suicide. My friends and I started to get into rooftopping(climbing onto roofs of skyscrapers or just any building, taking pictures etc) and unlike the others, I liked it because of the thrill of one wrong step and death awaits hundreds of feet below. The thrill eventually gave me a sort of high that if I walked of the ledge, I wouldn't have to be burdened by keeping the fact that my father abuses my mother from the world and the only pain I would feel was when I hit the ground hard. Unbeknownst to my friends, I would regularly go solo and just contemplate on the ledges of buildings whether to jump or not, but I never could because I couldn't leave my mother to that scumbag.

Oh did I tell you what my father was doing during this time? After the first couple of weeks of being in country 2, my mother and father got into an argument and then my father just poofed. For 3 years. He would occasionally, emphasis on occasionally, leave cash in an envelope in the mailbox which I guess was ""living expenses"" because my mother didn't work, and my father doesn't understand that you have to pay back your credit card expenses. I never knew about any mental conditions(legit depression) my mother has/had until recently but my mother and I would sometimes go to a therapist, where all I did was play games but my mother would come out teary eyed. I had no clue at the time, but I always regret not knowing sooner.

After a few years in country 2, my father got transferred to country 3 which I wasn't as excited about because then I would be living with the cunt again and dealing with the 24/7 fear of hearing my mother being beat and not being able to prevent it. We got there about when I was around 12, I don't remember completely but by then I was completely shut in and didn't let anyone come near me save a couple of kids who lived in the neighborhood. I was the new kid with a funny/cool accent and was bombarded with questions and stares every time I opened my mouth and had to explain I was born in country 1 and so on. This added to my already shy demeanor because I didn't want people to know my  mother was being beat by my father. I never went emo or goth or that one depressed kid sitting at the back of the room. Never hung out with the wrong crowd. Never did alcohol or drugs. Never got into fights. Hell I barely even talked. Answered questions when only needed. Didn't show any emotions unless absolutely necessary, and that changed me. I started doing things and feeling things of which a sociopath would do(Correct me if I'm wrong I'm not a doctor). I would lie to people to get them to do what I want, i.e. snitch on each other, get people to fight, get out of trouble myself, get better grades in some classes. I even did a bit of blackmailing to both students and teachers. I couldn't care less what happened to other people because the majority of the people at that school only saw me as the quiet kid who has a foreign accent when he rarely talks. I eventually stopped blackmailing at least because the stuff I had wasn't really useful since the worst thing that could happen to the victims were probably a suspension and a warning. I also did a bit of shoplifting and pick pocketing which gave me a thrill due to the absence of buildings higher than the third story where I was at. During my 4 or 5 years of being in country 3, my father would beat my mother so many times I started to have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night and I would barely get any sleep from fear. My heart rate would go up and I would be pumped with adrenaline every time someone raises their voice because I got so used to stepping in and fighting my father when he would try to hurt my mother. My fathers beatings on my mother started to decline whenever I was around because I've put him in a couple of headlocks to subdue him(I can't use my fists or whatever because he looks like an obese pregnant lady, fat absorbs punches \[no offense to overweight people\] and I'm not a fan of breaking my knuckles on a face I'd rather break a bat on a skull).

Now onto recent events, my father transferred again to country 4 where we currently reside in. He actually got here about a year ago, whereas me and my mother only got here about a two months ago just before COVID-19 got big. The reason why my mother and I got here a year late because there were ""problems with immigration"" most likely my father just delaying us coming here because he's a dick. We had to stay with my mothers parents for literally a year which made me miss about 2 years of schooling(I left half way through in Country 3 and different curriculum different term/semester dates messed things up).

I was super depressed and pissed at my father for from my point of view was delaying our travel and immigration to Country 4. I started some online courses to get extra credits just to put on record but got too depressed for that and I am still trying to finish it even though it should have been done before 2020. I started to become a NEET(The japan definition i.e. shut-in). All I would do is watch netflix and youtube, play some games on steam(I'm not a big gamer guy), sleep and eat during the day, and then sneak out at midnight and drink, smoke(cigarettes), hang out with some sketchy guys, ride motorbikes till sunrise, and repeat. I regularly shoplifted and watched a bunch of people get mugged by the group I was with. I didn't do it because I didn't want to get caught with assault but still guilty in most peoples eyes. I cut ties with them after I got back into rooftopping and consequently suicidal again. I know what they and I did were lawfully and morally ""wrong"" but they did distract me from wanting to kill myself. Either way, I found myself sneaking in and climbing skyscrapers again and contemplating whether or not to jump. One time a social worker/volunteer was ""patrolling"" the rooftop I was on (apparently it was ""popular"") and was trying to talk to me out of not jumping and whatnot. What she said actually helped calmed me down somewhat despite what some people think of as ""help""; my death would just be another number in a news story, what about your loved ones, what other paths could you take, that sort of thing. After that encounter I stopped climbing rooftops just to see if it would help how I feel, but it didn't really change anything except that it deprived me of a way to kill myself, I don't want to die painfully. Before I could do anything though, my mother and I were finally able to move to country 4.

That brings us here less than 2 months before me writing this post. As usual all I did was do a bit of online courses, watch some netflix and youtube, play steam games until my laptop starts heating like an oven, eat when I feel like it, sleep when I feel like it, cry a ton, contemplate jumping from my bedroom window in our apartment, then deciding not to because I don't want to die in this country. Then rinse and repeat. Since I was home all day, I only had to worry about my father getting all shouty and violent on weekends because the cunt gets too ""tired"" from work and just sleeps his ass off like the pig he is. Since he knows I can beat his ass easily, he has refrained from getting violent apart from one time where I quickly put him down with some elbows to the head(I had watched some UFC illegal moves compilation). Everything was ""fine"" up until COVID-19 started to hit hard and became a global pandemic. My father is a manager of sorts, so he is now working from home 24/7 and so my anxiety attacks are coming back and fear for my mothers safety is at an all-time high. Today was one of those days where my mother and father got into an argument where I just couldn't stand it anymore with my father berating my mother about being abusive and manipulative when she is the one with bruises and scars from his beating. I nearly fully snapped but I started putting him in a headchoke and punching him and all that and got so close to wanting to shove a knife in his throat but I had hesitated because I didn't want to leave my mother stranded in a foreign country with a dead sack of shit and a kid trying to flee the country. I know I'm smart(arrogant but somewhat true) so I laid off and am now writing this post.

As you could probably tell, the reason why I haven't killed myself or the wife-beating piece-of-shit yet is because of my mother. I love her to death and wouldn't want her to be devastated by my death and be at the mercy of father, or have to deal with a murdering son who's wanted by the cops. I also know that despite the piece-of-shit being a piece-of-shit, he's willing to pay the $55000 \~ 70000(USD) of schooling for 2 years of IB which I will be attending in August if the economy doesn't die and the world doesn't end by then. I know that if I work hard during those 2 years of IB, I could get into colleges and university's I would have never even thought of attending. The logic and reasoning inside me tells me to just wait it out for two years and then I'll be free to do what I want, but the emotional side of me somehow is winning me over after every struggle and fight and telling me to just end it all and not worry about anything. I'm a selfless person to the heart and will most likely always will be because of the way I have lived my life only caring about the well being of myself and my mother, but its just getting too much for me to handle. I'm so close to achieving my dreams of getting into a good college and being free so my mother can divorce his ass but I'm equally as close to just ending it all.

Like I said, I don't know if I'm here posting my whole life story for some sympathy or encouragement to keep going, or just someone to talk to. I don't know. Just want to say thank you to everyone who has put up with reading this long ass essay post. I just don't know.

EDIT: Thanks to all who read and responded. I just woke up after sleeping and crying a ton. I'm feeling a bit better and clearer now after going through the comments.

To those who might be a bit confused, I've begged to my mother to divorce his ass plenty of times. My mother just brushes me off and says she's in this for me. Despite who he really is, he is making bank, and he feels he has some sort of duty to get me through college/university(He didn't go, military and 70's). The reason why I haven't gone to any sort of authority/help yet is because I don't want to waste my mother's time enduring the past 20 or so years being with him by getting him arrested and then me not being able to become successful. Believe me, I have tried to call the cops so many times but my mother stops me every time because she is worried about my future. She wants me to get a good education, get a well-paying job, have a family, and treat them differently than the way my mother and I have been treated, and ultimately be happy. The way I see it, she has sacrificed her life and I don't want to make that sacrifice go in vain. This is the only reason why I haven't gone to authorities or done something or actually ended it yet. Sometimes I beat myself up with shame because the reason/logic side of me knows that it would be a stupid move to kill myself but sometimes everything just feels too heavy for me."

My last day.,Today is my last day. I cant deal with my mental health any longer. Its been 27 years of pure hell. I have only been fighting so others wouldnt be uncomfortable if i killed myself. I wont do it any more. I have great things going for me on the outside but inside me it is my own personal hell. I have done everything to try to overcome this and nothing works. For several reasons. I am terrified to die but it has to be better than the hell i live every second of my life.
"Fuck the future, friends getting houses, a living wage. I'm so tired of feeling hopeless","First off, fuck winter. I'm so tired of spending the entire winter wanting to end it. Its ridiculous.

With the general election coming up, it's just gonna fuck over the country even more and I'm already broke. Like £2 in the bank broke until tomorrow night. And now friends are setting deposits on houses and settling into well paid jobs that are over 20k a year. 

Its just a repeating cycle of hopelessness. Theres literally no chance of not struggling for my entire life and I cant keep dealing with it. I'm so tired of being happy for a day then watching as everything just falls apart around me. 

I'm so fucking tired. I hate my job. I'm too depressed to write my cv since theres nothing positive to say, and I feel stupid for even thinking that. I'm just so done."
I lived,"I wrote a post [On March 19, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fl8n2m/overdosing_soon/) telling anyone who'd listen that I was going to overdose. And I did. 

But I survived, I was in ICU for a while; I had Acute Respiratory Failure With Hypoxia And Hypercapnia; Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy; Heart fucking stopped. And I was on Mechanically Assisted Ventilation via medically induced coma. *I had failed*

When Medical cleared me, I was moved over to the same hospital's psychiatric ward for 11 days. Once discharged, I was then referred to a PHP, today was my second day. 

But today, the idea that Life keeps telling me ""no"" on things I want made me start *planning* again. But not an overdose this time, something more.. permanent. But since I've been on a 5051 previously, (this time I wasn't, I was at the ward voluntary; I need help, I know that much and I'm open to getting it) that plan will be much much harder. 

Still, I am alive and I was doing really good! the meds are working, it's just that stray thought that's just started growing. But I'll bring that up tomorrow in PHP. 

Life might always say No to what I want, and Death said no to my needs.. but fuck you - I'm not saying no to getting help!

*I can't*"
So how long until it “gets better”?,Why should one not consider suicide?
Always changing mind over suicide,Ever had this feeling? One moment you feel a strong resolve to live. Then after a few days it gets bad again and you start planning your suicide. Then after a few days you'll feel good again. Endless cycle. 😩
"I have never had affection in my life, respect or trust, and I was abused and gaslit by my whole family for over 20 years. Suddenly, my brain is convinced that suicide is a realistic option?","Some backstory is needed here.

I'm a girl, in my 20s, who never had friends, and never had affection/basic respect from the whole family and people OR a normal life. Taken for granted and bullied in school.

I was physically and mentally abused mainly by my mom who doesn't like my gender.

Nearly killed by her and from the day I started noticing the gaslighting I also realised my family is made up of abusers or enablers, with people justifying my mother's insaneness even when it happened in front of them...

...telling me it was my fault and ""you are the one who drove her to kill you. You made her miserable"".

Literally the only people I can speak to is my psychologist and web friends, either because I am 100% alone and because I can't even start talking. The only times I hear my voice is during a fight with other narcs of the family.

My only way out is a job. My short term memory is mostly gone so I can't study (I tried, failed, had to leave uni) and I have no hobbies since my mind has no space for anything that isn't survival.

So here I am: familyless, friendless, without an identity, without something that makes me laugh or enjoy life, without a future that I look forward to.

In all of this, my mind is suddenly considering suicide as an OBJECTIVE solution, as the only one. I am scared of this unconsciius thought, if your situation was like mine and you got out of it, I'm listening.

Thank you in advance.



P.S. I see many of you contacted me privately, but that's a lot of you, so don't be upset if I can't answer: I appreciate."
im extremely tired.,"Not even sure if i'll make it past today, im exhausted of living. Im sorry."
I Can Always Just Die After Graduation,"I don't think I want to continue living in this world after I graduate college. I still have over a year left, but I worry about my future every single day. I don't think I'm cut out to live in this highly competitive world. I struggle enough already as a student and have no passions or ideas about what I want to do. I want to exist, but not the way the majority of people in this society have to exist. So, my thoughts go to suicide quite a bit these days. I think to myself, ""I can always just die"" and then I won't have to deal with any of it anymore. I don't want to work my life away. I'd rather just be dead and move on to whatever comes next. I'm just so scared."
Attempted. Got put on antidepressants. Regret not using a more effective method,I hate that I fuckin survived
"what purpose does the world have for an ugly, awkward girl?","Have finally learned my place in life during these times of self-isolation. No one cares what you're doing. No one cares if you're okay. No one cares about whether you are dead or alive. Stay in your lane, you will never be good enough for anyone else. Shut up and just keep to yourself. I can't take this anymore."
Im ugly inside and out,Im a fucking failure. What’s the point of even living a mediocre life ? Even my family dont understand why I’m feeling like this they say I have everything. The thing is I’m disgusting looking I can’t even look at myself in a mirror. Why can’t I die already ? I know people care about me. And I can’t even self harm anymore. I’m constantly crying for no reason. I hate my useless worthless ugly self and I don’t want to live everyday of my life seeing my miserable face. People who care about me they don’t even care or at least they won’t care long. I want to disappear and nobody remembering me. I’m a worthless human being not even good to look at and not talented. A lot of people have it way worse and I’m still complaining which makes me even more pathetic. I hope today it’ll work.
Am I faking being depressed for attention?,"I at this point have started to doubt if I'm just doing everything for attention. I do things like venting to close friends when I'm feeling way too deep down. I sometimes just want to see if they care because a lot of my ""thoughts"" surround the fact that nobody actually cares about me. That everybody hates me. Sometimes I've gotten ""mad"" at people for acting like they don't care. Because everyone says they care but never shows it. I get mad about the fact that they pretend they care cause if they don't, they should just tell me that. Cause deep inside it's what I want. So I can prove to myself that I'm the failure I believe I am. So I can finally kill myself without the guilt. I'm very confused. Am I faking it??"
My 24th birthday is in a few weeks. I made the decision this morning to end my life on that day.,"EDIT: The responses to this post have surprised me a little. I’ve posted about killing myself before bit I’ve never received an overwhelming amount of feedback like I have here.

I regret posting this but not because of the feedback I got but because it was kind of impulsive, though I do feel authentically suicidal frequently. I feel substantially less suicidal as of right now. I’m not going to therapy yet, still not sold on that. But, for now, you’ve talked me away from following through on committing to my bday plans. 

Thank you all very much. I did not deserve your warmth or kindness. Thanks."
i’m killing myself by the end of this week,"i wanted to do it tonight but as i type this, i’m realizing again it’s my older brothers birthday. i don’t want his birthday to be a never ending memory of his 16 year old sister killing herself on the same day.

i’m scared. i know that there’s never an easy way to kill yourself, not unless your assisted but even then it’s not easy especially when it’s illegal. i think i might overdose. i’m just scared of throwing up. maybe that makes me stupid, a coward and stupidly suicidal.

i’m really done. i never realized what people meant when they talked about the mental health care system being shit, i mean, i’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, different kinds of anxieties and borderline personality disorder for the last few years (and didn’t think much of it) until i realized that how i was feeling and acting was FAR from normal so i tried to get help. why wait 3 months for another therapy appointment that never ends up helping, if i can just kill myself in those three months? there’s no point to anything anymore, i have no reason to live. besides, i’ve tried to kill myself twice already. (though, they obviously didn’t work.)

third times a charm, right?

EDIT: i wish i could say that my mental health is the only thing bringing me down. im tired of living in a world where i was sexually assaulted, i’m tired of being abused, i’m tired of having fear of seeing my father and his family. i don’t want pity, i really am just tired. i’m scared of myself and the future"
I crochet a blanket for my boyfriend to say goodbye,I have been planning my suicide for a while now and today is finally the day I will be happy. A couple of months ago I asked my boyfriend to choose a colour palette but I didn't tell him that it was for the colours of yarn I will use to make a blanket for him as a goodbye gift. I've been working really hard on this blanket and trying to make it perfect. Before I wrap it I will spray it with my perfume that I always wear and tuck the bottle in the blanket so he can spray it on whenever it loses the smell. With it I will also write a letter to explain why I'm giving him this gift.
Why do so many people get to die by accident and for me to die I have to kill myself.,Fuck
"It feels weird when I remember that suicide is such a scary thing for most people to discuss. I keep forgetting that most people aren't suicidal, and that even the slightest mention of it can make them panic.","At this point I've been suicidal for so long that it's just part of my life. It feels like you have your job, your hobbies, etc, and your suicidal thoughts. Apparently not for most people though.

Anytime anyone ever finds out that I'm suicidal, I'm actually pretty surprised by how much of a reaction it inspires in them."
"I don't understand the phrase ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem""",Is a permanent solution not what I want? I don't a temporary solution that will only work temporarily.
i am genuinely proud of this sub reddit,"i honestly want to say something, i am happy that people are trying to help each other. Online or offline, This is just the best thing."
I want to Die!!,"&#x200B;

I so badly want to die, Everyday I pray that my life will end but it never does.

Im not afraid to kill myself, Its guilt that is stopping me but that is wearing thin.

does anyone else ever felt better after writing a suicide note/planning?,"(Copied and pasted from r/depression)

I’ve had a long history of the crazies. I’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another. But the other night I spent hours researching suicide methods (I don’t have easy access to my gun anymore, which was my main plan last year, since I’m at college) and I wrote out a note and everything, then fell asleep. The next day was the best I’d felt in months honestly. It was weird. I’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal I’ve been since before I got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer...probably a bad idea but I don’t like being numb) and then the next day I was social, I talked to people, I felt actually okay. It was weird. I went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. I know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? Like I don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because I mean I still want to kill myself, I’m not better. But I’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced the same sort of feeling. Sorry if this is dumb. I’m tired."
(Not suicide) Just a thank you,"Hey guys of SW, just everyone out there. Just thanks to all the repliers that help out all the people in need. This subreddits saves lives And as a replier myself, I know how many people that gets talked to and helped out... It's amazing, to have this out there you know. Thanks for this subreddits"
"I drove to the gun store , parked , and drove back home","Was having such a hard time with depression. I made the decision I was going to go to the gun store and kill myself the next day (last night). Woke up , took a shower , got dressed and built up the courage to go... I got in the car and put the nearest gun shop in my gps. Not playing any music whatsoever on my ride there, total silence for the 13 minute drive. Mind racing 300mph. I parked next to the store and was trembling with fear , there it was the gun store. I tried to unlock my seatbelt and my hand was shaking. I was able to unlock my seatbelt , but that was it. I didn’t have the strength to get out the car and go inside. I ended up crying and calling my cousin asking if i could spend a few days at his house because I’m at a low point and I live all by myself. He said of course and so i turned the car back on drove back home packed a bag and headed to his house . I’m here at his house now and we just got dinner with his kids. I still feel like utter shit and want to die but something in me wouldn’t let me pull the trigger ( no pun intended). A small voice in my head is proud of me ..... but I’m still fighting this war of suicidal ideation and depression constantly and I feel like I’m losing . Just had to share with Someone."
"Failed 20 years ago, about to give it another try","I was depressed 20 years ago, OD'd and was found by my roommate, 20 years later and I live alone, have more effective means and while not depressed, I just dont care anymore.  I was sad then, Im numb now and nothing has changed other than the fact that I could die and nobody will look for me until I bills stop getting paid (how fucked is that?)  Not looking for help, just writing it down for people to see that it doesnt always get better and sometimes is gets worse."
All I think about is suicide and video games.,"The title says it all. Every relationship in my life is decaying because of it. I don't talk to people much anymore. I just want my video games. If I'm not absorbed in a video game, I'm thinking about dying. Had a handful of close calls this year..."
Telling me to exercise and pick up a hobby does not make me less suicidal than I already am. Don’t feed me cliche bullshit.,"I get it. There is nothing else that anybody can say to fix your past traumas that leak into the present or your ongoing troubles. I’m just sick of being told generic bullshit. “Fall back on old hobbies”. “What are your interests?”. Does it ever occur to you that when I’m depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation, it’s because nothing sparks joy in me anymore? I no longer have a) hobbies anymore or; b) no energy to carry out those hobbies. Telling me to go for a walk is unrealistic when I’m afraid to even get out of bed in the first place and leave my room because if I do, I’m afraid of what I’m capable of doing to myself and afraid of acting on my intrusive thoughts. Why am I afraid? I don’t fear death in itself but I fear dying. The pain involved in dying. The agony. The fear of it not working. Telling me to “oh eat your favourite food”, doesn’t fucking help. I have no appetite and I unintentionally starve myself. When I try to eat the smallest amount, I can’t help but almost vomit. Time doesn’t heal all and I hate being told that it does. Shit has gotten worse over time and I’m sick of people saying you have to have patience. Says fucking who? I don’t have to do shit and even then I did for the sake of other people. Not everything is a happy ending and people need to just accept that fucking fact. We aren’t always going to get closure. Some people just are played the unfortunate cards in life and that’s how it just fucking is. Whether you admit it or not, not everybody is going to fall to some happy ending fairytale bullshit and that’s the harsh truth of reality. Don’t tell me to go outside and enjoy nature. Looking at a bunch of leaves won’t magically make me not want to kill myself and won’t cure fucking anything. I need proper help but there’s nothing out there aside from “discover your interests”. Who the fuck cares. That’s just another way of distracting yourself from the problem and running away from it, not actively sorting it out because nothing can fix it. Irreversible damage and people act like going for a run or having a warm bath will fucking change anything. Cliche as fuck. I hate this life. I wish I was dead. Nobody gives a shit until then anyway, nobody takes anyone seriously until you’re dead and even then, they forget about you within a while anyway and don’t tell me that isn’t true. They do. Because it’s human nature to be able to grieve and move on, it’s within our innate tendencies to do so. Fuck this “life”. Living and exisiting are two very different things. Living means to feel alive and I’m purely existing. “Alive” in the sense that I’m breathing but I’m dead inside. Please let me fucking go."
"Life is shit and we all know it, I wish I could stop existing","Life is a meaningless piece of shit. I hate everyone and everything. Life is so fucked and unfair, and yes people say ""But you are not doing this, you're not doing that, you feel like shit, because of yourself and all that crap."", but let me tell you something: I've been doing everything that people have been telling me such as consistently working out, running, creating a schedule, affirmations, self-help books which are worthless and doesn't help, take a walk, listen to podcasts, doing nofap, etc.

Nothing is helping and I don't want to live. The only reason I'm still alive is my new friends, they're my only inspiration, besides I don't give a shit, this world is full of crap. I'm tired of existing, it's so painful and meaningless, and maybe I'm lashing out right now and start to cry, but it feels good. Sorry all you people who've read it."
Anyone else wish they could hire a hit man for themselves?,"Throwaway account FYI.  But I don’t want to live anymore.  I’m 21M with an STD that I haven’t gotten diagnosed cause I’m scared.  

It sucks, I know I would never kill myself.  That would destroy my family.  But I wish I could pay a professional assassin to kill me within 6 months or something.

I don’t want to see it coming, I just want to be shot in the back of the head without knowing it.  Just poof, and be dead.

"getting bullied for painful crippling disease, going to gun stores regularly","When I was in the 10th grade I started to lose my memory and developed painful symptoms in my limbs, I immediately knew it was extremely serious and possibly terminal. Every few months I would get more sick and it has remained that way for the past 6 years I have been getting worse every few months.

My disease has become so severe that I cannot continue school or study from cognitive impairment, I can barely eat anything without getting pain and it is impossible to gain any weight.I can barely walk outside because of shortness of breath, I cannot leave the house in the summer.the disease is extremely painful and disabling every day is a battle with pain, and controlling symptoms.

several doctors have diagnosed me with a neurological disease which they say is untreatable and not curable.

so for the past few weeks I have been visiting gun shops while I lie to my parents and tell them I am going to the gym.

everyone treats me like crap especially my parents.

my body has reached its physical limits, I cannot endure any more pain from the disease it is impossible, so I am going to buy guns and kill myself."
The first day after is really weird [TW: Suicide Attempt],"So last night I tried to kill myself. I had every intention on doing so. I was sitting in my car with my gun to my chin and I pulled the trigger but nothing happened. I usually keep a round in the chamber when I carry, so didn't think to rack the slide, instead I just cocked the hammer back. For whatever reason, maybe it was because I wasn't thinking straight, I never racked it after loading the magazine. So when I pulled the trigger, no bullet came out, and it was the loudest click I have ever heard in my life. O drove home and gave my roommate (who is also my best friend) my gun and I told him what happened. I cried, he cried, and he asked me to sleep in his bed with him so he would know I was there. I don't know how but I managed to sleep. But now, everything just feels off. I can't look people in the face, it's hard to concentrate at work, I don't know what to say to anyone. I wasn't supposed to be here today. People are telling me go to a doctor, but I don't want to, I've been through that before and it doesn't help. If you're reading this, thank you. I just needed a place where I could say what happened and not be judged or baker-acted or something."
constantly flooded with memories and thoughts of every mistake in my life.,"i just want to sleep but i can’t. every time i close my eyes it’s something shitty that’s happened to me or something shitty or stupid that i’ve done / said.

so i sit awake and cry and panic and i can’t function.

my mental health has always been a disaster but it really feels like non-stop deterioration at this point.

i hate that i never have anything new to say. i can’t articulate anything so it’s just the same old “i don’t want to be here anymore why can’t i get the guts to end it already” over and over.

i’m so miserable and so tired of being ALONE.

i know that i have love and good in my heart to give to people but i’m so fucking stupid i just can’t talk to anyone.

i know it’s never going to end until i do it. i know i will never meet someone who will stay. i know there’s no point. i just want to die."
Do you ever wonder how other people aren’t suicidal?,I find it hard to believe that there are actually people out there who like themselves and enjoy life and don’t want to kill themselves. Wow. 
I'm a pedophile and I deserve to die,I wanna die so much. I've never done anything to a kid and I never would but I hate myself so much for my desires. It's also fucking awful to know that I'll never be able to be sexually or romantically satisfied. I feel like I'll never be happy. I'm so scared I'm gonna hurt a kid and I actively avoid them. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like tonight is a good night. It's Sunday and I'm alone. I'm eating my favorite dinner. 
My dog died,"He was such a good boy fuck I just can't anymore, I'm done with fucking everything"
My father took his own life 2 days ago.,I cannot believe he did this. I loved him so much and now he's gone forever. I have my brother and my mother but still I'll be lost and alone forever. I am so sad that I will never laugh with him again or see him. I fucking hate it. It was so unexpected. I wanted him to get old and see my kids. There's no one I can talk to like him. :(
Fuck me,"I just want to go to sleep, and never wake up"
“I hope my death makes more sense than my life.”,Quote from Joker. Feeling depressed today. Bipolar is a bitch. Felt like sharing.
"I am a loser, a big failure and forever will be.","I have always been unable to talk with people. I've had no friends ever, fuck I can't even talk to most of my family. I didn't think much of it when I was younger. But now I'm going to college and it's hitting me hard how much of a failure I am. I dropped out of my first one because of crippling anxiety. Now I joined another one far from home. Now I feel trapped. I'm scared of humans. I look at myself in the mirror and I see an ugly subhuman being unworthy of any love or respect. I know if I go on I won't be a success in life, I won't be happy, I will always be scared of everything and depressed all the time. My mind is too fucked up over the years that I don't think it's even possible to cure. All I can think of now is death. It gives me relief to think of it. So I will soon drive off into a lake and die and hopefully make it look like an accident.

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words guys. Even though I don't know a single one of you, it feels good that some of you can understand what I've been going through all my life and took the time to respond to me."
"A thing about me. Please, if you have the time, please read it. I just want to let things out.","I'm posting this here because I just need a place to scream. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm just not built for this world. If maybe I'm not mentally strong enough to take on anything and if maybe I should just take my life because I feel like I cant accomplish anything.

Anyways, hi, my name is Autumn, I'm 19 y/o transgirl and I graduated high school last year. As far as I'm aware provided my psychologist and psychiatrist are correct I have Borderline Personality Disorder, Asperger's Syndrome, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I've always had a hard time growing up. I was bullied so much in school, my parents werent the best, they physically abused me when I was a child, and mentally abused me in middle/high school. A part of me doesnt hate them (at least my mother) because I feel like they're not trying to hurt me nor do they hate me, they just dont know how to properly raise me or approach me. They just decided to go the ""old school"" route of hitting me until I got better grades. Anyways, I hate my father. He's a manchild with anger issues who does destructive things and I wish he would just disappear. 

Anyways, onto my personal life with friends. I am severely emotionally unstable, I experience things in extremes and I always constantly split between loving and hating my friends. I constantly fear being abandoned or left alone and result in drastic measures to avoid those situations, I selfharm, I spend so much money. Haha, I had a job with an income of 1.6k monthly without any bonus commission, but I'd spend all of it on everything. I cant control it. I always ended up burning bridges with my friendships, I didn't mean to, I dont want to. But I cant control my behaviors and I hate it. I'm trying real hard to go to therapy, I'm hoping I can start DBT to help me with my BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder).

I just want to have friends I interact with on a regular basis and play games with. I try my best to reach out but I guess others are busy playing with their friends or just overall not noticing me. Which can really hurt I guess. One recent thing I've really gotten into is FFXIV. I try to ask other friends to play but, I just get ignored and such. It hurts a lot. I dont hate them I think, I dont. I just, I wish I had friends they have and play with. It gets really boring and lonely. Aside from those things, sometimes, I wonder if everything would be better if I was dead. You see, I never knew escapism existed until a few months ago, and that's when I realized how for the past 19 years my coping mechanism of constantly retreating to the fantasy world I've created in my head was extremely unhealthy, and because of it I dont see any reason in going on, I think what's stopping me now is how Ill informed I am with taking my own life and how afraid I am of coming out with permanent damage and not death. Aside from that, there are 2 other people whom I love very much and cant bear to leave alone. My dream job is to edit videos for a YouTube channel or do something game grumps-esque with a friend. I'd love that so much, but that's just a dream, given the current state of YouTube and everything like that, the chances are that's not going to happen. Sometimes I just wish I could fall into a permanent sleep and live forever in my dreams.

Anyways, thanks for letting me rumble a bit. I'm not happy. I'm not okay. I dont want to be alive. But maybe i can make it through, i just sometimes wish i had friends like others I see, but I'm extremely shy and suck at conversation and such, its really hard. I think I'm going to go cry some more now, I'll see you all some other time. 

If you took the time to read through all this, thank you... from the bottom of my heart."
I wish humanity would burn to ashes.,"I hate society and its concepts of virtue and success.

It's telling that it's taken an outbreak upending everything in society as we know it for people to start recognizing fucked up things.

Suddenly, some employers are implementing much more reasonable policies to allow their employees to work from or just stay at home.

Standardized testing requirements in some places has been suspended, almost like they've finally realized there are more important things on the line. Not that that matters to me, because I'm a college dropout that sees degrees as badges of blind obedience.

Carbon emissions have dramatically decreased. Don't know the full facts, but I've heard that air quality in notorious places like China is actually somewhat breathable now.

So I hate when people tell me things like how it gets better, or how I'm going to be successful. Everyone beats around the bush. No one wants to admit that I'm a horrible and talentless person that just hates everyone and everything. I wish humanity would burn to ashes.

I dropped out of college 3 years ago and I've been living with my parents since then. I have no job and don't really do much from day to day. About the only passion I have in life is video games, and I've recently found enjoyment writing reviews and overviews of RPGs on a personal blog. Of course, because I don't know shit about promoting it, it's never going to take off in views and I'll never be able to actually TAKE that passion anywhere.

So, as someone who's dead weight right now, this pandemic is essentially what I've wanted. A disaster that grinds human society to a screeching halt, so I don't have to feel guilty about being cooped up in my room all day instead of trying to throw myself at a wage slave job.

And yet it hasn't changed a thing for me. I still hate myself for even thinking such toxic things. I'm still useless. I still have no future. With each passing day, the feeling that I'm running out of time and have to die soon gets stronger.

The funny thing is that I see a lot of people feeling guilty for doing nothing all day but playing video games. Ironically, that's the life I've always WANTED. If I didn't have to worry about things like school, grades, finding a job, and so on, I could live at my own pace. I'd read more books, learn random interesting topics, immerse myself into human culture, and learn more about the world on top of further exploring my passion for gaming. And you could argue that I could do ALL of that stuff right now since I'm not attending school and don't have a job. But the constant internal reminder that I'm a waste of resources stops me from doing that. The thought process is that I'm going to kill myself in the future anyways, so why bother?

I was so close to the finish line. One of my current ""obligations"", if you can call it that, is that I've pre-ordered two copies of the upcoming Final Fantasy VII Remake. One for myself, and one for a friend who paid me to get his copy since he couldn't pre-order it himself for certain reasons. The plan was that once that favor was done, and once I've gotten a chance to finish the game myself, I could finally let myself die. 2020 would be the final chapter to my pathetic story. There were lots of other games that I'm excited for this year that I was willing to give up on waiting for because I wanted to kill myself before June.

But this pandemic has ultimately taken that away from me. The shelter-at-home orders mean that I'm never going to be completely alone in the house, so I can't just attempt a suicide without any huge risks. And even if I DID pull it off, the last thing I'd want is for the funeral/corpse disposal to be complicated because of this outbreak.

The one silver lining is that I'll now get a chance to play upcoming games like Xenoblade Definitive Edition and Trails of Cold Steel IV before the time comes for me to kill myself. But I'm not sure that means much when I'm a terrible person holding so much hate for humanity inside of me, as well as the general sense that I'm trapped in a corner because I'm a college dropout with no job, no future, and no way to escape a life of wage slavery and overwork other than suicide.

I hate the fact that I always seem to have trouble putting my feelings into words, too. I've been looking through and editing this post multiple times just to try and get everything down. Why is it that I have so much that I want to bitch about sometimes, yet when I have the opportunity to write or speak about it, the words simply evaporate like dry ice?

Deep down, I secretly wish someone would finally just man up and tell me that I'm useless, rude, and toxic. To me, finally hearing someone tell me that I'm a bad person will make it feel like I finally have permission to die."
Im 13 and I want to die,"I have severe anxiety and depression, my parents are separated and that's not helping. I've been depressed for 2 years and I've finally broken down and almost jumped off my balcony, what do I do?"
"I despise when mentally healthy people say ""go see a therapist""",Tehehe omg why didn't I think of that sooner. I'll just go see a therapist and they'll give me the magic antidote to my perpetual cravings for death that have persisted for years. Thanks mentally healthy individual.
I want out of the rat race,Haven’t even started and I don’t want to.  I don’t care about my “potential”.  I’d rather just not exist.
The annoying lexicon of suicide dissuasion,"If anyone out here is legitimately on the verge of a crisis and seeking the slightest nudge of a signal from the universe that they ought to just go through with it, I'd strongly urge them to not read any further because I would never dream of being that catalyst to anyone. I'm a miserable, wretched and broken person with the unfortunate burden of being paralytically self-aware which makes me incapable of doing anything that I can poke holes of rationality in.

I fucking hate the entire existing system and lexicon of suicide-support. The hollow meaningless and empty cliched routine that everyone instantly spews at you is just nauseating to me. In a strange way I think it is an effective deterrent because the second someone hears words like ""you're not the only one going through this"" or ""you have so much to live for"" or ""things will get better"", I imagine that even at least a tiny part of their brains is so revolted by what they hear that they're momentarily distracted from their hopes to end it all. For gods fucking sake could people shut the fuck up for one second and stop talking to me like I'm a fragile little toddler having the news of my parents impending divorce broken to me or something?

If you'll bear with me and be patient, let me explain myself. We're all fully realized, functioning adults here. We don't get to the point of contemplating suicide because our favorite boyband broke up. We don't need banal paltry consolation from random strangers on the internet who will say to us ""Your'e not alone, we understand"", before vanishing and never having any form of meaningful contact with us again. What is the point of some arbitrary words of kindness from a person who has absolutely nothing to do with your life? The reason we're in this fucking mess here is because of people in OUR own lives, tragedies in OUR own lives, failures, loss, heartbreak, devastation, clinical  depression that you can't afford to treat and even if you could afford to treat it, the side effects of the medication include even more suicidal thoughts. 

I wish people would just respect that we all have our own troubled journeys and we all have our reasons for posting here. It is incredibly short-sighted, offensively stupid and patronizing for someone else who has no idea what you have been through to just tell you that everything is going to be hunky dory. I wish people would just say ""You know what, I hear you. I get it. You do what you need to."" Because that to me is exponentially more empathetic, meaningful, profound and compassionate than the typical ""no you're wrong, stop what you're doing, think of everyone who will miss you"" bullshit approach.

That's even the thing that bothers me so much about professional help. I'm literally dying here, dragging my disgusting raggedy corpse out of bed every day is pure agony, I physically cannot even cry any more because I'm so dehydrated from all the crying from the night before, the only reason I get out of bed is to go take a piss after jerking off 14 times a day for the temporary 30-second high of endorphins it gives me that is enough to get me to walk to the fridge and drink some expired orange juice. And a stranger has the audacity to tell me that it's entirely my responsibility to work even harder to save even more money and to seek out a professional therapist to talk to. Do you see what's inherently fucked up about that? It's not the responsibility of indifferent parents who know so little about you that they wouldn't understand 90&#37; of your suicide note if you left them one. It's not the responsibility of the people who treated you like shit, of your friends who haven't noticed anything was wrong in over 6 years and who wouldn't ever even know you were dead because your facebook profile would still be up. There's nobody. It's all you. YOU ALONE are expected to try even harder when you can barely walk, you weigh 15 pounds, your hair is falling out, your teeth are loose, it is your responsibility to seek help. 

Let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say that the very problem that I have is that I have nobody in my life who would WANT to talk to me of their own accord. That's my problem - that nobody wants to talk to me. Then how is the solution to that problem to PAY somebody to talk to me? That simply furthers the problem by reinforcing the point. That even a designated ""helper"" will only talk to me if I incentivize them with money. And so the problem persists. I don't want a shrink. I don't want random strangers who spew meaningless well wishes just so they can feel warm and fuzzy inside and imagine they helped someone somewhere across the world. I just want people to be fucking honest and real for one solitary second and say ""Damn dude. Shit sounds rough. I honestly don't know what I'd do if I were in your position. If you think killing yourself is the most viable option you have - I guess you've probably already considered every other alternative. You do you. Godspeed."" That would mean the world to me. That would be such a pure, profound, refreshingly objective thought. And that would help more than any of the other sugar-coated infantile nonsense.

We're fucking people. We still have to work hard every day to even afford to pay the electricity bills and the internet bills so we can come on Reddit and navigate to Suicide Watch and type a post here. We're not goddamn idiots who are gullible enough to think everything is all unicorns and rainbows just cause a stranger tells us that our parents will miss us when we're gone. Some of us have shitty fucking parents or no parents at all. Some off our corpses won't be discovered for months because we're just that lonely and nobody in our lives gives two fifths of a fuck about us to even wonder if something is wrong if we don't answer our phones a couple of times. Some of us are ONLY still alive because our cats need to be fed and if we were gone, they'd end up in a shelter because we have nobody else who would take them in. 

I don't know man. I've rambled on long enough and probably incited enough downvotes by this point. I just wish people didn't have such a simplistic view of things. It's not like you can walk up to a depressed person and say ""hey don't be sad"" and they'll be like ""omg wow! i never saw it that way before! i'm all better now!"". You can't go up to a suicidal person and say ""hey, don't kill yourself."" It'd be so much better if you could say ""hey, I get it. I'm sorry. Maybe nobody in your life will miss you. I probably won't miss you either. But I do hope you make it out of this sometime."""
I love you all,"You guys are practically my second family, even though we share the same pain, you guys have no idea how much you help not only me but many others that goes through these thoughts, this sub has prevented me from ending it many times, just knowing that whenever i feel sad i can come here and relate to so many people and people are whiling to help you, is really overwhelming, so thank you all for being awesome, hopefully one day we can find peace, even if it seams cloudy and rainy outside."
Only staying alive for others at this point,"My mother is everything to me, if I was to kill myself it would destroy her. She lost her husband last year and I'm basically the only thing she lives for now. 

I'm basically a failure at life, I'm 24 years old, only ever had 2 temporary jobs. Never had a girlfriend. I have some friends but none of them would consider me as their best friend, even though I consider them as mine. 

In society, my family are seen as outcasts and people act as if we are beneath them. I feel like a failure to my mother when she's speaking to somebody in public as I've achieved nothing in my lifetime. 

These thoughts enter my head daily, I want a way out but I couldn't do it to my family. If there's ever a purpose for my death or a situation where I may need to die in place of someone else, I'm taking it."
Just lost my virginity to a prostitute,"And I gave her all my 450$ i feel so awful it was nothing special, and she was not even cute and in fact very chubby, I just wanted to know what was sex like as a 28 old very old lonely man... I'm so depressed I dont have a good stable I just want to know what is the best way to killmyself.."
I’m currently looking at train tracks from a bridge,"One moment I am so ready to throw myself on those tracks, the next the fear comes in and I’m terrified. I’ve been standing here for about an hour. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be here. It is terrifying but the urge to just get it over with is so strong. I’ve waited so long for things to change and it just seems like it’s not going to happen for me. I would rather not have to live in agony every day. I wish there was an easier way to do this. I’m just waiting for a fast enough train to come along so I’ll be sure it’ll be instant. But I’m scared

edit - I’m still here, I was too scared to do it"
"I've meticulously planned everything to the last detail, but whenever they ask me if I have a plan I say no","Such a useless question. You can spend 45 minutes talking about how much you wanna die but if you answer no to that one question they don't think it's serious. If you DO say yes they take all your stuff and lock you in a room where you're nothing but a barcode (a literal barcode on your wrist) that they can scan to make sure your misery is expensive enough. 


Then you lie your way out and go back to the world feeling the exact same way at best, but more likely a lot worse. 


Mental health care is an absolute joke. It's literally just trial and error and if anyone says differently they're lying. Not only that but they're incentivized to make it take as long as possible so healthcare companies make more money. 


Doctors have been throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks for 5 years for me and nothing has. No medicine, therapy, group, whatever. Literally nothing has worked and nothing will.


I wanna just throw all my bullshit waste of money meds in the trash, hop in my car and drive across the country and kill myself there if I have to."
I wish I died instead of my brother,"It's really not fair. I've been wanting to die for years. My brother had everything. He was happy. He was a good man. He liked living. Then he died in a car crash. Why him? It should've been me.
I don't care about anything and I don't want anything. I'll never achieve anything. I don't have the motivation nor ambition. If I suicide my family will suffer too much, but at the same time I don't want to go on. I wish I could believe in destiny or paradise or greater meaning of everything, but Idk, it just seems like life keeps getting worse."
I am sorry mom and dad.,"I want C. to take care of my dog.  

I want my father and mother to take over my house. If they don’t want the responsibility, then I wish for them to sell the home and keep the money. Because they gave me a second chance at life and put resources into me. It’s the least I can do, allow them to recoup something. I know they would rather have me, they never failed me, but unfortunately I cannot go on anymore.

My snap-on toolbox should be given to R.. He can keep my tools.

My biological mother L. will get half of my personal belongings, clothes and anything that will help her keep the memories of me.

Anything else that I own will be donated or thrown away.  

This is nobodies fault. So many friends, family, and doctors tried their hardest to save me. Please know it’s not your fault. Please forgive me. I know that people will question my actions. People will wish I pushed harder and not have done this. I have been in despair for so many years. Suffering silently and trying my hardest to get better; to have peace. I unfortunately couldn’t bear the weight of my mental illness. It changed me, ripped away every fiber of my being. Left me broken and unrecognizable. I lost everything I love to my sickness. I look in the mirror daily and have no idea who I am. All I see is a deeply broken man. I ask that you keep the memories of me for who I was. The unbroken A.. The comforter, the loving person, the selfless A., the man who breaks bread with strangers in need, the one full of compassion and unconditional love. Please don’t remember me for the monster I have become. The angry man, having no patience or control, selfish and hurtful towards those I love; bipolar. I cannot bear that reality. Knowing that I am not me anymore. No matter how hard I try, the A. I once was is dead. I miss his softness, his love, his intellect, his ability to understand and protect others. All I am left with is a shell. I look like A.. But I assure you, he is completely dead inside. Nothing is left of him. No matter how hard I try, I cannot revive him. He is gone, and I carry the weight of who I once was. No more am I actually alive, my fire is gone, my will to live completely destroyed. I am just a shell now. I have unbearable headaches daily. I can’t speak with articulate words anymore. My emotions are numb now. I don’t feel anything. My mind whispers daily that relief will come only when I give up.  That my peace will come when I quit. I have never been a quitter, I have always been a fighter. But for the first time in my life, I face an enemy whom I cannot defeat. My mind is my enemy now instead of my best friend, as it used to be. I know that people will think I am selfish. I ask you to please not carry this pain. It’s unbearable and not worthy to carry. I wish this cup was not mine to drink from, but the poison has come to me anyways. I know that nobody will get to ask me why? Or find the closure they seek. Please find closure in this fact. I am sick, if I wasn’t sick I wouldn’t have taken my life. I couldn’t bear this weight anymore. It has destroyed and taken from me everything that I am. My ability to think, my emotions to feel, my fire, my life. It has taken everything that I was. Nothing is left of me that is me. I wish I could kill what’s wrong with me and still live. But the reality is that I cannot. Please forgive me and allow me the dignity to be remembered for who I was, not what I became. It gives me great shame to know what I am now. To know that my smile is nothing but a mask, my eyes an ocean of despair. I have tried the medications, the therapy, held on to hope. But nothing will fix this. Just as cancer takes over a man and steals his life. So it is with my severe mental illness. This is a cancer, invisible, in the mind. Nothing can cured this. Nothing could have prevented this. I lived a good life. I traveled and felt the world beneath my feet, met good people everywhere I went, and it was beautiful. My life was not lived in vain. I was given a second chance by my parents and they showed me love and compassion. They showed me how to live again. I will forever be thankful for them and the sacrifices they made for a stranger, as they consider me their own child. My life would not have had joy or love without my family. I wish this illness never happened. I have overcome so much in life, but I couldn’t overcome this.  

Sincerely,

A.

I know this will hurt, please know it’s not your fault, it’s nobodies fault. With the last piece of love left in my heart, though it is not much, I wish to share it with everyone who knew me. No matter if we had problems, I forgive you, please forgive me."
My Suicide Note.," 

I don’t feel as if I need to really explain much; you knew I was suffering. 

Admittedly or not; you knew. 

And you can say I’m selfish.

And you can say that I’m a coward. 

And you can say that I couldn’t have been helped.

And you can say that this mindset was a choice.

And that you don’t understand.

And that you didn’t expect this. 

And that you wish things were different.

And that you’re hurting. 

But you’ll be okay. 

And I’m not selfish. 

And I’m not a coward. 

And you’re right, maybe I could’ve been saved; but I wasn’t. 

Someone once told me that I wasn’t broken, that I just needed someone to choose me. To love me. 

And that’s more than true. 

How can I feel secure and purposeful and worthy when my own parents didn’t want to be in my life? 

Everyone that matters sees this light in me; including my parents. 

That I’m special. 

I am luminous. 

I am warm.

I am beautiful.

I am talented. 

I am smart. 

I am magnetic.

I am powerful. 

But at the end of the day, they choose to remove themselves. To enjoy my presence like an heirloom in the back of the hutch. 

Only ever touched for your own gain, your own pleasure, 

Just so show that you have me. 

But my beauty, my accomplishments—those are all mine. 

And I was left alone nonetheless at the end of each day, each week, each month. 

Beautiful they say, precious even. 

Kept safe. Appreciated. 

Used when deemed appropriate. 

Treated with care, sure, for the most part—  

When treated at all. 

Packed away. 

And it’s fine that you guys couldn’t be bothered much.

I tried to give myself meaning. 

To feel loved without touch. 

But when the only touch I can remember is that of those who have only ever hurt me, 

And my voice muted 

My pain overlooked

My cracks sanded over, but never filled

What could really be expected?

My mother HURT ME. 

She hurt some of you. 

She hurt herself. 

And the elephant in the room is that we’re all fucked up because of it. 

IM fucked up because of it. 

I remember. 

I remember.

I remember. 

I FUCKING REMEMBER. 

I wish you’d let me talk about it.

I wish you would’ve be angry with me for hurting.

I wish that crying was acceptable and not a sign of weakness in our home. 

I wish that I was never told that I was the downfall of our family. 

Because I wasn’t. 

And news flash: my mother wasn’t either. 

WHAT HAPPENED to her was. 

And I wasn’t alive yet. I don’t know what happened to her. 

But something did. And YOU know. 

So please, on my literal dead body, fucking talk about it. 

Let this be a lesson. Not about how you treated me, because that’s not what I’m getting at. This ain’t about me. 

Let this be a lesson about truth. About honesty. 

Talk about your traumas. 

I made my own decision, I did. 

Talk so each other. 

Please. 

I tried. 

I tried to take the broken pieces, the wholesome ones, the dark, and light, the beautiful, the confusing, the questionable, the hurtful, and loving, the wrong and the right pieces and to make something of myself. 

I tried to create something with what I had.

To play the cards I was dealt… 

but Rayvaun if anyone knows I’m awful at card games (did I just joke in my suicide note? yeah I think I did). 

Maybe you guys will be able to use this as a card in your hand, or a piece to your puzzle, 

but the game didn’t make sense to me; the pieces just didn’t fit. 

So I folded. 

I’m not sorry for what I did, unfortunately. 

I think this is what I needed and what you guys needed too; you’ll see. 

God sent me here to teach a lesson. 

About truth. 

About pain. 

About compassion. 

About how time doesn’t stop. 

Or something, I don’t know. 

I don’t have much else to say. 

I hope that when it’s dark out, you feel me in the chill of the wind

That when it’s sunny, you can see me and feel my warmth on your skin 

When the ocean comes and goes, you imagine my curls in the air… free, unapologetic. 

I wish that Kevin could know how much I love him. 

Please take care of him. 

He’s an angel. Truly. 

Here’s to best chances 

At peace 

At closure 

At warmth

At forgiveness 

Cause when your new eyes meet mine, you won’t see

No lies 

Just love 

Like snow 

Like gold

I will be pure.

Is anyone else tired of life but too scared to kill themselves?,"Like I’m too scared of what happens after I die so idk

Edit: So I got a bible verse and a lot of religious shit from a guy in the dms, I don’t know if ai should turn to religion for comfort tho"
How the fuck do you hold conversation?,"I have this problem where I can't really make any new friends thanks to me, failing to hold conversation. I'm sick of relying other people to be very talkative and just responding with filler words. Ive been stuck with the same friends for years. Don't get me wrong I'm thankful to have them in the first place but I feel like I'm starting to grow apart from them. I feel so alone and its all my fault. Thanks to me, struggling with meeting new people, keep eye contact, talk until you're comfortable with them etc. There are times where I just feel like I rather be alone than to talk to people. But why do I feel like this? I don't want to be by myself but sometimes I can't help but to only have myself as company.

There are times I know the other person just doesn't want to talk to me because I bring up generic topics to talk about (how are you doing? Any plans for today? What are you up to now?). But I don't know how to talk... I've been like this for years now. 

I don't want to stay alone because I end up overthinking everything and think the world hates me. Why the fuck am I like this? I need help!"
I planned a get together to see my friends one last time and no one came,"I didn’t tell them why I wanted to hang out and I planned it a while ago so it wasn’t last minute. Everyone flaked. I try not to be a downer when they’re around. I honestly don’t think anyone knows how depressed I’ve been these past few months and I don’t know how to tell anyone. I had a therapist who I’d get all this stuff out to but she left so I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about how hopeless and useless I’ve felt in almost 7 months. I don’t feel like it’s fair to dump it all on my friends and even if I felt I could go to them I don’t know how to tell them.
I’ve planned to jump from a bridge on Monday January 21st. It’ll been cold enough that if I manage to survive the fall I’ll freeze to death in the river. Tomorrow I’m gonna watch the lunar eclipse alone. I’ve always liked stargazing.
Sorry, I have no one to talk to so I’m just shouting into the internet void again. If you’re reading, thank you for giving me a couple minutes of your time 

EDIT: I’m sorry if I’m not responding to some people. I really appreciate your support and I’m trying to but for some reason I get a notification of a comment but it doesn’t appear in the tread. I’m really sorry I promise I’m not trying to be ungrateful or anything 

EDIT 2: I really appreciate the support from all of you. I didn’t think this would get so many responses and I’m really sorry if I don’t respond to some because it’s a tad overwhelming. I did read every one and I just want thank you guys for listening to me for a minute. "
Tired,Anyone else just feel extremely tired all the time? Like not wanting to do anything but stay in bed or waste time doing something meaningless?
Ever wake up every morning and you want to die?,"My depression as constantly began to get worse and worse. It’s been years since my last suicide attempt and I was supposed to try again this year. But then I got a girlfriend, she loves for me cares for me and makes me feel great when we are together. But, even thought we live together I hardly get to see her because she works days and I work graveyard, so when I get home she has to leave. I see here a total of maybe 10 hours a work week. And all those hours I’m away I feel like nothing has changed since before I met her. I go into such deep depressions that I feel like my heart could stop at any moment (wouldn’t be opposed to it anyway). I’m scared to die, but I’m not scared of being dead. The only time I’m happy without her is if I smoke and that last a couple hours tops. I don’t know why I’m so sad. Plenty of people have it way worse then me and somehow they are happy without effort. I have it made, good job, love of my life, a place to lay me head at the end of the night. Sadness overwhelms me almost daily, I’ve tried everything I can. I wake up ever morning and wish I hadn’t. Living seems like an endless battle that I can’t win.  Everyone thinks I’m joking when I tell them I want to die, but honestly that’s the most truthful thing to ever leave my mouth. Anyone else have the same problem?"
I think I have decided to do it.,"I have thought about suicide constantly for many years. My entire life, I have felt as though I have been genuinely cursed. Truly terrible things seem to happen to me with unusual frequency and I can't help but see that this is not how life is supposed to be. I can't even talk about my biggest problems, but a combination of mental illness, constant weight issues, being an outcast from society and seeing no hope for the future all contribute to these feelings.  I have tried holding out, I have tried soldiering on and I have done it for many years, but I live in a constant state of fear and suffering. My sister, who is probably the person I love most in the world, is one of the few reasons I have held on, because I felt that taking my life would hurt her. And I still believe that it would. But I have been thinking about how we are getting older, and it is not fair for me to rely on her as we become adults. She deserves to go have a good life as someone as truly beautiful and kind as she is deserves and if she is constantly hanging out with me, how can she ever have that? Honestly, I can't fight this anymore. I have seen therapists and taken antidepressants, but the only thing that helps me at all is abusing my anti anxiety medicine so I can sleep. I just really can't take it anymore and have stopped thinking about IF I should do it and more about how I should do it in a way that would least inconvenience the people I love the most. I'm thinking about going into the woods and just lying down and freezing to death or jumping in front of a train. I don't know why I am posting this, but I just needed to get this off my chest before I do it. Thank you for your time and I genuinely pray you all have lives better than mine."
1 hour to go,"I've already made up my mind, nobody can talk me out of it so don't even bother with 'dont do it', please
I always wanted to feed ducks, never did. I'm partially housebound thanks to agoraphobia and if the ducks touch me I'd have a panic attacks thanks to OCD, so I have never fed ducks.

This is just one of the things I never did with my life, I've wasted it and spent the first 6 years being happy then the rest feeling unhappy wishing I relived those years. 

I don't have a gun so my death will be painful as hell but its my only method

EDIT: I did it, but my instincts are running wild telling me to tell my parents, what do I say to them

EDIT 2: It failed, I'm in the hospital but I won't be admitted to the ward because of my agoraphobia, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

UPDATE
I tried to reply to you all while in the emergency room but I had no service, here's a bit of information on what happened.
I had a champagne flute full of disinfectant, however I fucked up. Turns out I was too confident that cleaning chemicals are always toxic, turns out the disinfectant was citric acid based.
I tried to kill myself with citric acid.
I didn't even read the back, I'm so fucking stupid. Ny organs aren't even partially affected.
I was not admitted to the psych ward, but I nearly was. My psychiatrist understood that due to my agoraphobia it would not help to admit me, so he vouched for my discharge, which I was discharged 12 hours after I went to the hospital

I had an ECG to check my heart, where I had to take off my shirt, my dad saw my self harm scars. (My mum already knew about it but my dad didn't, he has not mentioned it yet.)"
I’m 15 and honestly just have no will to live anymore,"It’s like... one good thing happens and then a million shitty things happen and I can’t seem to get one moment where I am ever truly happy. Then I’m constantly anxious and paranoid, plus I’ve been hallucinating. 
What’s the point? The only reason I’ve stayed here past 12 years old is because of my sister and now she’s a little brat who hates me because all I do is stay in bed. My parents don’t say it but I know they are disappointed and wish I was a better child. 
All I have is my girlfriend who I can’t even say is my gf because her fucking ex might swoop her off her feet again before I get the chance to even kiss her for the first time. 
I can’t open up to anyone close to me because to me it’s not opening up it’s just dumping all my problems on them. 
I just wish I didn’t fucking exist, that people didn’t care about me and that I could die, or start self-harming in peace again. I mean I did relapse but I can’t even relapse on my wrist so I doesn’t hurt as bad I have to cut on my thighs. 
I just want it to be over. All of it. My depression, my anxiety, my fucking undiagnosed shit, my family problems, I wish that my ex had never molested me. I just want it to be over and I can’t talk to anyone but internet strangers about it. I’m pathetic."
After 20 years of life no one knows me well enough to give me a eulogy,"You ever sit around just picturing your funeral? Hell I don’t even want a funeral. No one cared enough to get to know me when I was alive and they surely won’t care when I’m dead. I wish that could actually be arranged. To just get thrown into the ground without a word being said. Cause that’s how I lived my life, no one wanted me around alive and I don’t want them around when I’m dying."
I just wish I'd get cancer or some incurable illness,"Life just isn't worth living. When you've got the unfortunate mix of being unattractive, irratible, and dumb you realize how shitty the world is. I really want to kill myself but I love some people and would feel awful if my suicide effected them, even if it only affects them for a year at most. I just wish I'd get cancer and die so people could say it was bad luck instead.

I don't know. Maybe I should start smoking cigarettes or something. I wonder how many I'll have to smoke to get the desired results"
My name is John,"I don't know what I'm looking for here. I just want to be heard. I'm posting this on my actual account because I want people to know who I am.

Every day I wake up to a physical pain in my chest. It's the kind of pain that can't be rid of through Aspirin or ibuprofen or Tylenol, it's much like hunger, except it can't be satiated. Every day I wake up and feel it. But I go to class; I do homework; I smile; I laugh; all because that's what people are supposed to do. I'm supposed to get dressed and walk out of my apartment every day prepared to take on the world. But I can't. I'm tired. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of being alone. 

Every day I cry. Most of the time it's when my roommate is gone, but sometimes I don't have that luxury. I work at my school's library, and the other day I was assigned to sort books. While I was working, I lost it. I had to sit in the bathroom for 10 minutes and try to collect myself. When I finally left, I stared at the same title for 30 minutes, all while contemplating walking out of my shift and ending it.

I just don't know what to do. I've never had a girlfriend, and I was a virgin up until 21 til I finally had enough and paid a prostitute. It was shit. I couldn't perform because I was drunk, and she was obviously just in it for the money. No passion whatsoever. All through high school I watched my friends get in relationships. I listened to them talk about relationships and hung out with them and their girlfriends. I enjoyed their company, I considered them friends, but every day something inside of me collapsed a little.

Then, finally, at 22 I met a girl through Tinder. I really really REALLY enjoyed talking to her. We talked for like two weeks before we met up, and it was the first time I've been happy in years. Every day I was checking my phone multiple times a minute. Some people say that a relationship won't fill the hole inside of you, but after that night I can say with certainty that it is exactly what is missing in my life. I want someone to want me and enjoy my company. 

When we met up, I thought things went well. We hooked up. The sex was good - really fucking good - but what made me the happiest was the fact that someone liked me enough to do it with me. But a day later she messaged me and told me that she found me too awkward to talk to and that we shouldn't talk to each other any more. Now, this was a woman who has slept with nine other guys, some of whom were one night stands, and kept in touch with *every* other one of them. This was a woman who dated a man who could only eat pizza, burgers, and french fries, because he had such a bad case of anxiety that any other foods would cause him to break down.

But *I* was too awkward to keep in touch with. *I* was too much work. 

And that broke me. Whatever it was inside of me that had been giving all my life finally collapsed. For years, I've tried to socialize. I've tried clubs, I've tried jobs, I've tried talking to people around me in classes, and it hasn't done anything. I thought maybe it was because I wasn't physically attractive, but then I got in shape and it changed nothing. So I gained a little weight back, and then I met her. I had a chance with a girl. I thought she liked talking to me as I liked talking to her. But I was wrong.

Through her I discovered the truth; I'm fundamentally flawed. I can't socialize. I'm not attractive. There is *nothing* physically impressive about me. I have no hobbies. I'm boring as shit. I'm awkward. I have no redeeming qualities *at all*. I don't know what to do about it either. I tried a number of hobbies. Skateboarding, puzzles, reading, television, exercise, drawing, instruments, etc. It all bored the shit out of me. I had *zero* fun. 

I lie to everyone. I tell people I got laid in high school. I tell them I had a good size friend group. The truth is, I've never had more than a couple friends at a time, and I've never been in a relationship. Every day this eats me up. Every day I wake up, I'm disappointed that I didn't fucking die in my sleep."
After a week long disappearance and a gun purchase I finally admitted myself into the psych ward.,And for the first time in over a decade I am getting the help I have needed. It's never too late.
In few hours it’s over,"Shortly after midnight (between 2:00-3:00) I’m going to hang myself. I refused to live a hopeless, pathetic and miserable life anymore. I’ve written a very short note to my mother. I’m terrified but I must do it.

Fuck you cruel world!

Edit: thank you for the positive comments but I’m domed. Believe me I badly want to live and in the past 4 years I did everything I could to feel better but I don’t belong in this world. Where I’m it’s 23:00 so I’ve 3-4 hours left. Only reason I will wait for few hours is so I can do it when everyone is asleep. I don’t want to be interrupted."
The only thing keeping me from killing myself is my wife and daughter. I am beginning to resent them for it.,"I've talked to two therapist. They both encourage me to get a divorce (after a LOT of therapy). The issue is, I really think I can't handle the stress of a divorce. 

I love my daughter very much, and I want to see her grow up. However, I feel like a fucking robot that can't make anyone happy. I work harder and people ask for more of me.

Both my parents have died in the past year and my last words to both were ""fuck you"" (one deservedly, one not so much). I came from very humble beginnings and worked myself into management and after my dad died my work went to shit and I am getting canned. 

I just don't want to do any of this anymore, but I do becauee I have to. Not sure what I need or if I need anything from here, but it feels better to type it. 8 times I have had serious thoughts about suicide this year, everytime I think of my daughter and realize I can't.

The only thingnthatbreally help is smoking shittons of weed which, of course, leaves my wife dissappointed in me (I have been approved by a physician and live in an legal state. 

My younger brother is in jail and the whole system isndesigned tontake money from families and with me losing my job, it is expenaive to even talk to him.

Our world is cruel and I don't want to live in it.

I spent 10 years in the Army and did 3 tours in a Combat Arms job. I've earned real medals (bronze star with a V, ARCOM with a V) for actions in combat. No one gives a shit. No one cutsbyou any slack for killing for college money. For digging up IEDs for a poverty wage. For losing friends. 

And all I am is a disposable piece in this machine, school, work, the government, family. It's all just people in a line waiting for their piece of me.All this world and the people in it want is to take. I have nothing left to give. I am dead inside. 

I'll wake up and do it again tomorrow. I will wake up, get the babybready while my wife takes a shower. Drop off the baby. And gontrain my replacement and apply for jobs that will reject my resume. I'll home and work on my MBA homework so I can go hate my life for hopefully more money down the road. Fuck this all."
My dad hanged himself today,"I'm in bed now and I just need to write down my thoughts. He was a difficult man, in the sense that his upbringing didn't allow him to believe that he was worthy of love if he wasn't succesful. I just found out that for the past year he'd been covering up the fact that his second company (he lost the first one, worth millions, during the housing crisis) was failing. He'd been getting in with some bad people to stay afloat apparently and he was getting in debt with them too. He just took his life, leaving only a note saying he had a lot of debt and he couldn't deal with it anymore. Not so much as a 'I love all of you'.

My mother is devastated. Me and my sister are just trying to be there for her...

But to be honest. I've also been struggling with depression my entire life. Me and my dad were very much alike and related so much on that level. I thought he was the strongest person I knew. He was literally my hero.

And now I'm just wondering what this all means. How could he have done this? My mom is feeling guilty about being angry but... we are all literally heading for immanent financial ruin. We will lose everything. He was the breadwinner.

I just wish he would have talked to us. I miss him so much already. He was my best friend. Where do I go from here..."
Planned to kill myself today,"January and February was the darkest time in my life and I decided that 18 April would be the most suitable day to end my life. Just like the stupid human I am, I made reminders on my calendar to remind me that it's time. The second reminder was to make an appointment with a psychiatrist for my family. Everything was sorted. 
But when the day came, I don't even remember what I had planned until I saw the reminder. 
Life gets better, it will go downhill too but only to rise again. This gave me hope to continue. Maybe I'll be stronger the next time a wave of sadness hits me."
My life is just a never ending cycle of bullshit,I'm so fucking sick of it. Same shit different day. Change never comes no matter how hard I try. Really considering just ending it all since there is no way out.
My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago.,"My cousin was killed by his girlfriend about a year ago. They were having a fight; she was angry and vindictive like always, they were screaming and arguing at each other. He was fed up with her shit and finally decided to leave her. She called the cops. He got in his car to leave. ""He's got a gun"" she screams. My cousin puts his hands up. Cops think he's raising a gun and they shoot him 14 times. My cousin is left in a semi comatose state. Over the next couple of weeks the hospital sends us updates of his condition; they claim he's improving rapidly and regaining neural and motor functions. It was all lies, He died in the hospital one week later. The Cops claim he was standing when he pointed a gun at them and they acted in self defense. More lies. The ballistics show that he was sitting in the car when he was shot.  For the longest time I never accepted that he was dead, It just never seemed real to me and For the longest time I have been suppressing my emotions but recently this horrible feeling of dread has been seeping over me. The thought of death or dying sends me into a state of intense anxiety complete with Panic attacks. I cant take this anymore; every time it happens I just think over and over again ""Why me""  ""Why did things have to be like this"" ""I wish i never even had these thoughts"" I don't want to feel like this anymore. This is no way to live I shouldn't have to feel like this every day. I want to Die. But i cant. It would cause my family too much grief and they would never understand why i did it. The Last thing I want to do is to spread grief to my family. I wish I had never of been born so I would never have to experience these feelings.
(I apologize for this rambling wall of text, I am an awful writer)"
I tried hanging myself but feel happier,"i tried hanging myself a couple hours ago. i had planned it all day. i even asked for help for the first time ever. but still up until the hanging i felt hopeless. 
it didn’t work because i hung it too low and i was able to push myself out before i could breath my last breath. 
i took down the rope, got into bed, finished homework due today i guess and here i am. 
i feel happy though. not happy to be alive but just happy that a part of me is still fighting to live. i’m not sure how long this feeling will last but i do still intend on getting help because i’m worried that one day, when i’m not ready for it, i’ll just give up. 
i’m not sure where to go from here or how to hide the burning red mark across my neck but i do know i’m the happiest i’ve been in a while."
I can't wake up at 8am and work until 6pm every day until I'm 70. I just can't.,I wasn't made for this society. I'm too weak. I can't keep doing this forever. I feel so drained.
I think people who die are lucky,"they don’t have to suffer every fucking day, they don’t have to be reminded of how worthless they are. they are at peace.

I wish I could be at peace. I’m completely worthless. I deserve to die. I really do. I have notjing to offer all I do is suffer and make others suffer and I wish I was dead I can’t take it anymore

please make it stop"
My friend (15F) is going to kill herself in less than a month.,"This is a call for help.

I met her at the start of 2019, where she was a transfer who was introduced to our school. She was a very social person and easily became friends with other people, so she had no problem fitting in. Since we had similar classes, she and I got closer and started hanging out together around the middle of the year.

Things seemed normal at the start, but she seemed to always stress very easily and it was clear she wasn’t sleeping well. She often slept at school, and started skipping classes. At first, nobody really assumed anything because she laughed it off and seemed to be pretty happy. Some time passes, and she’s getting visibly worse - crying more frequently, eyebags getting darker, less energy etc.

One day, I noticed cuts on her arm, around late October.  I immediately confronted her about it, and she opened up because we were quite close at that point, but wouldn’t really tell me why she was self harming. Over the weeks, when we had exams/finals, she got much worse - she started cutting much more frequently, on her arms, legs, chest etc. Skipping classes one day, she was caught and sent to the Vice Principals office where she told him about her self harming as an excuse (mistake). After getting sent to the counsellors office, her mum was called to school to pick her up.

On the way home, her mother verbally abused her and talked her down for self harming. She was also referred to a psychiatrist (that she didn’t go to) because her parents never bothered to get her to one - not treating the issue seriously enough being one reason, and the price being another (despite spending thousands a year on tutoring).

When she was younger (around 9 or 10), she was abused by her brother who had anger management issues. He would let out his anger onto her by both physically and emotionally abusing her. Her parents never cared enough to notice, which caused her to suffer for years with this kind of treatment. Even years later, she’s still afraid of her brother, and only talks with him when absolutely necessary.

After her mother found out about her self harming, she became increasingly stressed from having to hide her cuts and box cutters, as well as have to deal with her constant forceful attempts at cornering her into telling her about her self harming. There was no place to escape to either, as she shared a room with her mother and hid in the bathroom to self harm. An incident happened just two weeks ago: her father, mother and older brother had left the house earlier in the day which left her alone to roam and relax freely. When she felt a little hungry, she left her room to get food and was ambushed by her mother who was waiting hidden in another room, thinking she had caught her self harming. This was later followed by her father breaking down the door when she made a makeshift lock. (the lock was the barrel bolt type, and the bolt had been removed). She was forced to wait until either her brother or father came home, so she was sure she was safer. Her mother has been really invasive with her privacy and often did this, as well as going through her belongings whenever she isn’t at home.

She has expressed intentions of suicide multiple times throughout the past month, and I think that she is 100% serious and able to follow through.

Right now, only one other friend and I know most of the story and her intentions, and we don’t know what to do. So far, we have been trying our best through talking to her, getting her to open up more and listening to her when she needs it.

We came to reddit to ask older, more experienced people for advice:

* What are the things we should be doing? and how? The adults around us are untrustworthy and she won’t open up to her therapist. (and it’s very unlikely that she would ever)
* What should we say to her to change her perspective on things maybe?
* Since we already know that she’s going to (most likely) commit suicide, what can we do to help prevent it?

Sorry this is a bit of a long read, but this is a basic summary of what my friend and I know. As far as we know, there isn’t anything else to tell. Feel free to ask anything to clarify and I will do my best to answer with what I know.

&#x200B;

 

**Edit**

Thank you so much for all the advice and responses. My friend and I have talked it through and, I called the suicide hotline. After explaining the situation, the person told me that the best and most I could probably do is to keep supporting and being there for her. If it really comes down to it, we are prepared to call the police.

To clarify some things:

Whether we want to or not, it’s not likely we can get in contact with school anytime soon given that school starts at the end of the month and there’s three weeks to the end of the holidays. As far as I know, all the adults around me would rather I stay away rather than help which is why I asked for their help. All of our parents are quite strict as well, she’d gotten away with sleeping over at a friends place twice after running away, then calling after to tell them where she was. And when she got home, she was yelled at for a long time.

I’ve been trying to take her out as much as possible this holiday, and continue to make plans with her, keeping in mind all the advice you’ve given us. I might post again in the future, hopefully for the recovery and healing of her mental health. Thank you so much for all the support you’ve given me, and I hope this turns out well for everyone."
Reddit was the best and worst thing I have discovered,"It all started with studying for the SAT, I created a reddit account to join r/sat to get extra resources and help. 

But then I discovered other communities of reddit...until I dawned upon r/suicidewatch. I spend hours on this sub. I’m so entranced by the resilience of others and what they have overcame thus far. But more selfishly I’m addicted to being heard. I’m addicted to voicing my sadness, my anger, my guilt etc. I love how ppl response and I love how ppl care. I crave this feeling real life but I know this fantasy will never be realized. 

However, this has proved catastrophic for me. I spend so much time on this sub and neglect all my other responsibilities."
"I did it.... (Trigger Warning: Suicidal Ideation, Suicidal Gestures, Hospitalization)","TLDR at End

I have been passively suicidal for some time. Lately, it had become more active; I was making suicidal gestures nightly as a coping skill to deal with my depression, anxiety, and burnout due to the amount of stress I was under. 

Last Monday night, I took it a step further and tried to end my life by strangulation. I obviously failed, but I felt strange... unfulfilled? I didn’t sleep that night; I just cried. 

Tuesday I went into work and we were testing the fire alarms while I was training new employees. I just got this sudden, overpowering urge to kill myself because of the stress and noise and my disappointment in myself for the previous night’s failure. I also got a snap of lucidity. I blurted out to my office manager “I need to go to the hospital” and left work. 

When I got to the ER, and was standing at the front desk, the triage nurse asked me what brought me in. I looked at her and just said “I am having a mental breakdown” and started sobbing uncontrollably. They immediately brought me back to the safe observation room, had me do a urine screen and drew some of my dehydrated blood. They had me strip and put me in safety clothes (paper patient scrubs) and the ER doc came and interviewed me first. 

The ER doc decided I needed a psych evaluation, which lead to a psych nurse basically asking me questions about what was going on. At some point she asked my observer to get me some tissues, and I just started laughing. Uncontrollably. The nurse looked troubled by this. She asked if that was normal for me and I said yes, especially when I was really stressed and anxious. 

She started to explain that the hospital had two programs for psych emergency treatment; full or partial hospitalization. It was her job to advise the doctor on which treatment I should receive. She told me that she decided they were going to place me in full hospitalization. I asked if I had a choice in this matter and she just said “No, as of this moment we have a court order for your involuntary admission to the psych unit on a 72 hour hold. We are just waiting for the unit transfer to go through.”

I just kind of chuckled and said “that’s fair.”

The three days went by slowly. No tech, no outside contact. Just treatment groups (I painted a recipe box, drew a picture of a tree, learnt about the anger cycle and learnt waaaay too much about myself), mealtimes (we got a choice of what we wanted, within reason... and no sharp edges), and meeting with doctors, social workers and your assigned nurse. 

At the end of my involuntary hold, they asked if I was ready to be discharged from inpatient, and I said yes. 4 hours later I was released to the world, but not fully from the hospital. I was placed in partial hospitalization: weekdays I have to check into the program at 7:30, and get out at 3. They are further refining my meds as well as having me attend group therapy and occupational therapies and such. I have my first full day of PHP on Monday. 

I always avoided seeking help. When I went to the hospital, I had truly given up. They were nothing but nice to me, and being cared for gave me hope for the future. 

If you feel suicidal or self harmful, it can be hard and scary to go to the hospital. The cost can seem prohibitive. The social stigma can be repulsive. Admitting you need help can seem impossible. 

I’m not paying for my hospitalization or PHP; the hospital has a grant program if your earned income is below a certain threshold. No one knows why you are there (or if you even are there) unless you tell them or give the staff permission. And if you are on this board... you have already admitted you need help. 

I have learnt a lot the past several days. I entered with an open heart and nothing to loose, and grew because of it. Please, consider going to the hospital. 

TLDR: Tried suicide for the hundredth time, had mental breakdown, admitted myself to the hospital, got better."
My mom mocked my suicidal tendencies before running off to the bar,Help. Mother’s Day and such
I WANNA FUCKING DIE.,Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
I tried to hang myself tonight,"Self-explanatory.  The rope wasn't long enough, I couldn't make a secure knot over the light fixture. I kicked the chair, felt the pull on my neck and it immediately came loose and I fell on my back. Got right back up and tried again, same thing. I can't do anything right. I wish it had worked. I'm so tired. I'm tired of myself. I'm tired of my shitty artistic projects that go nowhere and don't amount to anything. I'm tired of my job. I'm tired of school. I'm tired of everyone treating me like I'm not a human being or I'm invisible. I'm tired of the citizens bank atm that never works. I'm tired of feeling like a disappointment to everyone.  I'm tired of all of the thoughts I can't stop and the emotional trauma I'm going through. It just keeps getting worse and worse and I just want it to end.  The person I love the most continuously treats me like nothing.  I tried to stop drinking and cutting and everything's just gotten worse.  Things keep setting me off and I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I'm going to buy a longer length of rope tomorrow.  I feel like everyone would be better off if I was dead and everyone would love me more. Everyone loves someone more when they're dead and I don't feel like anyone does now and its all I want.  I know everyone will move on and be fine and I'm tired of being a disappointment and a burden.   I can't even talk about what's driving me the most with anyone because it makes me feel ashamed and humiliated. Its never going to stop. God I just wish it had worked tonight. I'm very drunk, I'm sorry."
Fuck everything I'm done,"**edit** I have everything I need. Tonight is it. Just wrapping up some stuff. 

 had enough of people not giving a shit about me. 

I'm done with being lonely

I can't continue existing without friends, without love, with narcissistic parents.

I can't face court all by myself to try and put my rapist in prison. He assaulted at least 10 women, but none of them will lift to finger to help me. 

I'm tired of people treating my brother's memory with love and sadness when he molested me as a child and abused mentally for the rest of his life

I never thought I would die alone with nobody giving a shit about me, but I guess I didn't count on a lot of things"
Going to leave my suicide letter here,"I only have ever wanted to feel love.  I’ve always wanted to be loved.  But I struggle to feel connected to people, I struggle to believe that anyone in my life loves me.  I’m deeply convinced that nobody does.  

If there’s anything that I’ve learned in life, it’s that people can really fucking leave you.  And I could never understand why.  But “love” has always been conditional - be good, behave, don’t let your sadness show - and only then you’ll be loved.  It’s my fault people leave.  I always do something to mess it up.  Because I’ve never understood how to relate to others.  

People have told me I’m too difficult to love.  People have left me after seeing how sad and anxious I really get.  I’ve been told my entire life that my body is not okay and not worthy of being seen.  

I’ll never forget the therapist that ruined my life forever.  He diagnosed me, looked me right in the eyes, and told me I’d never have normal relationships ever again.  My life felt like it ended that day.  I was fifteen.  I’ve never been the same since.  Since then, I’ve felt like I was born wrong.  My entire existence was a mistake.  I was inherently beyond repair.  Nobody would ever love me again.  

Rejection.  Over and over again.  

I’m not worth being loved.  I’m not worth anyone’s time.  I don’t deserve safety or comfort.  

I feel empty.  I can’t see any life in my own eyes anymore.

I’ve hung on as long as I could in the hopes that someone would just stay with me.  I’ve bargained with myself, I’ve said well, if no one can love me, I’ll let someone abuse me if it meant they just stayed in my life.

And now, I’m almost 29, and I am truly alone.  I have no one I can talk to.  No one that knows just how dark it really gets sometimes.  I feel connected to no one.  I don’t feel safe around anyone.  Friendships feel superficial.  Dating and relationships are far too difficult.  Sex doesn’t feel good.  Companionship seems impossible.  

I don’t have anyone.

Maybe there are some people in the world that are just kind of meant to be discarded and forgotten about.  Maybe I’m one of those people, even though I’ve tried to make something of myself.

I just wanted to be loved.  That’s all.  I just wanted to know what love feels like so bad.

My therapist was really my last hope that maybe someone could stay in my life.  That maybe someone liked me.  I haven’t been able to cope without her.  Now that she’s out of my life, I truly am alone.  I don’t have anyone I feel like I can depend on anymore.  No one that supports me.  No one I can talk to.

Honestly, in my wildest fantasies, I just wanted someone to hold me and tell me they love me.  Tell me I’m a good kid.  That I’m doing a good job.  That I’m a sweet boy.  That I’m lovable.  That they will stay with me.  That I’m good enough.  That my body is okay and nothing is wrong with it.  That I don’t need to work so hard to get people to like me.  I wish someone could just look at me and tell me I’m okay exactly as I am.   

Being good enough is really one of my wildest dreams.  As long as I can remember, I’ve never been good enough and I always put in so much effort to make up for it in other ways.  But it’s exhausting now.  I’m tired. 

I don’t want to do this, but I know I have to.  After my body is found and I’m confirmed dead, I’d like to be cremated.  All of my belongings can be discarded.  My cats can go to loving homes - I’m hoping maybe people I know.  My social media can be taken down.  I imagine work and life will go on as normal.  

If my body is found and I’m not dead - I do not want to be on life support, I do not want to be resuscitated, I don’t want to be in any kind of vegetative state.  I do not want any type of end of life care.  I want to be euthanized as quickly as possible.  Under no circumstances do I want to be kept alive.  

I’m sorry.  I just wanted to know what love felt like."
Stuck in the house with my rapist.,"As title says. Lockdown has me stuck 24/7 in the same house as my brother, who raped me over the course of 3 years when I was a kid. Usually I have work, friends, boyfriend, places to go, things to do that keep me away from here as least some of the time. But all I hear when I wake up and when I go to sleep is his laughter, laughter that should have been mine. He's disabled, so everyone ignores what he did, as if it somehow means it doesn't hurt me because ""he wasn't *trying* to hurt you."" But he DID. I look back at my life and wonder just how much he took from me and how much more he will continue to take. What's the point in continuing on if I'm just going to lose so much before it even has a chance to happen? I'll never marry, because I'll never be able to find someone willing and able to suffer through my mood swings, my depression, my complete lack of emotional control. I'm already 99% sure my bf is readying himself to end it. I'll never achieve my dreams because I lack the drive to do anything constructive for myself. I'll keep pushing people away because I'm so afraid they'll hurt me. What's the point in living in a world where people want you so little, they'll defend and protect your rapist? All I ever wanted was someone to come along who would be angry for me. Who would show me that this was not what I deserved and introduce me to peace and maybe justice. But all anyone has ever done is pull a curtain over it and tell me not to look. But it's there, it's always there and it always will be. People always tell us assault victims that we're ""survivors"" but I don't want to ""survive"". I want to live. But I don't think I ever will."
Does anyone else on this sub feel like there’s an invisible anchor dragging you down? At this point I’m sick of fighting it and I just want to drown,"One minute I’ll be walking down the street. Everything’s fine, I love walking, don’t you know endorphins are supposed to be the body’s natural heroin, and then suddenly I feel myself slowing down.

My footsteps become heavier to the point I’m trudging on the sidewalk and I feel like I’m a thousand pounds.

It gets to the point where my feet are made of lead and I can’t even walk anymore. I can’t even stay still, I just want to lay on the concrete and let people step on me, whatever. 

It’s like there’s this anchor and it’s dragging me down and I just want to slip under because all my life I’ve been falling and I’ve finally gotten to the place where I can’t climb back out. 

Everything requires a monumental effort, except for my suicidal thoughts which pop into my head like spam emails. I just want it to stop. And suicide feels like my only way out.

I just want to feel lighter. "
It is my birthday today and it is a huge milestone for me. :),"About a month ago, I was sure I was going to die by suicide pretty soon, and I was sad that I wouldn't make it until my birthday. But here I am right now, I am really proud of myself for making it this far and my depression is finally starting to pass. Thank you all."
Anybody else ever feel like you've probably got a few conditions that are un-diagnosed?,Sometimes I wonder how many mental illnesses I'd get a diagnosis for if I actually had the energy or time to go to a psychiatrist.
Update,"I posted here recently about being homeless and sleeping under a bridge in Canada. Due to everyone's help and kind words, I'm in a shelter now hoping to get back on my feet in an actual home asap. Thank you very much to everyone who helped me this far! Bit nervous so pray everything goes smoothly"
Does anyone else just feel like you’ve lived enough?,"Im out of my severely depressed phase but I have no motivation to do anything. No job, no friends nearby....i feel like I’ve lived enough."
You ever get that 'why bother' mentality?,"I dont enjoy life. I'm untalented, lonely, failing all of my classes, and am an emotional wreck. Each day is just going through the motions. It's not like I actually enjoy anything, havent been happy in years. Seeing all my friends succeed and excel in the same things I'm struggling to do on a fundamental level just kinda sucks. Being alive has no redeeming qualities. If you're reading a book or watching a movie you dont like, you stop. Why should life be any different? 

Why bother being alive"
I participated in a suicide prevention walk yesterday and it made me feel more suicidal,"I hoped that participating in this walk would give me hope, and help me see how much suicide impacts the lives of the people left behind. Instead, I felt miserable. Everyone was writing messages for people they've lost to suicide and hanging them up for everyone to see. I feel so incredibly screwed up saying this, but as I read the messages, I was envious of the people they wrote about. I was jealous they had the guts to go through with it because I know I don't. This is my first time saying this out loud, because I am so fearful of being judged, but it feels good to get it off my chest."
I wish I could trade places with kids that are actually abused.,"Because, then, I’d actually have a real excuse as to why I’m like this. I wish my family didn’t love me. I wish they’d beat me. I wish I was raped. I wish I could take the place of every actually abused kid, because they don’t deserve to be hurt. 

My mom is so loving it makes me feel terrible. When she gets me donuts in the morning. When she brings me breakfast and I don’t do shit for her. My grandfather, whom I live with, is working his ass off most nights, and yet I can’t even be bothered to pick up the trash I leave around the house, or go outside to help him with groceries. 

Maybe it’s my mental illness talking, but I genuinely hate how I am. How everything I do is selfish and how uncaring and unhelpful I am. 

A few months ago, I was practically begging my mom to take her anger out on me, to beat me, because I wanted an excuse to be depressed. I wanted to be traumatized, like she was from her own past. 

They buy me so many electronics I shouldn’t even have. I’ve dropped out of school, and when I was in school I’d missed so many days a school councelor visited my home. I’d ran away so many times, worrying them until their worry turned to anger. 

They’ve given me everything, and yet I’m so ungrateful."
Passive Suicidal Ideation,"I have passive suicidal thoughts at least semi regularly. The best way I can describe it is like standing in front of a firing squad waiting and wanting them to pull the trigger but they never do. I don't know if anyone else can relate to that description.

EDIT: Wow, I wasn't expecting so many replies. Not that I thought I was alone in thinking this way but it's comforting to know there's people in similar situations. I'll be 40 next year and I've been living with this and Borderline Personality Disorder since my teenage years. I honestly don't know how I'm still here especially since I've engaged in a lot compulsive and impulsive behaviour. But I am still here."
Social anxiety is pushing me to suicide,Everyday is suffering with social anxiety. The only time I feel ok is when I'm at home. Having to suffer 40 hours a week every week makes me question whether life is even worth it.
"Does anyone else have things that happen in their lives that your immediate reaction to is, ""I should kill myself""? Because that's nearly everything to me.",No friends. I should kms. Everyone around me in school hates me. I should kms. Ex-friends around me all the time. Kms. Ex-lovers around me all the time. Kms. Classes are anxiety inducing and terrible. Kms. My past? Kms. My present? Kms. My future? K.M.S.
People only care when they think you're gonna do it,"They talk you out of it, and then they're like 'oh good' and never talk to you again. It's like they're fucking angels of hell or something sent to keep you living and suffering. I feel like I genuinely could be in Hell."
It's So Hard to Find Meaning After Rock Bottom...,"In the last 6 years I lost my mother to a sudden illness (amyloidosis) married the love of my life, found a successful career with a sweet company car, bought a house, succumbed to alcoholism, attempted suicide, lost my father to alcoholic dementia, lost my my wife, car, house and my job.  I was sober for about 8 months but have been struggling for the last 4 months, jobless in a town without anyone but my 97 year old grandmother.  

I've been hiding my relapse from everyone.  

I flipped out on a friend on Facebook and said something that really turned the knife in me.  He spewed off all his accomplishments -- owner of two companies, wife and 4 kids, head of three community boards, two houses and then said, ""And what about you?  Are you even recovered?""

But honestly, what does all those things even mean?  Do they matter?  Do I matter?  Does it really matter to anyone if I recover?  The stigma is so terrible with addiction that the first thing he went for was that.  He was right, but that just reinforces that addicts are the scum of the earth, and I'm one of them.

So is it really worth it?  We're on an over populated planet with people fighting for their piece of the pie.  Do I deserve anything?"
The only thing keeping me alive is the fear that I’ll survive,"I’m afraid that I’ll survive and become physically deformed and mentally handicapped. This is one of the few things that will make my pointless life even worse. Even if I somehow do survive without any of this happening to me, I will be forced to be medicated and forced to go to therapy. Everyone would just see me as a person who attempted suicide and not a normal person for the rest of my life."
"72, Female, Helpless, Useless and Unable to Cope","I am 72.  Last year my husband of 50 years decided to divorce me.  I have total income of $1100.00.  Can't find a residence for less than $850.inclluding utilities.  Don't know how to be poor.  Have debts that are huge.  Have no living family.  Soon won't be eating and don't care to go to the food bank.  Social Services won't help because I have 10K in the bank.  I've had and been treated for depression since I was 15.  The meds work OK normally, but these are not normal times for me.  I can't last much longer.  I struggle each night to not finish it all.  One night it will be too strong an urge.  I look forward to that day."
People don't actually care,"Isn't it funny to see how people always say things like ""I'm here for you"" and all that bullshit when you're gonna commit suicide? But when you're not committing suicide, they don't care. People leave you when you say you feel down, that you need somebody. Yet these same people are the ones that'll go ""I care about you"" when shit goes down.

People lie. Nobody cares about you. We're all worthless, like life itself."
"My camp was destroyed, I'm going to hang myself","I went into the town centre today to hand my CV into as many places as possible, I managed to get a hot meal from a local church before heading home. 

While I was gone (9+hours) someone had broken into my camp and destroyed my tent with everything inside then lit it on fire...

Karma is a bitch. I deserve this.

I can't do this anymore, I don't have the energy to continue.

I take one step forward and it life sends me ten steps back.

I'm done, I'm ready to see my family again, I'll see them soon.

I'm going to use the spare cord from the tent that wasn't destroyed and hand myself.

This is goodbye, Andrew."
Talk about a curveball...,"Today (1/30) at 5:15 PM, my mother suddenly passed away while I was at school. With this happening, I no longer have any parents. As I type this, I'm not as emotional as I thought I'd be. I guess it may be shock? Regardless, my mind is going at a million miles per hour right now... I'm in college and now my mother will never see me graduate from a 4-year college, move out of the house, or any other life achievement. I'm not sure if I can continue... I loved her so much."
I've stopped thinking about suicide,"It started when i was 12, crying in my room alone every night, writing down why i wanted to die and how life was meaningless. I've been in this state of mind during too many years. 

At first i thought being normal would give me hapiness. So i took care of myself, i discovered sex and social activites in highschool, i discoverded frienship and for a time i really thought this was my purpose, that being average was good and that i was happy. I used to be socially akward and never talk to girls, never go out or talk to anyone. I was living in my imagination, escaping reality with virtual worlds where i was free 

And here i am,  21 yo, i just gave up my garbage engineering school . I want more, i want to fight, figthing for girls and being cool was futile, i want to succeed. I m working hard my maths and physics to get a better school next year. I was blind, but now i can finally see the beauty  behind the maths, the meaning of it. 

We are just animals, everything we do is useless. We are nothing, with the body and the mind of an ape. So we need to give everything we can to keep this body in a good state. I was an alcooholic and drug addict, i only lived in false worlds. I'm done now, no more suicidal thoughts, no more bullshit. 

I realized i was addicted to video games, my phone, music, parties, sex and other drugs. This helped me a lot in my evolution, getting away from these things saved me. I hope it will help you too

"""Why don't you get a girlfriend?""","What the fuck.

What the actual fuck.

HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU BE SO FUCKING CASUAL ABOUT THIS?

I've heard this from counselors. I've heard this from therapists. The cocksucking psychiatrist who diagnosed me with PTSD, MDD and BPD (""borderline traits"") told me this.

How the actual fuck can people be so fucking casual about a romantic relationship?

Do y'all mfs just think I can go to Amazon and order one?

I- I don't get it. I don't get it.  I DON'T FUCKING GET IT. WHAT THE FUCK.

LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST GO UP TO A GIRL I LIKE AND SAY ""hey i like u let's date because my psychiatrist said so"" FUCK YOU YOU TRIVIALISING PIECES OF HUMAN TRASH.

fuck you.

fuck you for telling an ugly fat incel to go get a girlfriend like it's no big deal.

fuck you for treating the idea of a girl's love like it means nothing.

and fuck you fuck you fuck you for even trying to tell me that there's any chance in the fucking world that a girl can like anything about me, because i can guaran-fucking-tee you that in the 5 years since i first went on meds, since i first went to therapy, after all the working out and hospitalizations, I've only become worse.

Fuck you for not listening to me and gaslighting me whenever I say I'm unlovable you fucking ""professionals"". 

Fuck you for not taking me seriously when I literally carved the word ""unlovable"" all over my body.

Fuck you for trivialising and reducing love down to nothing.

Because guess what you fucking sorry excuse of a mental health system, some of us don't get love or kindness just because we need it. 

I didn't go to you just because I saw and experienced a lifetime of emotional, mental, physical and sexual abuse. I didn't go to you just because I was and still am constantly bullied for the way I look and act. 

No one will ever fucking love me for any part of what I am or do, and your amazing lack of sympathy and downright intolerance for that fact, the kind of intolerance that lead you to actually get angry at me at even suggesting the idea that girls don't like fat, ugly guys, you fucking ""professional"", it's truly incredible. Leaving meds and help behind didn't make my life better, but it's really amazing how little leaving medical help behind affected me; life was and is getting worse, I was and am and will be unlovable, I should've and need to kill myself as soon as fucking possible


So stop treating girlfriends like it's just another pill you can prescribe. Not only is it not a poor girl's job to ""fix"" me or handle the burden of my bullshit, it's certainly not your right to tell me to find love when I'm SITTING AT YOUR FUCKING DESK BECAUSE LOVE AND KINDNESS WON'T EVER BE A PART OF MY LIFE YOU IGNORANT FUCK I HOPE SOMEONE FORCES YOU TO EAT THE CURB MAY YOUR JAW TURN TO ASHES"
I'm Worthless,"I'm 14M, my dad is a pussy, my mom is abusive and screams at me for ""taking his [my dad's]side"" whenever I try to stop her. At school I barely have friends and those that I do don't really like me they're just trying to be nice.

I am so hopelessly ugly that it's 100% guaranteed I will never have a girlfriend. This Is not a body image issue, it's just a issue of my bad face. And I'm a guy. I'm 5'8"" and not growing anymore too, just to make things worse.

I've never done anything at all with my life, just simpering to my abusive mom who will just take my phone for ever disagreeing with her. I am never happy anymore at all. Just more misery every day.

I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome which means extreme cramping every single day of my life and complete dependence on having a toilet nearby.

My parents forced me into isolation by homeschooling me until this year (9th grade). Which means I have zero social skills. I don't even have the building blocks for social skills. I've never been to a party or even gone to anyone else's house, until this year at 14 I had never even talked to another person under 18. 

I wasn't even allowed to play games as a kid, I was forced to do extreme academic work and do nothing but school and sleep. My parents were both extreme nerds with 130 IQs, neither of who wanted me, my mom just had me to spare her 9 months of endometriosis pain (she admits this is why she had me). 

I just don't care any more, my 15th birthday is Friday which means I can spend it alone in my room like any other day, after a miserable day of final exams on my birthday. Final exams that will result in punishment if I don't get A+, in my family I'm told I'm an idiot who needs tutoring if I get an A not an A+. B's are grounds for punishment. No, I'm not Asian.

I just wish I had someone to be with or something to do, all I do is make people uncomfortable. Some people are nice to me but only out of obligation and kindness, not because they actually like me.

Nothing will change when I get older. I'll still be disgusting and will die a virgin, if I get to be 18 I'll just be an i*cel. 

And even if I get a good job or have any academic success, it's all pointless, nobody likes me and I enjoy absolutely nothing. 

I want to die, a lot. But I'm also afraid that there's no afterlife and it's going to be a black void. That's as much a possibility as heaven or hell. I really don't want to be lonely for all eternity."
how do you even respond to a suicide hotline when they ask “how can i help you”,"i don’t know!!! i don’t know how to answer that!! there’s probably nothing you can personally do to make sure i don’t off myself tonight!!! 

normally if the person picks up and says how can i help you i just hang back up

tonight i tried to call them three times over the span of a few hours and i just don’t even know how to start a conversation 

maybe it’s a sign from god or some shit that i really should just throw myself off the bridge next time"
"I understand suicide now. Trust me, it's not a choice. It's an action.","I was abused last year, and I've paid dearly for it. Pretty much with my life. The same people who didn't understand me when I called for help, blamed it on me. Everything has been taken away from me, including my dignity and personality. People help you but they get tired and then they think you're a liar. 

I just want to say that if you're out there, and you've had suicidal thoughts, I totally understand. I get it now. I believe that those who suicide are too pure for this world. The most beautiful souls don't fit in here. It's always the good ones that suffer.

I'm with you. Just know that I know. I know that feeling. The world thinks it understands, but it doesn't. I'm there with you in this moment, in that feeling you have. In the pain. In the misunderstanding, in the absense of justice. I don't have an answer and I don't have any comforting words, but I'm with you."
I wish there was a reset button for life,I really need one
I haven't been okay for a long time. I'm only alive because I don't know how to die.,"They say you shouldn't bottle up your feelings. They say honesty is the best policy. They're right of course. But that doesn't mean what should be done is the same as what can be done.

I fucked up. Not in a huge way. Not in a way that affects anyone but me in the long term. I'm a lazy asshole. Am I escaping? Am I hiding? And I distracting myself? Doesn't matter. I was supposed to be working. I wasn't. I got reprimanded. And I'm taking it hard despite the fact everyone is having a fantastic fucking day today.

So here I am, in tears because I take criticism and being called out on my bullshit too personally. I don't want to die. Dieing hurts. Dieing hurts people who give a fuck about you for whatever reason. Dieing is complicated. I want to have never existed. Then no one would hurt.

I want to tell people I'm hurt. But it's not their problem. I want to tell people I'm not okay. But who am I to ruin a perfectly good day? People get so upset when you tell them things that suck. I don't want to make anyone upset. So I go through one day where I'm in pain. Then two days. Then a week, a month, two months... I feel like if I just wait and stay quiet, things will get better, like a toothache you ignore until you don't notice it anymore. Why bother a friend when I can just wait? Eventually the pain leaves and no one is hurt by the end.

But this pain isn't ending. I don't think the pain ever ended before either. New pain digs up the old pain. But I'm not about to ruin anyone's day. I'm not about to complain. My problems are mine. Who am I to foist my problems in someone else who's job isn't to deal with my shit?

That's exactly what it is: shit! What good is shit? What good is a person who has nothing but shit? I want to have never existed. Death seems like the next best thing. But I live in a place with no access to it. No tall bridges. No tall buildings. I'd take pills, but that's not a guarantee. I'd shoot myself with my husband's gun, but I don't want him to get in trouble. I'm too squeamish to open my veins. I don't know how to end this. If I did, I would have left earth months ago.

Just because I'm here doesn't mean I'm okay.

Edit: Gold? Really? Thanks!"
"Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it..","Please don't do it. I'm scared I might. Please don't do it. I'm scared I might. 

***please don't do it.***

***IM SCARED I MIGHT***

**PLEASE DON'T DO IT**

**I JUST MIGHT**"
Passive suicidalness,"Does anyone else feel very detached from life? Not like in a ""I want to die"" way but ""I wouldn't mind if I got hit by a car or contracted a terminal illness"". 

I think my perspective comes from years of being depressed and actively suicidal, such that death really doesn't scare me or even really matter to me. It feels like living in an ocean, with no shore in sight - sometimes it peaceful, and the ocean is manageable. But sometimes there's a storm and it's all I can do to keep my head above water. And no matter how good I get at treading water, inevitably the only way to go is down.

I'm tired of treading water, tired of working so hard just to survive, tired of dreading the next storm."
I'm in the queue for a suicide chat and there's 54 people ahead of me,It's kind of depressing that there are so many of us.
Why can’t I just be SHOT ALREADY,JUST FUCKING SHOOT ME ALREADY. I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE GOD FUCKING DAMMIT. WHY CANT THE WORLD JUST GIVE UP ON ME ALREADY AND KILL ME
To my boyfriend,"He's done more for me then he will ever know. I was planning to kill myself after school in early June. I planned it for almost a week. When the day came, I was still low enough to go through with it. I was set on it. However, during last period, he said something. He said he wanted to commit the act of falling on a sword (don't remember the word). He's suicidal as well, as well as most of my friends, so suicide jokes are common. What stopped me was what he said after. He said he would've done it already if it weren't for me. This changed my view instantly, and I didn't do it. It made me feel needed, and not completely worthless. The day after that day was actually a bit better, and it stayed a bit better. I haven't been that low since. It's still hard to deal with, but it's more bearable now. If I had actually done it, I would most likely be dead right now. I could never thank him enough, but I'll never be able to tell him. I love him so much."
i want to die.,i want to just vanish.
Tell me I'm not the only one that do this,"Sometimes I 'play' dead. Let me explain myself before you think I'm nuts. 
I stop breathing on purpose for as long as I can, and I pretend to be found dead. My body relaxes and I tilt my head to one side. My body is limp and unresponsive to any stimulation. Somehow, it calms me down when I'm having a crisis, because it is a dream that I can't make come true. I can't leave my family, since they would never forgive me.
Am I the only one that do this?"
"Does anyone else feel like suicide is the way they're ""meant to go""?","I don't think that's the right way to phrase it but I really don't care about anything right now. 

The way I feel right now, and have for the longest time, is not something I can deal with forever. I don't know when I'll die, this year, next year, whenever, but I'm almost 100% sure that it'll be by my own hand. It feels like it's inevitable."
Nobody knows who I am. Remember me. Please.,"I'm sorry this is so long.

Nobody knows who I am. I haven't had a friend in years. I don't remember what friendship was like. When I talk to people, something always feels off, as if I'm speaking a different language or something. I just want someone to know me. It's so lonely and cold and empty and I just want to scream so loud that I hurt myself.
I was born in Alabama. I was an accident, my dad was and still is a meth addict. My mom is great and has raised me all these years. She left my real dad when his addiction got too bad. I was about 2 or 3, maybe younger. We moved to a new town, she met a new guy. My step dad. He was good at first. We moved to Texas for his new job, he broke. 
Something in his changed. He became abusive. He didn't hit me, and he only hit my mom once, but he was verbally and emotionally abusive. She was with him from when I was in first grade to fifth grade. 
He started storing food and water in his room. Note, his room. My mom slept in my room with me because she hated him. He thought we were going to poison him. 
Both him and my mom became alcoholics during this time, and would drink bottles of wine and then scream at each other all night.
Even though I was going through this, those were the happiest years of my life. Or maybe I'm just looking back with rose tinted glasses. At school I had so many friends and everyone liked me. Everyone though I was funny. 
In fifth grade my depression and anxiety started. I started to realize I was fatter then my friends and it hurt to think about. They started making fun of me for wearing undershirts instead of bras.
 My best friend was a boy named Ben. I loved him and I still do. I think about him a lot. His dad forced him to stop being my friend because it was ""gay"" to be a close friend with a girl. He pushed me away and now he's gone. 
I got chosen to do a speech at my school assembly because everyone liked me. It was for a pep rally. I was supposed to announce the winner of the fundraiser or some shit like that. They changed it at the last second, had some random old guy who donated to the school announce it instead. So they made me go up there with no plan and just wing it. I froze and everyone laughed at me. Or maybe they didn't, I don't know what's real and what's my anxiety imagining things anymore. 
I started lying a lot around this time too. Not to my parents, by to everyone else. I made up elaborate fake lives, I still do. They're nothing special, just, different.
My mom divorced my step dad in fifth grade. I had to keep visiting him for a while. He had completely lost it by then and would probably have killed us both if we hadn't left. One time I was at his house, my old house, and tried to run away because I was scared of him. He caught me and called the police on me. I don't know why. My neighbors were watching and called my mom. They were good people. 
The policeman got there and said I was lying. He told me my mom was putting all the thoughts of abuse in my head. Then, he forced me to hug my step dad while I screamed and cried in fear. That memory is one of the worst ones I have. He left, and I had to stay at my dads house still. 
He blackmailed my mom into giving him everything. The money, the car, the house, my dog. Just out of spite. I miss her. Her name was ginger. She'd probably be around 10 years old right now if she is still alive. I don't know if she is. I miss her even after all this time. We packed everything into a cheap car and moved back to Alabama. I lost everything. 
I started to realize I was different in middle school. I did weird things, I acted weird. I would touch other people's hair becuase I liked the way it looked. I still acted like a very young child even at 11. Don't know why. I didn't have a single friend in 6th grade. 
In 7th grade, I became truly depressed. I did ha e someone though. Her name was Mary. She's gone now too.
In 8th grade, I had a bigger group of friends. Everyone still thought I was weird though. I still did weird things, dressed weird too. I know there's probably something wrong with me but my mom is too scared to take me to a doctor to get diagnosed. She thinks medicine is bad. Pills specifically. That's why I'm not allowed any anti depressants either. 
When highschool started, my social anxiety was so bad that I started homeschooling. The homeschooling laws are so lax in Alabama that I barely did anything except play the sims all day. 
In 10th grade, we became poor. Lost the car, lost everything almost. She got a new job in Ohio, we moved again. I lost all of my friends again.
I homeschooled at first, then started going to the local highschool. I thought everything had changed, that I could be normal. It was hell. Everyone hated me. My favorite memory is when I walked into a room to get something, only to hear ""does she seriously dress like that? Wow."". It hurt. We were still pretty poor and I was doing the best I could. All of my clothes were from goodwill. There was one guy there who was nice to me. His name was evan. I hope he has a good life, he was one of the best people I've ever met.
Luckily I'm kind of smart and got into a program that let me start college early, so for 11th grade that's what I've been doing. It's so lonely. It's so fucking lonely I just want to scream and scream and scream but I can't. I've never know what it's like to be in love with someone who loves you. I've never kissed anyone or even held hands or anything close. I feel so fat and ugly all of the time even when people tell me I'm not. I posted on amiugly and everyone said I was pretty, I thought it would help but it didn't. 
I've become very paranoid. I'm scared all of the time that people are out to get me, that my life is a simulation, that I'm dead. I talk to myself. Either comforting words telling myself it's ok or long spiraling sentences about what a disgusting fat cunt I am. I'm scared.
I told my mom about the depression, and the anxiety. She doesn't know I'm suicidal. That I've been planning out what best way to end it for months. I can't go to therapy. There's a huge scholarship learning abroad program I'm signing up for and they won't let me go if I'm a fucking loon. 
So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The only reason I haven't ended it is because I want someone to remember me, to mourn me, other than my mom. 
I have a sister. I only found out about her when I was 11ish. She's my half sister in my dads side. I don't know how old she is anymore. I was so happy to meet her. It was so good to have a sibling. I felt like I had a real family. She left for college and immediately stopped talking to me. I haven't heard from her in years. The last thing she texted me was a happy birthday text a few years ago. I miss her. She was good. 
Her and my dad won't even know I'm dead. My last birthday was sad. I had been planning out my sweet 16 for years. I didn't have any birthday parties for years because I wanted to have one big one. When it finally came around, I didn't have anybody to invite. It was just me and my mom. I ate some cake, opened my presents, and played video games. Not terrible at all, but not what I had been dreaming of since childhood.
I'm supposed to turn 17 next month. March the 20th. Please remember me. Please if you have the time, read my story. You'll be the only people to know it except for me. I hope you remember me. I just want someone to know me again. It's so cold being alone.

Goodbye
-mimi 


Edit: 
I didn't think people would care this much. The support I have received from all of you is legitimately amazing. So, thank you. I think I'm going to try and get some help, even if I have to put my studies on hold. Im trying to reply to everyone, sorry that it's taking so long.

See you later
-mimi "
I AM REALLY CLOSE TO JUST GIVING UP,"everything around me just seems pointless to me. I am currently in the midst of an exam period and have done around 3 hours of study total for 5 exams. I have no motivation and just sit in silence just fuckin sad. I am not apart of a friend group and just have friends who each have their own friend group and always see photos of them out with their groups without me while I just sit at home. Specifically, there was a time where my mate who I routinely gamed with was going out every Friday and Saturday night thus taking away the limited time both of us were free to play games in. This meant I would get on by myself and just not enjoy it. 

I am just sick of not being included and ""loved"" in a way by my friends and peers and this shit is making me feel so alone and to make things worse I am 16M and still haven't had my first hook up (which may not sound like a big deal for my age) but always hearing about the new girl or guy one of your friends is with just adds to the loneliness. 

Also, the girl who is literally one of my closest mates is PERFECT in my eyes and I have been repeatedly sent to the friend zone and have to live with the ""pain"" knowing how bad I want to be with her and just care for her but she doesn't feel the same :/

Even better is when I only get to see my father twice a year for a total of around two weeks as he lives abroad married to another woman after my mum found him cheating with my now step mum. I won't get to see him until at least 2021 and just am overall struggling.

Sorry for the long paragraph but I am struggling with a lot of things and seriously contemplating ending it all just could never imagine the pain my single mother would feel. That is the only factor keeping me from ENDING IT ALL AHHHHHHHHHHHHH."
Anyone else ever fantasise about their own death and funeral?,"I sometimes find myself fantasising about my own death, like picturing how I'd die, whether it's from suicide or even some tragic accident. I imagine what my funeral would be like, all my friend's and family being upset and devastated about my death. I wonder who would actually be upset and how much they cared about me. It kinda makes me want to do it even more tbh, it makes me feel something that I can't really explain.

I just want to know if anyone else gets this?"
I’m tired and scared,"Today, after years of psychological abuse, my father finally got physically violent as well. 
He threw a vase at me and hit me in the head, then pushed my mother to the floor, all while shouting like a madman.
He was completely out of control, I saw pure violence in his eyes. 
After two hours of him screaming and threatening, I told my mother to leave him, she’s been suffering for 25 years. 
I know perfectly well she’s not going to end their marriage. 
Two years ago, for the same reasons, I went through the most terrible times of my life. 
I’d put out cigarettes on my harms, cut myself, was thinking about suicide 24/7.
I would sit every night on the balcony with my legs hanging from the railings, hoping to find the strength to give myself a little push. 
Today I felt it all coming back to me. 
I know I couldn’t deal with all that again.
I want to die. If I killed myself, my mom would get away from him and be free from all the hurt she’s been put through. She deserves better, I don’t.
I’m his son, fifty percent of my being stems from him. That alone makes me nauseous.
I can’t. I just can’t.
We’ll be forced to live in the same house for months, we’re in quarantine. I’d rather end it now"
I'm gonna probably attempt to kill myself sometime during college,"For so many years I've been putting it off, because people have been telling me ""no dont die"" and hobbies keeping me from doing it but looking on how I've reacted to and treated people, my sensitivity towards everything, I'm going to kill myself. 

Even if I were to continue living what's the point? I'm so replaceable, I lack self confidence to the point where I feel awful about letting people down when I mention that I'm sad.

I'm going to do this. Plan and all. Giving the people in my lives a final goodbye before I do it. At least they have a better look on to why I did it. 

Not gonna lie, kinda scared, but hey we all are gonna die anyways so what makes my death any different? I can literally write anything here about how I'm going to end it and no one I know will find it. Not that they would like what I've written. 

I dont care that I have potential. I don't care that I have opportunities. I just want to die after putting it off for so long.

I hope people care less seeing that I'm an adult. Just to see that I'm just another cog in the machine.

Edit: this got a lot of attention wow. Thank you guys so much for the support! Especially right now when I'm gonna start college soon. This has really got me to think about where I'm going with this and I'm gonna try and get it out of my system. Even tho these thoughts might come back, at least I know where to go when they do."
"Ever feel like you're the most fucked up person in the world and no matter how much effort you put in, you will always be alone and unloved?",Why is the title so long
I want to go to my therapist just to tell her to fuck off.,"I started seeing a therapist. This lady I actually liked. She told me the next time I wanted to cut myself or really wanted to kill myself, to go to the emergency room. I did that. She told me they would give me attention and medication and really help me. I stayed there over night about 8 hours. A therapist in some other city video chatted me after being there for 8 hours. I had to use a prison toilet - in socks. She said I think you’re stable enough to go home and you’ll be fine just keep seeing your therapist. That’s it. Yesterday I got a bill in the mail for $3,711. For that one night where they did nothing. Nothing. I had to reschedule my appointments this month because I just switched jobs and couldn’t afford my co-pay. I have phenomenal insurance and those fucks charged me $3711? After insurance? For locking me in a room so I could video chat some random bitch that might be a doctor. How pathetic do I feel after begging them for help and they do nothing. A lot of my unnecessary stress is money. Why is it so expensive to get help? Why did it take every therapist over a week just to call me back and set an appointment for me a month in advance? Why does everyone tell you to get help but they never tell you how hard it is? It’s so fucking expensive. Getting a bill in the mail for 4 grand when you’re suicidal doesn’t make you excited to live. I now have a hatred for every person in the medical field cheating people out of their money and their health. Fuck you to those people that send the bills and a big fuck you to my asshole therapist. 

I plan to say these things to her in a kinder tone and ask her why she would recommend that for me. I’m really hurt because I trusted her and it only embarrassed me and made my life worse. I hate myself so much and it made me feel even more worthless. I won’t cuss at her or disrespect her but this is my life. I went to her for help. I needed someone who could really help and now I can’t trust any of them. "
2020 will be the year i make the change i want to see in the world!! finally gonna kill myself!!,"all jokes aside—i’m just not cut out for this. people tell me all these things that are supposed to be comforting about life and it all makes me want to die more. i don’t want to try to get better, i just want to die. everything is too fucking hard and i am too fucking weak."
Being gay and ugly sucks,"I’m so fucking worthless. No one wants me and I’m done trying. I’m gonna kill myself. I hate myself for being ugly. My body dysmorphia has gotten worse recently. I can barely eat anything, and I harm myself a shit ton. I think it’s about time to kill myself."
Why do I keep going?,"I wake up and wonder, why?  Why do I keep getting up and doing this over and over?  It's the same thing.  Get up, go to work, eat dinner, sleep.. repeat.  Why?  What's the point to any of this?  I didn't ask to be here."
My cousin/roommate assaulted me last night.. nobody believes me..,"My cousin(roommate) assaulted me last night... nobody believes me...

I moved in with my cousin two weeks ago.. since then he’s been overly loving. He will wake you up and talk to you all day. Literally, the first day there he talked to me for 9 hours straight... even when I went to the bathroom. I have a problem getting black out drunk and he brags about kissing me, watching me in the shower, watching me in the restroom, seeing me naked, I know it’s forced because I don’t like physical contact and I’m asexual that he forces me to cuddle with him when I’m blacked out and don’t remember. He found my phone and has my boyfriends number, best friends number, family’s number and he texts them all day about me and everything I do.. right now I’m having trouble with auditory hallucinations that my family know about, but I’m fixing. My cousin also always talks about raising me and always being a big brother to me... when I’ve seen him 2 times since I was 10 years old...

We have another roommate. My best friend of 7 years. He was in the room and it was 2am. We’d been talking to my cousin literally all day, because we never get a second alone together. My cousin had been drinking all night and refused to go to bed because he wanted to be there when my boyfriend got home so he could “chat” with him about me. But he was so drunk he kept forgetting my boyfriend wasn’t coming over. Finally I asked him if my best friend and I could have some time to talk alone. And he FLIPPED. He began screaming at us that we hate him. Why can’t he hear what I was going to talk about. We’re just conspiring against him.

He ran over to me. Held my arms against my chest so hard that my ribs have bruises, got literally so close to my face he was touching me... and screamed over and over about how he could hurt me so badly and that I don’t know who I’m talking to. He believes he can read minds and see “auras” and said he knows I’m lying. He’s screaming he’s going to beat the shit out of me. I kept telling him to just do it. And then he grabbed my face so fucking hard. And told me to try him. I then yelled that my dad owns this house. And that I was going to tell my boyfriend. And he got scared and backed off. 

Immediately he began texting me about how much he loves me... I left the house and ran down the street to my dads house sobbing. Iv told my mom... my sister.. my dad... everyone believes I was hallucinating.. they said my best friend will say whatever I want him to so his word doesn’t matter.. but he hurt me.. only my boyfriend believes me... I feel so alone.. 

Iv been having flashbacks to my first rape all day.. to my dad beating me as a kid and everyone denying it ever happened.. I’m covered in bruises.. and I wish I was dead.. I just want someone to believe me..."
"Anyone else just living day by day, remembering nothing, thinking about nothing, enjoying very little, and being incredibly lonely, but almost as if it's sort of your own fault? Like you've done this to yourself?","I cannot verbally explain to anyone over a text, or a call, or by any other means how terrible I feel as of this moment. There are too many reasons and too many complicated situations that I would have to explain for anyone to even have the slightest idea of what kind of pain I'm in at this time. 

Maybe I'm being overbearing...

Its almost as if my chest is hurting? I forget everything? I have no drive? I'm going to grow up to be that old man who tells those kids to ""chase their dreams or end up like me."" 

Just kill me. "
I think my heart might explode or just stop working from excessive self inflicted heartbreak,"I just....ruin everything. I don’t know how to function. It feels like all of the air in my body is rushing towards my heart and pressing on it and it’s going to burst at any moment and my chest hurts and I want so badly to just dissolve into earth. Why! Why can’t the world just open and swallow me whole! 

I’m the type of person who invades your life and leaves nothing but destruction. I can’t make this work. I think I deserve to feel this pain sometimes, I just wish I could take pain I cause other people away from them and carry that. 

I hate myself."
bye,"i’ve been diagnosed with persistent depression. i’m going to overdose on anti depressants, pain killers, and slit my wrists. a few months ago my parents sent me to the mental health center, but instead of comfort they were frustrated and pissed at me for being depressed. i have anxiety that never goes away. i’m spending my last day watching marvel movies and sleeping. i’m not going to write a note. probably leave the house around three am and do it by a bridge. i feel at peace thinking about it. the only thing i’m worried about is going to hell. i’m a christian and i don’t want to burn. i want to see God, but i also don’t want to be alive. tonight i’m going to die. thank you"
I don't want to live past 30,I don't want to suffer the horror of having my body slowly expire.
757 ppl online,its comforting to know that theres ppl other than me who feel this way but why am i still so lonely in this feeling. idk if that even made sense but tbh i really just  dont want to exist.
"I'm attracted to children, and now I've lost all will to live.","Ever since I was around 14 I've been attracted to young children. I have felt nothing for women of my age or younger for 15 years now. All throughout my teenage years, I lived with suppressed shame and guilt over my attraction and I was so disgusted by myself. I was afraid of how others would react so I never told anyone and internalized it until adulthood, all while hoping that this would end when I became an adult. When I reached my twenties and my feelings remained the same, the depression that had been building up until then just kind of exploded and I entered a terrible period of my life when I was so depressed and yet I couldn't bring myself to open up to anyone about why. When I looked to the news and online forums, the word 'pedophile' and 'child molester' essentially meant the same thing to any regular person and were all vilified, whether they had acted on their desires or not. This stigma scared me a lot. After a year or so living in the dumps, I was forced by my brother to go to a counselor to receive treatment for depression. I grew quite comfortable around the guy after a few appointments, and being the idiot I am, I thought that it would be alright to tell him since I thought these people were under rules of strict confidentiality. I explained my point of view and made it clear that I didn't act on any of my desires. Still, he immediately told my brother and I was shunned from my entire family, and they made it clear that they never wanted a vile person like me back.

I then fell into even greater depression. I'm ashamed to admit that, in these periods of time, I thought of things such as ""if everybody is going to hate me no matter what, I might as well actually act on these desires and see what happens"". I still clung onto my humanity, and after looking at online resources and essentially giving myself therapy and talking to people online I managed to bring back a little semblance of normalcy to my life. I got a job, I made some friends and while I'm not rich, I could still feed myself without living off of paycheck to paycheck. I was still attracted to children and I was still deathly scared and ashamed, but I internalized it to the point of just living more or less a lie.

I made one particularly good friend from work and I got along well with his family. After knowing him for a few years, I started to think that at least one person I know in real life would understand if I confided to them my darkest secret. It turned out that I'm yet again a idiot and didn't learn anything. A week ago, we were having a few drinks, and I blurted out a bunch of my thoughts and my condition. I was still wary enough to stress that I had no intentions to, and had never harmed a child in any manner and I thought that that would be okay. The thing is, I had met his nieces before when I was having dinner with him before and had even played with them which probably disturbed him. He stopped contacting me, and only called me once out of anger telling me that I had tricked him all this time, that I was a disgusting piece of shit, and that he'd kill me if he ever saw me again. He's presumably told my workplace, and I'm expecting a notice to get fired anytime soon. 

I've lived my entire life riddled with anxiety and depression over the stress of both my condition itself and what would happen if anyone found out. I've been betrayed by even my family completely over this. Nobody understands me at all. The worst thing is, I can't even be angry. It isn't even unreasonable. I pose a tremendous threat to society. I understand that, which is why I fucking hate myself even more for this. At 29, I've lost all connections to anyone I thought cared for me, and now I've lost my will to live. I'm going to hang myself tonight if not earlier. Nobody will even care, so I won't bother writing a proper note.

Thank you to anyone who bothered to read all of this. It just feels kind of refreshing to put my experiences on record like this one last time."
My dad killed himself,"He went missing two months ago and we had no idea where he was for that whole time, and then a week ago someone found his body. He'd committed suicide the night he left. He'd been dead the whole fucking time, two months, and nobody knew. I'm not thinking of killing myself, but I don't know what to do. I've been crying for an hour and I feel like I'm going to throw up, just thinking about how dad's not gonna be at my graduation, not gonna see me score my first goal in hockey, not gonna play guitar with me anymore, not gonna do any of that. I don't know what to do. I'm so lost. "
I'm running out of reasons not to kill myself,"I'm not going to kill myself, at least not at this point, but it hurts to live when there's nothing to live for. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet, and the only reason I'm holding back now is because I know it will hurt people around me. But I'm getting sick of staying alive solely so other people can be happy when I know I'm not going to be happy. 

I hate my past, I hate what happened to me, I hate the decisions I made, I hate my body, I hate my personality, I hate the relationships I have, I hate that I have such unattainable dreams, I hate the world I live in, and most of all I hate that either through the laws of the universe or my own weakness I can't change any of this. 

What's the point when there's literally NOTHING I can find in my present or realistically see in my future that will make me happy. I'm not going to kill myself, but I really, really, really want to."
She’s gone and so will I soon,"She left today for the army, she’ll be gone a long time for training and then she’ll be gone another 2 years on top of that for her actual job. We had known each other for coming up on to two years and she was the only thing keeping me sane. Those late nights when I was on the verge of suicide she would call me and calm me down until I would fall asleep on the phone with her. Whenever I was feeling extra down she always knew what to say to make me smile. I would’ve been dead a long time ago without her and now that she’s gone I know I won’t make it more than a week. She was the only thing keeping me here and now that she’s gone I know this depression and anxiety are going to get the best of me. I just want to apologize to her for not being strong enough to make it through."
Ever wonder how so many people haven’t killed themselves?,"It boggles my mind that there are so many people that exist on earth and just,,, live. They rlly be out here alive. Like if they feel how I feel , how the fuck haven’t they killed themselves yet? Am I just weak? Am I weak for thinking about suicide? All the time? I just can’t fathom the idea that people can live life and see a reason to go on every day. I google searched “why don’t people kill themselves” and the only hits I got were links related to “why do people kill themselves?”  But that answer is so fucking obvious to me. I need to know why they DONT kill themselves."
"A year ago, I promised myself I'd kill myself on the day I graduated college.","It was supposed to be April 28, 2019. Graduation is supposed to be an exciting beginning to the rest of your life, but I don't want anything to do with my future.

I'm not graduating on time anymore, now. I fucked up my last semester thanks to my depression, and I have to withdraw from my classes. But I'm still thinking about killing myself on April 28.

It would be perfect. Ending it all while my classmates are at their commencement ceremony celebrating their achievements. I know I would never amount to anything, regardless of whether or not I make it to my graduation. My depression and anxiety have held me back for my entire life. I've fought and fought but always come up short. It's not worth fighting anymore.

I want to spend the last month of my life doing things I love, or at least the things I used to love before depression grabbed me by the throat and choked the life out of me. I want to finish my album I've been working on for 6 years so I have something to leave behind. I want to spend quality time with my family and friends so they have lots of good memories to look back on once they recover from the initial shock of my death. I want to eat good food, play video games, and snuggle with my dog.

I'm glad I made this decision now. It's given me a contentedness with living that I haven't had for a while. Maybe I'll actually be able to enjoy my last month instead of wallowing in self-hatred and fear of the future.

I wasn't meant to live past 22."
I don't want to live.,"I'm just tired of life. I don't enjoy life and I have no prospects of enjoying life. I'm not in crisis, I just want to stop being alive because I don't like being alive. I feel about life the way someone might feel about a game of monopoly; I just don't want to play anymore. I'm not sure what that makes me."
"TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously, even your doctors and therapists.","Everybody thinks you're just being immature or finding excuses for your failures. The only time they realise that you're really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it's all too late.

You might think the ""professionals"" would act totally different. But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible, and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn't help and wouldn't care as long as it's my life not his child's.

I'm trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days. Don't want to live through a life I'm incapable of living through while nobody cares at all."
I made myself cry because of what I did,"I planned on committing suicide 6 years ago to the date, 5 years ago next week was the first of 10 attempts in a 4 year period. Well today I decided to delete all my suicide notes today, all of them to everyone I wrote one to; which even includes my dogs :’). I have no backups or anything of the sort, it feels so damn liberating y’all I can’t believe how free I feel now. I cried for 5 hours. This is the first step in the road to recovery mentally and I love it. I couldn’t believe I ever wrote those notes, it’s crazy how much better my life has gotten

EDIT: I just got off of work and I wanted to say thank you to everyone that’s been so supportive"
It’s so sad seeing how many people want to die,"It’s so sad seeing so many people post “Well today is the day” and “Goodbye, I’m doing it tonight” like so many people struggle with this thoughts and its something that happens per minute. If this sub only has 120k and so many peoples lives are so problematic that they’d rather just disappear from the world makes me wonder how many people attempt or kill  themselves daily worldwide...

I don’t think the average persons aware of how many people struggle with this issue. Most people who have suicidal thoughts keep it a secret it’s weird and tragic knowing that person sitting next to you is probably the last time you’ll see them again...

Ps: I’m also thankful for this sub like were all in our own little world together where we share our deepest secrets and that there’s people who can actually understand what I’m going through. Feels nice."
I don’t want to kill myself. I want to delete my save file and start over.,"Dying seems pointless. It feels like demoing a building because the pipes are bad. But god, if I thought it would send me back, Russian-Doll style, I’d do it in a heartbeat.

I want to be 13-14 again, and be as loud and persistent as possible about the fact that I was suicidally depressed, even then, and about the abuse I and my family suffered at home.

I want to smack that first beer I chugged at that party out of my hand. I missed the little note at the bottom of the screen saying “this will affect your destiny”. I want to have never started down this path that’s taken so much.

I want to tell the “friends” I had growing up that I am not their whipping boy, then find people who would actually make me feel good about myself.

I want to demand therapy and medication, and take it seriously from the start.

I want to actually have the wherewithal and energy to take college apps seriously, and end up somewhere I wanted to be, not within spitting distance of my family.

Most of all, I want to avoid isolating myself for so goddamn long. I want to avoid becoming a 25 year old who has tons of “friends” but can’t remember the last time he touched a human being.

I realize my mistakes now. I could undo them if I could only have the chance."
Kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me kill me,"Just fucking do it already. Someone please fucking END ME PLEASE. I JUST WANT IT TO END. FUCKING HELL. nothing anyone says really helps anymore so dont even bother just someone kill me. FUCK

Help,"Im standing over my bathroom sink with a knife in my hand, crying and trying to hold on.  Ive dealt with depression since I was a young teenager, so its almost been half my life at this point.  Its ruined everything good that has happened to me in my life.. my friendships, athletics, interests, and my relationship with the love of my life. No one should have to live like this. Ive never been one to show emotion, but Ive cried my eyes out every single night for the past two weeks because things just keep getting worse. I don't see a way forward or a reason to keep fighting.  I need help... please."
I wish there was a 'stop existing' button,I was gonna cut down to an artery this easter but my dumbass thought that it would be a good idea to make a bunch of obvious noticeable self harm cuts on my hand and of course my parents found out and they somehow managed to find my suicide note in my geography copy and they never talked to me about it but my mom showed it to my new therapist when I wasn't in the room. Don't you ever wish you could just disappear without leaving any pain behind like you were never born because god I sure do/// or maybe I'm just being a dramatic attention seeking teenager i don't even know anymore
Why do both of my parents think everything i do is wrong?,"I’m 17 years old and these past few years I occasionally keep fighting with my parents with reasons I don’t even know.

The reason we fight is not because i was doing drugs, my grades are dropping, getting into fights, or anything that could get me into trouble.

It’s mostly of simple reason such as :
When we travel abroad at the hotel the staff seems to forgot to give us some coffee when he/she is cleaning our room. So my parents ask me to called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. So i did what they ask and called the hotel service to bring us some coffee. Then my parents asked what did i say to them. I answered “i just asked them to bring us some coffee”. Then they told me “why did you say that? You should’ve said can you give us coffee since you didn’t put one in the room when you were cleaning the room, and now we will have to pay for the coffee.” I said it’s fine and told them if that happens i will told them we didn’t have it before. They asked me to call the staff again to which i say there’s no need then they keep insisted on it and they start yelling and then we got into a debate
Just because of coffee......

And it’s been like this these past few years 
I mean i get it parents have ego and they want to have some sort of dominance over their kids but isn’t this to much? 
Since then i started to just take the blame to which i thought they would stop yelling to me.
They didn’t 

Just moments ago before writing this post i got into this type of debate again with my parents. 
But, this time i feel this would be the last...

I couldn’t take it anymore i just want to end this all i have no one to talk to and my parents who’s supposed to be comforting me in a situation like this is the one who’s causing the problem.
They keep telling me I’m wrong and after things cool down when i asked what did i do wrong they always answer with you’re not wrong and begin their an hour long speech about life.

I get no one wants to read this and no one cares about a problem of someone they don’t know. I don’t even know how to kill myself or do i even have the guts to do it. All i want is for this problem to stop and look for a place to vent so thank you if you’re reading this."
"Fuck you, 2019",My life fell apart this year. I will turn 30 next year with nothing. I hope I can end it before May. I really don't want to have to keep doing this.
I'm gonna end it all,"Everything is getting worse and worse. My parents value material things more than me and I was almost going to get beaten up today by them. At school everyone is against me and some make the experience a nightmare. I will just run away tomorrow, find a nice tree to hang myself and end it all. The only ""friend"" I have doesn't give a shit, he only wished me good luck when I told him I wanna run away. I'm gonna make everyone happy tomorrow."
Does anyone else feel worthless?,I feel completely useless. I don't think I do anything for anybody. I serve absolutely nothing and have no purpose. Does anyone else feel the same way?
"I want to reach out to someone, anyone but I feel so detached.","I’m hurting so much and I can’t do it anymore. I know I’ve posted before and I’m sorry if I’m vague. I don’t even have words to get the emotions out. I am only 21 but it’s so clear to me now that I ruin everything in my life. I know people love me, but I know I’m not a good person. I know I feel this way because of my own actions and I know I can’t ever fix or make up for things I have done. I don’t see the point in my life anymore. I don’t want to do anything. Nothing makes me feel better. I just want it to stop and I always end up hurting myself again. I know I need to seek help, but I just don’t see a point anymore. I haven’t slept in 2 days and I think I’m done being scared. I’m just done, I hope God is real. I hope He forgives me. I just want everything to stop. I want to say please help me but it doesn’t matter anyways. I’m sorry.

EDIT: you’re all such amazing people, I’ve cried so much reading these comments. Complete strangers who care more than people right next to me is crazy to me. I am still depressed, I am still hurting but I am still here. Thank you so much. I love you all even tho we don’t know each other. I wish I had better words."
"I get really uncomfortable, even anxious, when people say things like ""you deserve to be happy"" or ""I'm glad you're here""",Just wanted to put it out there. I'm sure y'all can relate. :/
Just got told to kill myself,"I guess that’s it.        
   
I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did thank you to everyone that left kind messages you dont know how much they mean to me"
Sometimes I wish my mom hated me so I wouldn’t feel bad about wanting to kill myself,She’s the only reason I haven’t 
I want to be dead but I'm too much of a fucking coward to follow through,"I'm afraid that I would hurt people by doing it but I already hurt people just fine while I'm alive so would it really be that different 

Stuck in a loop. Same shit over and over again. Meet people. People like you. People get to know you. People leave. Repeat repeat repeat. Don't bother falling in love cuz that's never fucking happening. You're a 30 year old virgin. You are not desirable. To think otherwise is foolish. You will be alone for the rest of your time here. However long that is. 

I'm the common denominator. I'm the problem. Always have been. Only one solution. The loneliness I feel right now is the comeuppance for how shitty of a person I've been. For all the people I've hurt. Pushed away. Betrayed. There's nothing left for me here. It's my fault."
Do you ever feel like you were just never meant to be happy?,Everything I do to try and be content with my life just backfires and I end up feeling a thousand times worse. Can anyone else relate?
Do you ever get sudden compulsive urges to kill yourself?,"For me personally I’m not suicidal all the time, but in small bouts. "

I attempted suicide by hanging myself about a week ago. I did not succeed. Broke my jaw and nearly broke my neck.

I would rather not go into details about what exactly happened and how I managed to survive, but I did spend some time in the hospital. I am home now and surrounded by a few loved ones.

I am seeing a specialist this afternoon.

I just called the Suicide Prevention Hotline. And they told me to call back when it’s less busy because I wasn’t “suicidal” or critical enough 🙄,"Talk about a shitty mental health awareness system. I tried to call them because I’m very overwhelmed due to COVID-19 and the ongoing civil unrest in the country. I’m 19, and I have never been this anxious before. I am not actively wanting to kill myself but I am having a hard time seeing the “light at the end of the tunnel.” You’d think the 1-800-273-8255 number would be a better resource, but all they did was shoo me away and tell me my problems weren’t critical enough. I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I’m so scared and helpless right now. I have no job. I am worried for my safety in the US. I don’t feel safe anywhere I go and I’m wondering if it might just be better if I take some pills and end it all. I’m not planning to do this but I can’t see any improvement in the world coming any time soon. I just need help— but apparently the hotline is too busy to help me."
Haha help,"Yes, I am suicidal. Yes, I am ""getting help"". Posted on mobile.

 I don't believe in an afterlife or religion. I only believe in the void after death, where my conciousness ends. With that in mind, dying doesn't seem so bad to me, in fact it's very attractive, especially since I can't imagine myself doing anything productive with my life, or getting a good ending. I think that if I die now, I will stop all possibilities of all problems from affecting me and making me upset. I also believe that even if I was happy or successful, none of that would mean anything in the time frame of the life of the planet, much less the universe. With no knowledge of my personal life or my abilities or personality, I feel that nobody will be able to prove to me that I am unjustified in killing myself. I have had many people make the argument ""your family and friends will be sad"". My reasoning is this: in the void, my conciousness, and by extension, my conscience ceases to exist. This means I won't have to worry about any moral issues, including my method of suicide and whoever finds my body or whatever."

Advice On What To Day When He Wakes Up,"Im sitting next to my little bro, I'm 32 hes 16, in the ER after he took a bunch of my dad's pills last night. There are people who have od'd, in the other beds around us and they are moaning and screaming and my little bro is a shy scared kid that's also on the spectrum of autism just a bit. They are taking him to another hospital with a psych ward I guess and i want to know what advice do i give him to be prepared for what's coming? What do I say to him when he first wakes?

Update: Just want to say thanks for all the advice and suggestions, everyone of them helped and I am gonna do my best to help my little bro through this."
High School (more specifically the people at it) makes me suicidal as f*ck.,"Whoever said high school is the best 4 years of your life is so full of shit. I have never met more fake, toxic, useless, worthless people than at my school. Some of these people make it their life mission to make everyone around them as miserable as possible, just for a quick laugh out of their friend group. I legitimately fantasize about murdering some of these people almost daily. I know I would never follow through with these thoughts, but it's still scary I even have them. Fuck I really just want to off myself, but I can't do that to the people around me. Could I just get hit by a car or get terminal cancer or something?? Why the hell am I even forced to go to school??!?! I don't mean to sound like an intellectual or anything, but I have learned loads more useful stuff from just googling shit I'm curious about, than memorizing bullshit in a classroom. Quarantine has been a dream come true, really. I never want this summer to end, every school year just gets worse and worse. It'll be a miracle if i make it through the next 2 years."

Literally dying inside,"My partner of 16 years, and wife of 6 months, came home from a trip to Ireland to ask for a divorce. Completely out of the blue. Turns out she met someone over there that ""she fell in love with"" (that cut her off, yay) and made her realize she needs to ""find herself"" without me (forever).

Then the other day, after two beers, I failed a check stop and got a DUI. Licensed suspended for at least 90 days.

I am literally gutted inside and think about suicide literally every minute of the day. 

I'm abusing alcohol and cannabis just to get through the day.

How do you even think about the future when you're entire life has been destroyed?

(I already see a psychologist and psychiatrist for Bipolar 2)


EDIT: I'm honestly blown away by the number of supportive comments, and zero negative comments, received from this group. To answer a bunch of questions: yes I am trying to quit alcohol, although this weekend wasn't great, I'm using cannabis for now, I got a prescription for Ativan to get rid of the panic attacks, I was going to the gym daily until I lost my transportation, and I'm struggling to get outside even to walk the dogs. Today's my appointment with my lawyer regarding the DUI... 

Thank you all again."
My dog decided he was going to keep watch today,"I had the stuff ready. But then my dog decided he was going to stare at me and push me back into bed. Now we’re laying here and I’m depressed and he’s curled up next to me.

"I've been reading this sub for the pass 4 hours, and think I don't want to kill myself anymore.","I might be a waste of space and money to everyone I love

But I feel , I don't want to kill myself about it.

 I think tomorrow, I will try to work on it, and hopefully,become something worth loving again : )

Edited: 

I really appreciate your kind comments, but today was another awful day.

A lot of you asked me  to talk about it, so here is more background

 I have to admit, I don't have the courage to kill myself, but I am still hating every minute my life now

My problem is simple. I am sick , not my body , but my mind. I can't fix it, my psychiatrist can't fix it, my psychologist can't fix it. Meds can't fix it neither.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I am impresioned in my own body. This is slowly killing everything nice I had in my life. 

I know you will say, *it's only your mind you can fix it!*. But I am being In this for 10 painful years and there is little to no improvement. Just pain, day after day

Every day , I have to look to ones I love and feel the disappointment. The rage, the sadness of my condition. Today, the same happened , the same way it happened day after day for a decade.

I don't know what to do. I would give everything to be okey again. There would be no price I would not pay, but I feel there is no real solution to my condition than an slow and solitary death"
I think I'm gonna die,"I looked it up and the safest dose is 3000mg of acetaminophen, I took 8000mg of it, I know it takes hours for it to work, but it happened, I don't know why I did other than I want the pain to stop, so I guess I'm just on Reddit for the next while, and trust me, I know it will take days, I just hope I can hide the pain"
Do you ever want to die because you're just so bored of life?,"My life isn't really bad, everything in is just pointless and boring. I just do the same shit every day, all while mildly resenting my existence and life. I won't ever be successful or important enough to be able to justify my own existence to myself."
Anyone else hate waking up,Waking up and realising I'm still alive is one of the worst fucking feelings in the world. It just fills me with dread that I have to find a way to exist for the next 16 hours without hating every second of it
I've come to accept this,"I've accepted that I will do nothing with my life. Die alone and miserable.

I've come to accept my death and I embrace it with open arms. Each day drawing it closer, is a day where I am more and more happy knowing that the pain will go away. It sounds cliché but it really feels like it.

I've accepted that life is a flood, washing over me like waves crashing into rock, slowly eroding it away until there is nothing left but rubble and dust. It feel like I have no control in life. That I am just a person looking into another miserable persons life, who is getting worse day by day, slowly succumbing to the poison known as living.

I know that this sounds very cliché, but this is the best way of describing it. Grades are going down, I'm not loving what I do, I don't feel motivated to do anything anymore, feeling of existential dread is grinding against my soul like a grindstone at a knife, but no sharpening it, its dulling it and turning it into something with no porpuse, no love, no happiness. Hope for a better tomorrow is just fiction at this point. I try seeking help. I go to a psychologist and I try to get better myself.

Im thinking of just writing a suicide note for my parents, been writing a diery of all my thoughts, not well written but it gets some of the thoughts out.

But I've reached a serious low point in my life. A point where I'm looking for other people's advice. An outside perspective if you would.

Sorry if there are some mistakes in my English. Not my first language after all."
considering killing myself this night,"Life sucks anyway; I'll never be able to make it out of boring and mundane modern life.

I'm jsut nobody."
"I admitted that I was suicidal to my boss, and his response resulted in cutting myself.","I, a 23 year old female, am a teacher, rejected multiple times, but now teach yet again. Worded that pretty stupidly but... anyways.

I was reported by some of my co-workers that I have been doing my job poorly. In what way, I don't know. Maybe the pauses in between sentences, dragging out words, or arriving to the classroom 15 minutes late. I went to the principal's office and asked what exactly is preventing my potential. Told him instantly about my depression, due to some advice given to me in this website. He said that I'm faking it for an excuse to slack, or that I'm looking for attention. I just abruptly left.

It reminded me of how cruel and heartless people can be, and how worthless I am in the grand scheme of things. One thing lead to another and... read title.

This abyss keeps getting deeper and deeper."
"No hope, no strenght, no future.","I've spent 2 and a half years institutionalised, going in and out of different facilities. Been diagnosed with SzPD, paranoid schizophrenia, depression and social anxiety. Before that I've spent 2 years untreated, including a year in total social isolation. Was told by a psychotherapist that I was gonna spend the rest of my life in mental health care.

I've since got out and found a job I've always dreamed of having. I am trying to improve and integrate into society, but the effort seems fruitless. I feel like I am constantly lying to people by acting as if everything's alright, by smiling and pretending to be happy. Even my therapist couldn't tell the state I am actually in. Needless to say, even though I told him about it, he didn't help much.

I am taking antipsychotics and antidepressants, following any advice given in therapy. It's just not helping me against this.

I've tried looking for a suicide hotline, but there are no active ones in my country. So I've decided to post here and it's the first time I am opening about this to strangers. Please, don't tell me to discuss this with my family. The last time I've told them about it - they commited me to yet another mental hospital.

I don't believe in any possibility of this situation getting better, my energy is running out and each new day is a dreadful possibility. It won't take me much more to step over the edge, into death this time."
Self hatred,"Every little thing I do wrong makes me hate myself so much more. I’ve done so much wrong I honestly feel like I’m past the point of no return. I really wish my body could just give up and die on command. 

My life feels like it is so far beyond repair. I just wish I was never born at this point nothing in life has been worth this. I will never be happy, and I don’t know what to do with that information. I want to die but I can’t do anything about it.

I wish I could just do something. I never do anything to try to fix my problems I just make more. I sometimes try to fix something but when it feels like I’m making progress I always take 10 steps backwards in the wrong direction.


I will never get better, I can only move downhill. I could keep typing forever about how much I hate myself but there is no point. I will never do anything about it. I am just a bystander watching as my life wastes away. I guess I should just hope it goes by quickly"
"No, I won't be turning 20 in 2020. I already have pills to end it.",Edit: thanks for the downvotes. That's all I needed to know about how much anyone cares.
(serious) Went to my doctor for help about suicide,"For depression and ->ANXIETY<-He called the police despite that i stayed calm all the time.


 Police rushed me and pushed me on the floor, i was so stressed out i couldnt move, and was like a stick (unvoluntary). They said i was resisiting and choked me until i managed to give them one of my arm. They finally handcuffed me and dragged me bottom naked outside the clinic, 2 cops were laughing at me because of that and many people have gathered aroung at this point, and i was still half naked...


 It took 10min for the ambulance to come and to  someone to hide my genital... Nobody took care of my pants and i still didnt get them back... (hospital was just accross the street of the clinic)

They brought me to the hospital for 72hrs and drugged me like i never been drugged before, because at this point (from now own all the rest is my fault) i couldnt keep my calm anymore.

 I was stuck in a super small room where nobody came to see me except to ask me trivial question like my name, adresse, weight etc. Nothing about why i was brought here. So i freaked out often and they shoot me. After this all went smooth. I like the effect of the sedatif so i freaked out from time to time just to get more. (no joke, anyway there was litterally nothing else to do)

They tell me they will transfer me to another hospital (probably because the 72hrs was close to end) I took the ambulance and once i was there... I dont remember ANYTHING AT ALL, nothing, niet, nada.

I have vague memories of me walking toward the main street to get back home, but i was 40min in cars from home... And i woke up yesterday without any idea how i got home... and today i wonder how to deal with all this situation.

P.s. I dont drink alcohol, smoke daily before night, so i dont think my own abuse made me loose the map. Im 35 years old man, never lost counscious ever in all my life before that. And also i have zero violences back ground.


With all this story my question is: ""now where do i go to find help?"" Everything on the Internet say to go see your doctor, but now i can barely get out of my house. It was already very hard but now its unbearable.

 I have constant suicide thought for over 20years now but also have full custody of my 12years old daughter which i love more than anything else in the world. (she's in no danger whatsoever i took care of telling her mom what was happening to me so she take care of her)

P.s.2. Im sorry if its hard to follow or understand, im french from Québec and there isnt much french forum to get help."
there is so much pain in the world,"and i don’t know, i just wish there was more that i could do to stop it. i feel so responsible for all of the bad things people have done to me, because they have been through something bad themselves. september is just such a horrible month. there are so many horrible anniversaries, and so many tragedies. i know three people now who died in this month. my friend recently became homeless. i’m struggling with my studies. my sister told me about her abuse. it’s almost been one year since i tried killing myself and i’m still here, crying about everything and never really reaching out. i never do anything right. i just wish i could undo death, or do something to make things better for people. i wish i could die knowing it would impact nobody. i’m so alone. nobody really seems to care. i really wish every action didn’t have an impact.

i don’t know, i think this is a cry for help? i feel like i’m going to do something stupid and maybe at this point it’s not even stupid. i’m so sorry that i feel this way, partially because i’m sorry that i’m not living my teenage years happy, but mostly because i know i’m probably gonna end up killing myself even when i know it’s gonna hurt people."
I no longer want to die.,"The past few months have been difficult but I think I’ve finally come out of this depression. The day I was going to end it all, my boyfriend come over and took me for a long walk. I finally realized I have something to fight for. I know there will still be hard times in the future but right now I’m living in the present. Thank you to everyone in this subreddit for helping me. Keep fighting.
Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to get so much attention. I'm glad to help. <3"
I started researching how to kill myself,"I haven't done that in a looong ass time. That's how I know I'm back at rock bottom.

It's the only thing I can focus on. Probably cause it's the only thing I care about now. Everything else is just fucking brain fog."
Am I the only one who finds thinking of suicide comforting?,"The fact that I can always kill myself is really comforting to me, it gives me a feeling of control of my life, that in the end I can decide my fate, and no one can do anything about it. 
It's weird, some days this is the only thing that keeps me going."
I rather kill myself then working my entire life for greedy ceos and corrupt Politicians,"You need money to live. You need to work for money. Well.. I don't want to work the rest of my life, even with the occasional vacation because I'd still have to return to the job. Similar to how no matter how happy/better I temporarily feel(rarely) but return to depression once my mind takes over. I can't do this for the rest of my life, nor do I want to.. so I'm thinking about it..

So please god why won’t you just take my life and end the suffering here and now!!

"No one wants to deal with sad people, but get angry when they decide to do something about it.","I’ve reached out to people before and they just get hurt. They can’t handle it because it’s too much or too sad or they don’t have the time. It’s honestly fine. I understand that no one is obligated to listen to me or give me any of their time, but I know these will be the same people who will be upset if I’m gone. My sadness is so inconvenient that they’d rather me stay sad and destructive for the rest of my life than have to deal with any of it. There is no fix for my problems and I feel like it’s selfish for them to want me alive when they know just how awful I feel. They don’t have to help me, but they shouldn’t get mad when I try to help myself.

More context: I’ve also done therapy for 3 years and been on multiple meds for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I exercise, practice self-care, and try to do my hobbies when I can pull myself out of bed. I have tried everything else to fix myself. I worked really hard just to keep falling to the same low point."
If I kill myself my mom will be absolutely devastated.,"That's really the only thing keeping me here. I woke up depressed (as usual) and found a package with my name on it. My mom had got me a pair of earrings for Valentine's Day along with a card telling me how much I mean to her. Instead of making me happy, it made me really sad. I don't deserve this. "
Isn’t it kinda bullshit that you can’t confide in anyone that you want to kill yourself without being committed?,"If you’re in such a bad place that you’re thinking of killing yourself but not at the point to where you’re in immediate danger of doing it, shouldn’t you be able to admit this, without being held against your will at a psychiatric facility that your insurance probably won’t cover, work won’t be happy about your absence at, where you’ll be given meds against your will and not allowed to leave?

What if I could admit this to a psychiatrist/therapist so that we can have a discussion about the most appropriate med + therapy combo to get me on the right track?

Because the idea of just trusting random mood stabilizing drugs being forced upon me as I’m whisked away from work and my daily life and not allowed to live my life or leave for 3 or more days *wouldn’t exactly inspire me to ask for help in the future*.

What if I could just be candid about how I feel so that I can get treated? Can’t imagine that I’m the only one who feels this way. Makes me feel horribly alone. How can I best be treated if I’m withholding this from my healthcare providers, when I’m not in immediate danger? Surely I’m not the only one who struggles, with this concept?"
Threw all of my bullets in the river this morning.,"I'm not gonna lose. This isn't gonna beat me. Last time I felt like this, I threw my firing pin into my back yard. Once I felt better, I found it, cleaned it, and put it back. 

But at this point, I don't think I can ever have a gun again. got rid of the bullets first, since without them, it's useless. I think I'm just gonna drop it off at the police station and tell them I don't want it anymore.  


It's just so hard to fight. I don't want to be alive. I want to die. 

Things have happened to me in the past two weeks that could break even the strongest person. 

I found out my ex, who I still cared about deeply, was beaten to death. She died cold and lonely, with nothing. In the street in front a a fucking Salvation Army soup kitchen. She stole clothes to stay warm. And some asshole decided she needed to die for that. 

I found out that I have cancer. Even best case scenario, I am in for a ton of pain and misery. And that's if I even make it. I really hope I don't. 

And then, to top it all off: 

I got the girl of my dreams pregnant. 

The baby is gone. 

And she won't talk to me, at all. 

I'm not even sure what happened. Did she abort it? Did she miscarry? Was she trying to keep it? I can't get over the fact that I may never know the answers to these, and so many more questions. 

Like, we knew she might be pregnant. And she seemed to not hate me. But then, all in one message, she tells me that she was pregnant for sure, and now she isn't, and she doesn't want to talk to me anymore. 

How can you just give someone news like that and then disappear? 

I kinda wish I still had those bullets. And that's why I needed to throw them out. 

Even if no one ever sees this, it felt good to get it out. I have a therapy appointment in 8 days, and I'm just trying to hold out until then. "
I will not kill myself before I haven't tried everything,"I have made this decisions when I thought about suicide a lot last winter. I was ashamed of myself because I think that I gave up way to early. I am fighting against mental and physical health problems and I will not give up until I tried everything to improve my situation.
I hope you guys do this to it's really good to look at things that way.
Edit: Thanks for the silver u/DrHitshot I hope you are doing well!"
It’s really sad how lonely being suicidal is,"Like, you can’t talk to anyone. 

And if you can, it’s like maybe one or two people. Half of them are probably your medical team, who check in with you once or twice a week, and are paid to care about you. 

You know all your “family and friends care” but it’s impossible to talk to them. You don’t want them to overreact. You don’t want them to worry. 

You can’t hang out with your friends anymore because you have nothing positive or noteworthy to say. No one wants to go to dinner or to a bar and hear about how you hate living. You don’t want to bring the mood down all the time. 

And the one person you trust to talk to can’t handle all of your stress. You can’t rely on just that person. It takes a toll on them and stresses them out too, so now you start censoring yourself and feel like you can’t tell them everything. 

And then you’re just stuck with your thoughts in your head. Wondering what’s the best thing to do. 


And then there’s the planning. 

What to write in your note saying goodbye. What to do with your dog. How to leave your apartment. What date to set. 

I just wish euthanasia was legal so I could die with my friends and family by my side. I wish I could talk freely about my thoughts and plans, and have support in my decision. I wish someone could be by my side in my last moments. 

But no, I have to do this alone. And it’s so lonely. 

I’m not afraid of dying. I’m slowly learning to not be afraid if I fail trying to die, and die suffering slowly and painfully. I just wish I wasn’t lonely through it all. I wish someone could hold my hand and hug me before I go.  "
"A few months ago I set a deadline. That deadline, March 12 has arrived.","When I last [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5mmg7z/i_set_a_deadline/), life seemed completely miserable with no possibility of it getting any better. I continued living day to day, mostly miserable and feeling absolutely lifeless inside. I continued my daily activities with that fake smile so no one would suspect my plan to jump off that bridge with a rope around my neck. Then an unanticipated trip abroad to an exotic land halfway around the world popped up. Then came an out of the blue reconnecting with an old friend. Then came a tiny puppy into my life.

"PSA from the SuicideWatch Mod Team: We're getting a lot of complaints about generic ""uplifting"" or ""I love you"" type posts and comments. Please read and follow guideline 4c in the sidebar.","We realise that most of the people who put up posts and comments of this nature want to help, and, if they haven't read the guidelines, it probably hasn't occurred to them that this might not be the right thing to do. But a) it's likely to backfire and b) there's no excuse for not reading the rules!

Responding to a suicidal person with messages like this (excerpted from a recent responder who we'll keep anonymous because they probably meant well):

>  You are not a failure. You are smart, you are young, you have an entire life to live. It is not impossible to become that person you want to be. You can be great.

is incredibly invalidating. If the person you're talking to were capable of believing that, they probably wouldn't be at serious risk for suicide.  And inflicting anything on them along the lines of ""you can do anything you want"" or ""life is worth living"", just disrespects their feelings and increases their sense of personal failure, because they can't do what you told them to do, believe what you told them to believe, or feel what you told them to feel.  As feeling like a failure and/or a burden is one of three most critical risk factors for death by suicide, it is not hyperbole to say that ***these so-called ""empowering"" messages kill people***.  

Guideline 4c links to [a previous PSA post](http://redd.it/1cep2h) that covers in more depth the reasons why this sort of ""cheering-up"" is absolutely against the rules here.  If you have any questions, please [shoot us a modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23SuicideWatch).

**Edit:**  One other very dangerous type of message is ""It gets better"".  Because of the prominence of The Trevor Project and other similar initiatives, a lot of people seem to be coming to us with the idea that ""It gets better"" is not just an okay thing, but the *best* thing, to say to any suicidal person.  Nothing could be more wrong.  ""It gets better"" comes out of an initiative to reach LGBT youth who are being bullied and harassed in school.  And the getting better refers strictly to those behaviours, which *do* get better, on their own, with time, as people's peer groups get older.  It's a message intended to keep these kids from getting to the point where they're at risk for suicide.  But as a ""hopeful"" message for someone at risk, it's worse than useless.  First, it makes promises on behalf of the Universe - and the Universe may not keep them.  Second, it offers no understanding, but devalues or even trivializes their agony.  "
"I don’t even know how to say this but I feel like this is a good place to get all of it off of my chest, if I even can or honestly even finish this post. I know I’m suicidal but I don’t know if I will do it","Basically, the depression began in 2014 when my dad killed himself.

No one in my family saw it coming. He never showed any indication that he was suicidal, except for his drinking, which he did when everyone was asleep and he never, to my knowledge, did anything bad while he was drunk. I remember one time noticing a bunch of empty beers in the recycling and mentioning it to my mom. Looking back, he drank because of his demons but no one noticed.

For two weeks after my father ended his life, my siblings and I thought he had gotten in a bad car accident and died from his injuries. I believed her because in a way, she wasn’t lying but I’ll get to that. My mom told us after two weeks the true story of what happened and how he had killed himself and left behind letters for each of us. We were waiting for the police to hand them over including some other possessions.

Now later on, we found out about what happened. I think there’s still stuff about his or my mom’s life I don’t know. Stuff about that day. But here it is:

The day before, I remember my dad saying he was going off for hockey. I think I said bye but I don’t really know. That was the last time I ever saw my dad alive.

The next day, I’m waking up for school and I find out that my mom and my brother had been up for a while, talking to police. My dad was missing and there had been a car crash.

At school, I confided in one of my teachers about the situation and I was worried at all times.

I get home and play video games with my brother. My dad is in the hospital and my grandma is watching us while my mom is at the hospital. A little later, my grandma gets a call from my mom telling her to come down to the hospital and bring us. A cop car comes and picks us up and drives us to the hospital. We arrive, discover the death of my father and my grandma’s son, and I’m freaking out.

For a bit, I thought I had heard that he was just in really bad shape. About 10 or something minutes after “finding out he’s in bad shape” I discover that instead, he is dead. I went blank with crying. I was horrified. I was whispering to myself “no” constantly and I was rocking back and forth.

Rocking back and forth when I’m nervous, scared, tired, sad or any other bad emotion became a habit since that day.

I ended up going into the room where my dead father was lying, along with my mother and seeing him dead was horrible but his eyes were shut and he always had a soul patch and it was crooked so I was able to laugh to that and get to say goodbye.

I go home after a while along with my family. My brother was at the hospital and my sister was not. At this point, she had no clue that her dad had died. She was off at university far away and my uncle drove to her to pick her up and drive her back. She was 4 hours away. That’s a long trip. 

She was freaking out because a friend of hers, who heard what happened, sent her condolences about her father without mentioning that he was dead. She was picked up and was so freaked out and worried.

I fell asleep and at 1am when I woke up, I go downstairs to see my sister sitting in a chair crying and balling her eyes out.

My sister, who I barely see show emotion or cry. Someone who’s older and I looked up to. And she was destroyed by this. I went up to her and hugged her.

My siblings are never affectionate. We hate each other or at least that’s what we tell each other. My brother and I’s way of telling each other that we care about each other is saying “You’re a bitch”.

So hugging my sister, something I don’t remember ever doing before that or much after, was a big deal.

This ripped my family apart.

Here’s how that day went for my father:

He was driving back from hockey when he suddenly crashed his car. He got out and left the scene. He walked through the fields so GODDAMN close to my house, and eventually went and bought paper, a pen, a knife, probably some other shit and went to a hotel. He checked in and I don’t know how long he was in that room but what I do know, is he wrote out his letters. There were many crumpled up papers of letters he scrapped. The police found out about the crash and where he was by now. They were getting to his room when he was in the bathtub and slit his wrists.

I have convinced myself in the past that he only killed him self because the car crash messed with his brain. But the truth is, he tried to kill himself with a fucking car crash. To make it seem like an accident. And he failed. But he couldn’t take it anymore so he slit his fucking wrists even though he knew we would realize what had happened. My dad was so depressed that any way of ending it was good enough. He never tried getting help and he left his family.

I hate my dad for what he did. But of course I also miss him. This whole post has already taken so long to write because I had to take breaks so I can have mental breakdowns.

I was originally going to explain why I’m depressed but after writing all of this out, instead I’m going to say you know what, I’m not even going to continue. I am suicidal but I won’t do it any time soon so I can explain the many shit in my life that has caused that in a later post but I’m going to use this post to say that...

DO NOT KILL YOURSELF
Please don’t.
Don’t do it.
My dad killed himself and it destroyed my family.

I didn’t read the rules of this sub so maybe this post is going be deleted or maybe I’m not allowed to bring up certain things like how it is done, but people already knew about that.

My life sucks because of my dad.
He’s the reason I want to kill myself and he didn’t even try to get help.

I hate him. I love him but god do I hate him.

My mom has her own hand in my depression which if I ever do another post, I’ll get to, but my dad is the root cause of everything awful that has happened in my family in the last 5 years.

PLEASE
DONT
KILL

Does anyone else feel like they HAVE to attempt suicide or at least be checked into a psychiatric hospital to be taken seriously?,"It’s not like breaking a bone. If I tell people what’s going on, I get a “yeah I feel that” or “mood” ffs dude I want to stop breathing."
this is just absurd like WTF,"who the fuck made this world?
who the fuck made such a sad ass system?

im tired of living this way, where everyone look at you as a robot
as a ""you only here to do homework, we only spend money on your ass to go to school and later you need to find a job""

is this really it? life = money?
what are we? arent we humans? 
why cant we treat eachother with value and respect despite our wealth, looks?

why cant we love eachother and help eachother?
i feel numb, i feel frustrated that this is what we human really are, a greedy little fucks who only care about themselves
maybe not all of us , but the majority
of us are just like that 

im so tired of going to school to just ""get shit done to get to work to get money to survive""

and i say survive, not live happily
because there is nothing happy about our misrable world....maybe there is things you can enjoy or should i say now its just to ""destract myself from my constant suicidal thoughts and my depression""

everyone look down on you because ""you are a disapointment and you got no wealth""

everyone CAN rise you up and respect you because ""this man is a successor!
this man got that company ! this man is blah, that woman got the money""

and honstly....i undersrand how delucional everyone is but....i think we took it way too far

we are losing ourselves in our shit show
and im tired , i cant live anymore in a fucked up world that is
as a fucked up person that is me...

i want this nightmare to be over...
im tired of how we humans are associated with our school, work like we are slaves to our survival
if you want to survive in a crule,fucked up world go ahead....

but im so tired of always being a slave to my needs...i dont want to burden, bother anyone with my survival

honstly i dont care about furture,success,work,relationships
and life ingeneral

i just dont give a fuck anymore...its all meaningless to me
its all gray and pointless to me
like why am i even trying to do that or that? to just breath? to survive? to not end up homeless?
fuck this shit and fuck survival and fuck money fuck people fuck fake friends fuck relationships who they love only your looks,money
fuck family who treat you like a fuckin dog,slave
fuck everything and lastly
fuck me and mylife
soon i will die....
to free myself from my constant stress and my constant highly depressed ass

im tired of living... everything always gets the best of me

edit : also i forgot to mention...
why didnt god just make us less greedy 
make us less ""you have to eat, sleep,work to survive"" why didnt he just made us pure souls wandering around 
enjoying nature? without the need of food or anything? so we all could love eachother and FINALLY no more rape, war , murder
its all frustrating
why did god made us with so many flaws?
why cant god just free us from our suffering? 
the answer is simple ....it might be for ""reasons"" we humans dont understand
well why couldn't he just make us understand why he made us..
or it might be just for his entertaintment
just like us humans
when you are bored....you go watch a movie or something
maybe we are only toys and a show to him..
there is no exuse nor ""reason"" is justified to him for making us suffer like this

is there REALLY a good reason for him to make us suffer like this?? especially depressed,sucidal people? 
like you realize you dont live that badly you start to feel super guilty about anything to the point only death will free you from your constant guilt 
i didnt ask to be a suicidal asshole
i didnt ask to have a very close minded
family
i didnt ask to have such a fat body from the start
i didnt ask to be addicted on unhealthy ways to cope with my depression...
yet there are religions who tell that when you kill yourself you go to hell
REALLY????? like....oh wow
now im really being forced to get tortured

lol sorry if i sounded rude, i'm just frustrated :("
I'm a doctor. I'm done.,"I've had enough. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm working my ass off but the patients just keep coming and just keep dying. I have a bad depression at baseline and this pandemic is just throwing me over the edge. 

&#x200B;

Last month I contacted the suicide hotline and they sent the cops to my door and dragged me to the hospital. I was able to convince them to let me go but the ordeal was expensive and humiliating and awful. I'm never doing that again.

&#x200B;

I have to stay up all night because I'm scheduled to start the night shift tomorrow. I'm lonely and bored and a little drunk and just want this all to end."
I hate it when I see attractive people online tell everyone that they need to learn how to love themselves .,Title pretty much explains it. It makes me feel worse about myself and it makes me want to end it even more. I feel like if they were in my body then they wouldn't be saying shit like that.
I just feel trapped,"Sorry if this feels all over the place, I'm just adding as I remember.
Also looked back and see it's a wall of text, apologies.

I grew up in a somewhat dysfunction Asian family.

- i grew up being bullied for my eyes as I have a lazy eyelid, leading to one eye being ""larger"" than the other, I would try to be friends with people but they would shun me and tell me to fuck off in little kid terms. Eventually after moving to a different school ( I went through multiple elementary schools due to some of the reasons below) I made some friends and it was enjoyable. My met my best mate Ryan who would about 15 years later, would kill himself. My group of friends stayed the same from elementary and would expand upon highschool and this is when Ryan would start to drift away. He had family problems of his own and he would attend school less and less over time. I still course myself for not reaching out as I thought he was doing ok, I started attending university this is when I learned he killed himself.

- my father was an alcoholic and being Asian, beatings weren't uncommon as punishment. There was a time when my mother, sister and I stayed at a relative's place for a night or two when my father was drunk enough that he fell over, injured his head, and wasn't in the sanest of conditions.

- my brother died when I was in grade 3 from some medical illness which I still have no idea what it was as I was never told and never asked as my mother suffered immensely from his death and I don't want to bring any of that back. Some of my early grade school classes would have daily diaries where you would write about stuff that happened daily, just writing practice I suppose. There was a day where I wrote about how my brother recently passed and how I would be attending his funeral very soon. My teacher read this and let me know that she was there for me etc. This soon made it to my sister who was about 5 grades above me but still in the same school building. Her teacher asked her about the funeral and I don't know what she said in response. Later at home, she told my parents about how I told my teacher about my brother dying and now the teacher(s) knew
 They berated me, telling game how such personal details should be kept between family and not be told to others. Perhaps this is where I started to feel betrayed by my own family and learned not to tell my family anything as I would just get shit on for sharing.

- my mother and father divorced while I was pretty young and while my father doesn't mention my mother when I see him, if something goes wrong such as my mother misplacing a document, she would blame either me or my sister for ""letting him into the house"". She would assume things such as him stealing documents that she misplaced. There are memories of when I was young, I would wait for my mother to come home from the hospital from visiting my brother and I would come downstairs to see her
 She would hold me and cry to me about my sick brother.

- my mother soon started dating again and I remember that she was dating 2 guys at once I think. Some lawyer guy and some other guy she met at work. She asked me which one I liked better and not to tell the Guy A about the existence of Guy B. I didn't know what was really going on as I was still in early grade school at this point but it was only in the past couple years I realised that my mom was essentially seeing two guys at once.

- my sister is doing great, she has a good job and married last year, has good friends, great husband and such. I'm genuinely happy for her she was the first in my family to graduate university and prosper.

- My parents work in a factory and immigrated over from China so this was huge. I'm similarly trying to graduate and my family set me up for success. My father gave me money for university fees but I spent about 40% on dumb crap like amazon items or games as I was about 18 at the time, and it's not like I grew up learning how to manage my finances, I was and still am young and stupid. I started to run out of money and had to take some time off university to work to make money. I told my parents who I was living with that I needed a break. If I had told them the truth they would have looked at me like a pathetic human being which I am but..... I wouldn't have been able to take it. They accepted my lie and so I found a job and worked. 

Eventually I went back to university and resumed my course work but they expect me to graduate at the end of this semester which isn't possible with the course work I'm still missing but with the lies I've told them, it makes sense why they would think I would graduate. My situation is entirely my fault and I don't know what to fucking do. 

To top it all off, I play far too many video games as it's my escape. Recently, my grandma died on my father's side, and when my sister called to tell me, I was still playing video games as an escape. She could hear me playing and told me to ""get your shit together, grandma just died and you don't give a shit"". I do, I just can't express emotion anymore, not to my family after all that's happened. She told my mother and she similarly thinks I'm a human bag of garbage at this point. And I honestly don't blame them. My sister told me once that I am the source of problems in the family and she's not wrong. I agree with her, and it makes me feel all the more shitty because of the truth behind it.

Some of my cousins are similarly in university and they're doing great. A bunch of my friends have graduated and are living their best lives and I'm happy for them. I just see how I'm stuck in my position because of my own actions and I feel absolutely miserable. 

There's more I can write out but it's already a large wall of text.

My university has counselling services I can use but it's fucking worthless when you trying to make an appointment and there's a waitlist..........

I can't even get a job relevant to my degree during university as I don't have co-op. All job listings I've seen for internships list having a GPA of 3.0 minimum and I hovering around a 69% average which is about a GPA of 1.33. I can't get a job without experience and I can't get experience without a job, and my decreasing GPA certainly doesn't help as I can't even stick my foot in the door.

I just don't want to be alive anymore. I just want it all to stop. If I kill myself my family will likely be sad for a bit, but being a source of problems they would also likely be better off in the long run if I'm not around."
"""But you are just 30, you still have your whole life ahead of you.""","LOL, you serious? It's not that i'm just 30yo, it's that i'm ALREADY 30yo and there is pretty much no chances of fixing my fucking life anymore, can't you fucking understand that?!

I have no fucking skills, no friends (never had), never had a relationship, got fired from the jobs i had, have a garbage ass curriculum, anxiety, depresson, childhood traumas, tinnitus, getting fat, have no savings, no will, no motivation or purpose in this fucking life. I find it funny with this fucking bullshit of ""only 30yo"", i'm fucked, there is literally zero chance of me being able to fix my life and being able to function like a normal or semi-normal human being. Fuck this garbage ass existence, fuck this planet, this country, my parents, fuck this bad joke called life."
Why are people saying that anyone under 18 can't be depressed?,"I've seen people say that, and that once you're 18 shit only gets worse, so anyone under 18 shouldn't complain. Are we really just that annoying?"
I'm going to enlist,I've been suicidal for a while now but I never had the courage to go through with it.. so I'm going to enlist in the military instead... Atleast I won't die in vain with everyone thinking that I'm a loser
I am a deeply stupid person and I feel completely hopeless,"For most of my life I've just been blissfully unaware. Classic stupid person attitude that I was special and unique, with no evidence to back it up. Recently, my life circumstances have forcibly shoved me into doing some reflecting, and I can come to no other conclusion than that of being a gigantic fucking idiot. Just all around dumb. It makes me want to kill myself when I consider that this is fundamentally who I am at my core. Here are some examples of how I know I am a deeply stupid person:

1. I smoked weed throughout high school and did the bare minimum to pass my classes and get into college. I never gave a shit about my major, but just sort of blindly accepted that I was going to college now. I graduated, after having spent most of my energy partying, with a degree that left me $75,000 in debt. I got a job in my major, but was laid off after three years. During my time at my job, I don't feel like I advanced at all, because I was incurious, lazy, and overall unengaged. I showed up half an hour late almost every day. I was a graphic designer, but didn't save any work for a portfolio, so I have nothing to show for it. I've been unemployed for almost a year. I can trace this unfortunate circumstance all the way back to high school, when I didn't have a care in the world. This is also a reflection of my non-existent critical thinking skills. If I had any foresight or insight into problem solving, I would have planned SOMETHING for myself throughout the years. Instead, I coasted through life as if I had no future, with no plan, no thought, and no fucking brains.
2. I can never remember anything. I can't remember names or events, in movies or in real life. Because of this I don't really have any opinions. I forget everything nearly as quickly as it happens. A friend of mine recently watched The Fellowship of the Ring. He was trying to have a conversation with me about some of his favorite parts of the movie, but it was all lost on me. I've seen the movie at least a half dozen times, and I would consider it one of my favorite movies to watch, but I literally couldn't remember anything from it. It's like this with everything. I have a cursory understanding of several hobbies and interests, but I am unable to focus long or hard enough to learn any sort of deeper information in any meaningful way. I'm a bore in conversation because I have nothing to say, because I've never really learned anything. This causes me to have very low self-esteem. I'm too stupid to remember anything, learn anything, or participate in the world in any way that is remotely interesting.
3. I am fundamentally lazy. For as long as I can remember, I always have taken the easy way out. I chose my college because I knew I would get in, and then I tried as little as possible. I spend most of my days on my phone, endlessly scrolling through Twitter and Instagram. I don't take the time to develop hobbies or interests, because I'd rather vegetate my life away in a stew of mediocrity and boredom. I lack that fundamental trait of the intelligence: curiosity. I tend not to dig deeper into subjects that may potentially interest me. I'm so fucking dull I put myself to sleep. I can't keep things clear in my head. It's always a jumbled mess. There's no order to anything I do. I always have an empty fucking look on my face that says ""VACANT."" Even if I tried to learn something, I'd just forget it anyway. I'm going to lose all my friends because I'm so self-conscious about my idiocy that I get jealous of them for the smallest things, such as reading a new book or baking themselves cookies.
4. I can't keep up in conversation or follow directions. Usually I just sit there quietly. I live with three very intelligent and creative people, and when we're all in the same room together, I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority as I listen to their conversations, which are clever, insightful, funny, and informed. I sit there quietly and feel like an idiot. I literally don't say anything. I have nothing to say. It's like this with everyone. I can't keep up. I'm slow and stupid. My friends are going to get bored of me. Who would want that around? Nobody will ever hire me because I'm stupid and empty.
5. I lack emotional intelligence. I don't know how to make people feel better when they feel sad. I don't know how to tell people what they need to hear when they're feeling down or when life has thrown them a curveball. I'm an emotional black hole who takes far more than I could ever hope to give. There's something fundamentally lacking in the way I treat people. When a friend's family member died recently, I didn't know what to say to comfort them. I said ""I'm so sorry. I'm sending you love."" It's not enough. There's something missing. I'm so wrapped up in my own problems that I can hardly see outside of myself. I find my own emotions and the emotions of others to be a total mystery. I wish I could help people. I wish I could help my friends feel better when they're upset. I never know what to say or how to say it. I come off as robotic and strange. I'm going to lose all my friends because I don't know how to be a real friend when it comes down to it.

These are just a few small examples. My idiocy extends into every area of my life. It covers my entire reality. Not a moment goes by that isn't informed by the fact that my brain is just not a very good one. I have official diagnoses of depression and ADHD. Over the past couple of months, I've diagnosed myself with narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and autism spectrum, but I've finally reached the conclusion that my primary affliction is mild intellectual disability. I'm simply slow and stupid. My intelligence is low. It makes me feel suicidal to know that I will never be able to have an insightful conversation. I'll never be a scientist or an artist or a political theorist. I'll never be able to be in a meaningful relationship or raise a child. My brain function is low. There aren't too many connections being made up there. I don't know what the point of going on is. I know I write kind of snappy, and it may deceive you into thinking that I'm smarter than I think I am, but please trust me that everything I've said is true. I just simply can't keep up with anything. I can't keep anything straight. I can't communicate or engage in a meaningful relationship. I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do. I hate the person that I am and the person that I've always been. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm so ashamed."
I'm never calling a hotline again,"Yesterday was the second time they called the cops on me. I begged them not to, i refused to give away my location. They still found me, shoved me in their van and took me to the hospital. At the hospital i waited 5 hours for someone to talk to me before they got a mental health professional then, who i had to regurgitate my entire life story to before being promptly dismissed. I would have rather just died than go through all of that. "
"This sub really helped me, just wanted to say thank you.","I'm using a new account, but previously with my old account I posted here quite a lot. One of my friends discovered my old Reddit account and all the posts I made here, and we had a pretty lengthy conversation about it.

This sub has some of the most genuinely helpful people, and I really wanted to say thank you to everyone who reached out and helped me on my old account. 

&#x200B;

stay safe everyone."
I reach out for once and get fucking denied,"I want to kill myself, but in a last ditch I tried the suicide hotline online chat. I was actively participating when the person said they were closing the chat for inactivity. I responded probably less than thirty seconds beforehand. I have to talk to someone online because no one in person believes me, but even that didnt fucking work"
I got arrested buying drugs off the darknet that I intended to kill myself with via overdose and now I am facing a felony and 5-8 years in prison. Whats the point in continuing on?,"I have been depressed for a third of my life (the last 10 years).  I have attempted suicide by overdose (opiates, benzos and alcohol) 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time I woke up the next day and continued on like nothing happened.  The second time my parents found me and EMT s were able to narcan and resuscitate me.  The third time I overdid it on a benzo analogue with not enough alcohol or opiates to stop my breathing and ended up coming to 7 days later.  I don't know if I was unconscious for those 7 days or what but I was incredibly week, dehydrated and disoriented.  That was almost a year and a half ago.  Every time I survive I try to give life another shot and every year I find myself worse and worse off.  I know I am incredibly lucky but I wish I succeeded the first time and someone more deserving survived their suicide.  I feel like I am in the movie office space, everyday feels like the worst day of my life.

I don't want to go into the exact details of what led up to me ordering off the darknet this time.  My life had continued to deteriorate and I had gotten to a point where I could barely take care of myself.  I stopped going to school after a number of small failures caused me to get discouraged.  I lived in my apartment, only going out to get groceries, go hiking and snowboarding.  I asked my parents to take care of my dog because I loved him too much and he deserved better care than what I could offer at the time. 

Its not that my life is necessarily terrible, well at this point it pretty much is, I had a wonderful childhood and was blessed to have my own place to go to college and be able to hike and snowboard.  Its that I have so much self hate and zero confidence and feel like I don't deserve what I have been given.  I am terrified of failing so I take very few chances and unfortunately even when I feel confident enough to take a chance I end up failing which brings me down further.  I feel like my life peaked after high school, not that it was amazing or anything but to this day it is my greatest achievement, I graduated with full IB, honers and a 4.11.  Unfortunately when I first went to college I had a series of events/failures that destroyed my self confidence.

Anyways back to earlier this year.  This was going to be my 3rd attempt at finishing my degree and I had failed again.  I have been lonely and single for 3 years, my last girlfriend cheated on me, and this Christmas my work at the last moment made me stay home so I spent my very first Christmas completely alone while my family all spent the holidays out of state.  Things were going downhill and again I was getting more and more depressed.  I started getting out to go hiking and snowboarding less and less as it became difficult to even get out of bed and make sure I had food to eat.  At this point had lost my job, my friends were sick of hanging out with me because I was too negative.  I felt like I was only living for my parents but even they were sick of my bullshit and lack of progress in life.  I made the decision to order drugs off the darknet, as I had done a few times before and do it right this time.

My package was intercepted and federal marshals did a controlled delivery.  I was arrested and sat in jail for 2 months.  I'm always surprised when I think that life can't get any more unbearable and jail was just that.  After that I was forced into drug treatment for 6 months and am now living in a sober house under close supervision.  My court date is a month away and I am facing a felony and up to 8 years in prison.

I have tried everything to get better I have a therapist and a psychiatrist.  I have tried nearly every anti depressant and am currently on wellbutrin, which doesn't do shit.  I have tried DBT and TMS.  I don't understand why I should keep going.  I have completely fucked my life up.  Even in the best scenario I will probably get the felony and multiple years of probation.  I'll be barred from a ton of jobs that I was interested in.  I can't even get a job at 711 right now because apparently this is already showing up on my background check.  I probably will struggle to get housing in the future.  I can't even imagine having to go to prison much less for 8 fucking years.  I just feel like this is torture, every day that goes by is another day closer to my judgment day.  My friends and family have abandoned me.  I was evicted when I was in jail and lost most of my stuff, I'm broke.  It just doesn't make sense to keep trying.  I feel like I have gave it multiple tries and its just been one failure after another.  I am so fucking lonely but as much as I would love to have a girl in my life a part of me thinks it would be too selfish of me to make someone have to deal with my bullshit and never ending stream of failures.  What is the point?  Even if my life weren't a complete shit show I would still feel this way.  I just feel like I am pointlessly torturing myself at this point.  This whole year has been like a nightmare that I can't wake up from.  Sometimes I wonder if I actually succeeded in killing myself and this is just my punishment.  I forgot what it means like to be happy, to be close to someone, for someone to actually be proud of me.  I feel like I am just a disappointment and I might as well just end the pain instead of waiting for my court date.  I have already pretty much decided that if I get prison time then I will do it but I fear I wouldn't get the chance if that happened.  I felt so helpless in jail, they specifically make the cells so that it is pretty much impossible to kill yourself and that was the situation I feared the most in life.  Losing my freedom, my humanity and locked away in a room with no stimulus with no way out and no way to kill myself.  Why should I continue to wait around for that to happen?

I

"
I wish that nobody loved me.,Then I wouldn't have to feel guilty for wanting to die.
I find myself crying more in public spontaneously,"It's happened before when I was starting to work years ago but at least I could hold it a bit until finding a place to hide and cry, but now it could happen anywhere. I can barely hold myself together enough to not tear when family visits. Or in the line on the market, or in a restaurant. Yesterday I just started fully crying on the street and obviously people stared at me. 

It's humiliating. And I can't control it.

I'll have to learn to calm myself though. Please don't give suggestions, possitive thinking has never worked for me, it actually makes me feel worse."
Boyfriend's classmate jumped off a 6 story parking garage yesterday,"He wrote a note and everything. Nobody knew a thing, he was so successful, athletic, smart, social. He was friends with everyone. All my boyfriend can say is how depressing the air at school is, how low everyone is, how it just hit everyone. This person took their own life. They're gone.

All I can think about is myself. How many times I've attempted it and failed. How much of an asshole I am for wanting to put that suffering onto others, and yet how much I want my death to impact people. I feel like I'm not suffering bad enough if I don't kill myself. At the same time, I'm convinced suicide is no longer even an option taken how many times I've survived.

This other kid was so strong, so brave and so powerful that he was able to leap 6 stories up to his death. He wrote an elaborate note. He kept his mouth shut about his inner turmoils and nobody knew a thing. On the other end is me, I've done nothing but fail at everything including trying to kill myself, and I feel like my only personality trait is my trauma. Everyone knows I'm depressed, because I can't help but overshare. I feel like I burden loved ones with my thoughts and feelings. And I can't do it.

I'm so ashamed of myself."
My dog just passed away,"I started considering to end it all a little while ago, when im drunk i have the strongest wish to do it

Then, i remember my parents, even if they love me for the sake of social norm, i have those two with me, i couldn’t bare to make them suffer like that, especially my dad, who loves his family the most

Currently (me, 23, my mom, 57, my dad 59) we had a dog, she was so loved and well treated, she was so smart, dad and i loved her like it was my little sister, my dad relied so much on her emotionally

Long story short, she got run over, we got her treated, this morning we found her dead

I already had serious depression, family is already struggling to bind itself, ive got no interest at all with nothing or nobody, i already had fear, about loneliness, about my father, and now i fear even more, i fear that he will age more quickly, that he will not fulfill his obligations, we could lose our house, i fear that he will die soon too, if he dies i swear i kill myself in the moment

I have already lurked and sadly, posted here 

I know i will not kill myself now, so if any of you wasted time reading this rn, please go help more critical people

I just don’t have anyone to tell this, to tell my problems, yo relief what I feel, and just wanted to note this somewhere

Im just convinced more and more and more to the point im 99% sure that i will have myself killed on some point, i just want to die but also im concerned about my dad and i have plenty of fear"
I think the main reason why I don't kill myself is because I don't want my cats to be sad,"Title sounds like a joke. It's not.

Me: 41 years old and I've never, not once in my adult life, felt that I belonged anywhere. My childhood wasn't bad (no abuse or anything like that), but my parents divorced shortly after I was born. I have no memory of them being together. Looking back, I spent a lot of it being passed around. Sometimes I'm living with my mother. Sometimes with my father. Sometimes with my grandparents. Meanwhile, no one was much interested in teaching me anything or raising me or developing a bond. They were just keeping me alive. My parents were young and stupid (both were 20 when I was born). My grandparents were giving, but distant. They gave me junk food and plopped me in front of a TV.

At some point, around ten years old I developed a stutter and could hardly get through a sentence for most of my adolescence. I couldn't even say my own name. I remember being 15 and 16 and wondering how the hell I was going to get through adult life constantly struggling to talk. I was seriously thinking that I would have to pretend to be a mute and somehow make that work. It was preferable to burdening everyone with me trying to say a simple sentence. 

Today, I'm still a stutterer, but I can work with it. Stuttering is awful when you're young and aren't yet comfortable in your own skin and are constantly grappling with insecurity. 

When you've lived with it for awhile though and you've been around the block, you can get good at hiding it. You get better at choosing your words. You also care less about everyone accepting you. With that burden off your shoulders, a stutterer can get by all right. Even when you have the odd tremor, it's more a conversation piece than an embarrassment. 

Yet, I still feel like I don't belong anywhere in this world. I never joined the rest of the world. I have no real friends. Family connections are tenuous. The family I was closest to are all dead (my mother passed on Christmas Day 1998, due to liver disease from her heavy drinking; my grandmother passed in 2005).

I thought I would be done with all of this loner outsider shit by the time I reached my 40s, but I'm not. And I don't know why. Maybe I've made my bed here and I don't know how to make it anywhere else.

One thing that I can say about myself is that I'm not angry. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't hate anyone. My situation is no one's fault, except mine, and people have risen from much sadder circumstances than mine. My story isn't anything special.

I've just always been sad. I don't know how to be anything other than sad. And I hide it. I HATE the idea of burdening anyone else with my problems so I keep them bottled up. I cover up my problems with either jokes or lots of aloof mystery depending on how much I like the people I'm around.

I've thought about suicide. I've stared at pill bottles. I've given serious thought to razoring my wrists in the bath tub. 

BUT I've never done it. Never even tried. 

My feeling about suicide is that you should do it only after you've exhausted EVERY last possible move that might make you keep yourself alive. Hate your life? Change it. Quit your job. Get a new one. Change your habits. Talk to someone, even if it's a bartender. Start painting. Start a blog. Learn how to play guitar or how to knit or how to build something. Come up with a goal, even if it's very modest and silly. If it's not self-destructive and it gets you to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, it's a good thing. Maybe it will lead to even more goals that you want to be alive to accomplish.

Last year, when I was feeling really low and ready eat a bottle of sleeping pills for breakfast, I reached out for my idea of a life line:

I adopted a cat.

A young cat. Five months old. A girl with a lot of life left in her. 

I brought her home and after she spent about an hour exploring my lonely apartment, she jumped into my lap and went to sleep.

And I started crying. Overcome with emotion. I knew right then that I loved her. And that no matter how sad I am, I need to live so that I can take care of her. 

A few months later, I thought that she could use another kitty friend so I adopted another cat, a little boy, a few months younger than her. 

After a rough first week, they eventually became friends and I now love them both equally. In fact, all of the love in my heart that nobody seems to want I shower on these two cats. They get nothing but endless affection from me. I only buy them the best, most healthy food (according to my research, at least). I talk to them and play with them daily. If I somehow won an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris or somewhere today, I honestly don't think I would want it. As sad it may sound, I'd miss my cats too much. 

A cat's love is interesting. They place no importance on pleasing you, so they don't cuddle with you or jump into your arms on command (at least my cats won't). Sometimes they do though, and it's amazing. Cats look at you as their servant, which, to me, is funny and cute and a role that I'm happy to fill. It keeps me sane in a weird way.

Meanwhile, cats do become attached to you. Mine follow me everywhere. They sleep next to me (or on me) in my bed. If something scares them (the sound of the garbage truck or a thunderstorm), they run to me for protection. We hide together underneath a blanket.

I love them so, so much.

They haven't cured my depression, but they have given me something to live for. The thought of them going back to an animal shelter or ending up on the street or with someone who doesn't love them as much as I do all because I had to be an idiot and slash my wrists is too awful to think about. They belong with me and I belong to them. 

And my cats are both young. My little girl is a year and three months; my little boy is about to turn 1. 

Helping them live long, healthy lives has become my goal. These cats could conceivably be around for twenty more years. And I need to be here to serve them. 

I can't kill myself. I've got a job to do."
Does anyone else think about suicide/death a lot but won’t actually do anything?,"I just feel like death is constantly in my mind. I wonder when it will be. I wonder if it’ll hurt and what happens after. I often fantasize about dying in a horrible accident that way it wouldn’t be as bad as suicide to my family. Just to think whenever I’m driving it’s just a pull towards a tree and I wonder what’s stopping me. 

I’m not trying to promote this thinking at all! Just wondering if anyone else gets these thoughts? It’s just like death wont leave me alone."
Does anyone have a hard time understanding how all people aren't actively suicidal,It makes no sense to me 
Emergency: I'm A Suicidal Teen and my family is trying to end my life.," 

.I won't give much context, but I (14M) got into an extremely heated argument with my Dad over my academic future. I remained respectful, **but he started beating me** and he told me how I'm crazy for liking history and video games, and that I'm gonna suffer and die alone and that no one and nothing will ever love me. I started crying, a lot, and was going to kill myself, by jumping of our roof. However, my Dad grabbed me and started beating me, whilst telling me that I wasn't his son anymore. I ran upstairs to my room, and locked the door (we have a special lock that can't be opened and I used that). **Mom's not helping either, and she started beating me as well** because I ''upsetted her and God by wishing for suicide''

It's been a few hours now, **and I'm extremely suicidal and I will certainly take my life unless I get immediate help from someone. I** have no trusted friends or adults around, and I live in a shitty third world country that doesn't have a good police force (besides they'll sympathise with my parents), and no emergency helplines. My phone has no battery either (im typing om computer), so I have no helpline I can reach out to (I think).

Please anyone, someone, I need some support of any kind. A simple DM, or something else like a helpline. Please, I really don't wanna die, but I feel so useless.

Help me.

**Edit: I'm British, but I'm living in Pakistan, if that matters.**"

"25, around 10k in debt, failed university, and today testicular tumor diagnosed. See you on the otherside.",Babe i love you forever
Just survived an attempt. Dealing with aftermath.,"I tried to overdose on Xanax and alcohol Sunday night. It wasn’t planned. I initially took a bar to ease some anxiety and I ended up going a few too deep. It was an impulsive decision based on recent heavy losses and overall trauma. Apparently I posted on my social media that it was my last post and my reasons including losing my boyfriend, best friend, and rejection from an interest and someone called. I don’t remember writing the post, the cops and EMTs showing up, the ambulance ride, or anything. I woke up very confused. I had dozens of supportive messages online but I can’t help but feel very stupid and ashamed. Did I just label myself a crazy suicide girl? Will people forget? Just looking for support right now. I want to crawl under a rock. I’m in weekly therapy and see a psychiatrist but I don’t know if it’s enough."
Does anyone else ever feel like they are destined to kill themselves?,I'm at the point where I don't even feel the sadness nor the depression. I'm slowly losing sense of my identity and feeling a vast wave of emptiness. I feel like my life isn't even mine anymore.
Im overdosing right now,"Im sorry but these may be my final words. I am setting a bot to disclose my personal information if i dont cancel it.

EDIT: I was discharged from rehab today at 10AM. My posts on snapchat ended up getting 911 called. I recovered and was diagnosed with ""Severe Depressive Disorder"" I threw all of my drugs away. I am a sober man and i am living better.

Once i start feeling suicidal my anxiety goes away because nothing matters anymore.,Am i the only one?
"Ever see any of your childhood photos and think ""Someone should have killed that kid."" or ""I'd love to go back and time and end them.""?","I know that is beyond dark, but I'm just wondering if I'm not alone in that line of thinking. I admit I was adorable, but sometimes I think about everything leading up to now and wonder if an earlier death would have been best."
Does anyone else feel suicidal almost everyday but not act on it ever?,"When I say not act on it I mean I've never self harmed, never attempted any kind of suicide or damage. But everyday I wake up feeling like whats the point? The main reason I haven't is fear in case I mess it up and I am in pain or disabled for the rest of my life and the other is letting people down, worried my fiance and Mum would blame themselves.

I highly doubt I would ever do it but this is the worst I have ever felt. I have been fine for a while, got engaged just 2 weeks ago but now I am bad again.

Just looking for people in similar situations to talk to"
I failed,"A couple of days ago, I finally decided to end my life. I decided, after years of being suicidal, that nothing is worth it anymore. So I went into the shower, put on some chill music, and sat there for a long, long time. Long enough for the water to get freezing cold. I used a razor and cut all over my body and just sat there, staring at the water hitting my body and washing the blood off of my skin. When I finally got out, I put on my dirty ass pajamas I’d been wearing for a week, and went into my room. I tied a belt to my closet door and put my head through the loop. As I felt the belt tightening around my neck, my fight or flight instinct kicked in and I freaked the fuck out. I immediately stood up and scrambled to get the belt off of my neck. I couldn’t get it back over my head and I was hyperventilating. When I finally got it off, I was just shaking like a leaf. I sat on my bed and stared at the belt for a long time. I ended up telling one of my close friends about what happened, and they came into my room, took my belts and all my long cords and my razor and gave me a long hug. But now, I’m sitting here, in my school parking lot, avoiding going to class, and I’m regretting calling her at all. I wish I had just waited until I calmed down enough to try again. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to be alive. And now I’m gonna be watched with too much scrutiny to do anything else. I fucking hate this. I just want to drive my car off of a bridge. I can’t do this anymore. Maybe when I go home I’ll gather all the pills I can find and try again. I can’t go into school. I can’t face the fucktards I call ‘friends’. I can’t face the people who were supposed to be there for me. I just want to go home. Not back to my house. Back to where I came from. I want to go back to the earth. I want to become one with the universe again, I want to send my energy out to be recycled in the making of new planets again. I wanna be stardust.

Edit: I’m okay now. I’m out of crisis mode and I’m just trying to take each day as it comes. Thank you so much for your kind words and support, it’s helped a lot. Thank you."
It really sucks to have realized that life is meaningless at such a young age,"I realized it when I was 16, I’m 18 now. There really is no point, you grow up, you get a job, you try to make money but always end up not having enough of it, then you die. It’s really sad because I wish there was a purpose but in reality there really isn’t. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of how sad I know my mom and dad would be. I couldn’t do that to them. They are so loving and they work so hard in this meaningless life just to do the same thing every other mid level family does. I probably won’t ever kill myself, im too much of a pussy, but god does it suck always wanting to be dead.

Thanks for all the support from everyone:) it has made me a bit happy to know that a lot of people understand. If you’d like, my whole situation is on my other post on my profile. Give it a read if you really want to understand what I’m going thru"
My depression has made me become such a good liar. It’s frightening.,"When you tell everyone you’re okay but you’re actually not. 

You promise them you won’t do something, but your mind tells you otherwise. 

It’s hurts being under such intense emotional pain. 

It’s hard seeming like you’re the happiest person out there and fully functioning but know deep down inside while you’re alone that you’re so fucking unhappy. So fucking unhappy. "
Do you ever want to just fade away?,"To fade away like the smoke from a cigarette and no longer trouble myself or others. For all the memories I'm involved in to disappear with me and all traces of my existence gone. That's what I wish for. 

I don't want to have to deal with this mess I've created anymore and I don't want anyone else to have to clean it up after me. Why can't I just disappear? It would be so much easier for all."
Nobody even reads my SW posts,"I’m tired of being the stupid kid that can’t fit in. I’m tired of being lonely and having no friends. I’m tired of always being the worthless piece of shit no one cares about. 

I just want to die. Nobody would care if I killed myself. I wish I just did it in sixth grade."
People only care after we are dead.,"Honestly the worst part of the process of recovering from mental illness, is no one cares enough to lend a helping hand despite knowing our situation except the one person you’re paying money to, the therapist. And then once we actually are gone, they start caring. Until then we are alone in the fight, and are judged for not getting through the storm alone. 

I wish it was different but it feels like I am a laughing stock and stepping stone for people to trample on as some trash along the road. It’s great "
"You ever just have everything going for you, but you fuck it all up?","Life was going well for me. High school was a breeze. I got into a good university for engineering. I had a great social life and an amazing girlfriend/bestfriend. 

I fucked it all up.

It began with me being lazy in university. I procrastinated many assignments to the point where I ended a quarter with 3 F's. I try to fix my grades by the end of the school year. Still have GPA above 2.0, so not kicked out yet. However, my FAFSA application was declined because of the poor performance. That was the only way I could afford classes as I did not want to go in debt.

I decide to do work and earn money. I got a job at McDonald's and, luckily, did not have to work in service, only production--which is great since I'm introverted. I work there for 6 months and decide to quit one day. Thought I'd be able to find a better paying job, but that proved to be more difficult than I imagined. 

That same year, I had relationship issues. Around the end of February of last year, I found out my gf had cheated. Though, it was explained that it had only been a day of her cheating and she had only kissed the guy. I decided to forgive her and continue. Fast forward to May 2018, she leaves me for the same guy and fucks him. I'm too in love, so I decide to give her another chance. 1 week later, I catch her sending nudes to the same guy. I forgive her again. 

December 2018. Same time I quit my job. I'm unemployed. 6 months since the last time my gf did anything (I had been with her for 3 years, this was the one year it was bad). I'm looking for jobs, but no one is interested. I'm struggling.

January 2019. 20-year-old Honda begins to die. I'm left without a car for a month. Girlfriend decides to leave me (To be clear, she meant the world to me. She was the only one close to me). I'm heartbroken. In a desperate attempt to save our relationship. I walk to her place, 10 miles away, a 4 hour walk. I promise everything...that everything would get better, and I would fix myself and our relationship. I'm rejected. I'm starting to lose it. 

I can't live in this world without her. She was the only one, the only reason I kept going. We talked of marriage and our future plans a lot. It was a set path, and just like that, it's gone. February 2019. The last time we talk.

I have no one to talk to. She was the only one I could talk to about my personal problems. I had no other close friends. My relationship with my family is almost nonexistent. I'm stuck with all this hurt, and have no way to let it all out. I begin to hang out with my friends online, and begin to hang out with them irl. I tell them about my break up. ""That sucks,"" they say. That's all I get. I expected as much....

March 2019. Me and a few of my friends decide to get jobs at a warehouse. Pay is decent and job isn't that demanding. I could do this.

Since the break up, however, I haven't felt happy at all. I struggle sleeping. Any thought of her would just make me depressed. There's no escape from her. So many things remind me of her. I can't listen to my favorite music anymore because she enjoyed it. I break down one day and decide to message her. I explain that in sleepless and would like to talk to her in person. No response.

2 weeks after getting that warehouse job, I get fired. I hadn't shown up for 3 days without notice.

I'm a failure.

Same week, I learned that someone had stolen my identity back in 2012. I learned about this after doing taxes and stuff. IRS stated that I owed $4,000 from 2012. I was 11-years-old then. I didn't work. So I have that to deal with now. On top of that, I owe $2,000 for my car.

Recently, I've found out my ex has moved on to someone else. There goes my chances of ever fixing that again. To add, being with my ex allowed me to hang out with her group of friends whom I loved to hang out with. Since shes no longer with me, I'm no longer friends with them. They were a big part of my social life since sophomore year of high school.

So now, I'm a lonely, lazy, desperate, struggling failure that wants to end it all. I have a history of cutting. I cut so deep freshman year that I have huge scars on my left arm 5-6 years later. I almost committed suicide by stabbing myself, but I pussied out. After what happened to me and my ex in May 2018, I tried committing suicide again through overdose (unfortunately I lived and kept the attempt a secret from my friends and family).

I could have stayed in university if I had just done my homework. I could still have a wonderful girlfriend if i had fixed our problems sooner. I could be making money if I wasn't a quitter. I'm worthless. 

I've tried so hard no to think about suicide, but it seems to be the one thing I desire most now. I have nothing going for me. My relationship with other people isn't strong enough for me to stay. If I live, I'm only going to live in regret...wanting nothing more than to travel back in time and fix everything. I want to die so bad. I'm only 19, but I dont think I'm going to make it to 20."
What else can I do instead of suicide?,"Could I run away to some obscure country? Would I leave my old identity behind leave my mum make a missing person report?

Should I just do something completely fucking stupid and Fuck my life up more? At least if everyone knows I’m useless then they won’t expect anything good from me and I’ll be left alone. 

I don’t want to kill myself that badly but I don’t want to continue living, not like this. 

My situation isn’t even that bad, I just can’t get this anxiety, insecurity, overthinking, depression out of my fucking head. For years and years I’ve been trapped. Maybe escaping for a little while but always reverting back and almost always worse. 

I just cannot be fucking bothered living anymore. Im tired 24/7. Socialising is so difficult with this mess in my head, and all I want is friends and a partner but all I do is lose friends and isolate myself because I’m fucked in the head. I just don’t know what to do, I feel like maybe I’ve got some undiagnosed autism or something because I just feel like my brain works differently and i just DONT know what to do about 95% of the time. My “cool confidence” is completely fake, I’m just trying to fake it till I make it but it’s obviously fake, I just embarrass myself again and again. 

Maybe I’m asking for advice, maybe I’m venting. This subreddit is so great, I can relate to so many other sad souls and that makes me feel a little bit better.

EDIT: Thanks for all the great replies everyone. I wish I could give a meaningful reply to all of them but it would take too long. <3 you all"
We're all suicidal people who tell other people to stay alive,"In most cases, that's the truth."
"Does anyone else love sleeping because you get either dreams or a sense of nothingness, both of which feel better than being awake?","I sleep a lot. As much as I can.

Feels good to fade away and stop existing for a while.

When I have dreams I dream I’m a normal, happy person. I dreamed recently this girl I used to know was my girlfriend. She was having dinner at my place with my family. My parents looked so proud.

If I don’t dream, the sense of oblivion is great too. 

Maybe that’s why I want to die so bad. It’s basically just sleeping forever."
Does anyone else feel a sense of calm and peace when thinking about suicide?,"I do, and it scares me. I used to feel panicked and anxious when thinking about suicide and, which would end up in a decent crying session.

For a while now however, I just feel calm and relieved when thinking about it. It's nice to feel that there's always a solution available if things go badly wrong, or if I'm too stressed, when all my life I've only heard to just suck it up and keep moving on to fuck things up all over again.

I just want to know if anyone else has had this, because thinking like that scares me. I don't want to end it, I know my family cares about me, and I don't want them to suffer.

I've had these thoughts for a long time now. The difference is that I don't think negatively about suicide now.

Thank you for taking the time for reading, please share your thoughts/experience if you can and want to. It would help me feel I'm not alone."
Ever cried so quietly that the people sitting next to you don't notice?,"Sometimes tears start falling down my face because I just can't stop them. I have so much pain inside me that it come out randomly when I least want it to. 

I was sitting in the living room with my family and I started crying over something my friend said in jest. I just sat there while my ""family"" went on with whatever they were doing. They don't give a Fuck about me. I feel constantly ignored, invalidated, pushed away, silenced and neglected. Nothing I say is taken seriously. My feelings are cast aside. I've stopped trying to make them see how hurt I am. Their just too blind. No one cares about me.

If I die, No one will care, so why not do it? Not like there's anyone stopping me. I have access to knives, ropes, ladders, a body of water and strong medicine. I have options on how I want to die.

No one will miss me. No point in stating in this fucking dimension."
Does anyone feel this?,Does anyone feel this weird feeling where you think you aren't suicidal but you constantly want to kill yourself but then you feel like you're faking being suicidal?
I graduated tonight,"I graduated tonight, and I honestly did not think I would live to be here for graduation. I’m kind of proud of myself."
Mental Hospitals never work,"So a bit of backstory: In my state, if you show any sign of wanting to hurt yourself or others, can you be forcibly sent to a mental hospital (for a max of 3 days) after going to the ER to check if you've tried anything and being assessed by a psychologist (for at least 30 minutes). 

This has happened to me twice. The first time, I only got assessed by the psychologist for about 10 minutes but thankfully I was released after a few hours.

The second time however, was much worse. So I went to the ER, had to stay overnight, wasn't seen by a psychologist until 2 days later AFTER being sent to the mental hospital (which I'm 99% sure is illegal). Also, I didn't get registered into the mental hospital's system until 6 hours after I arrived because the nurse had to do other stuff. Not to mention while in the ER, I overheard nurses complaining about all the different patients. While in the mental hospital place, I never actually got better. I just trained myself to be all smiley and happy. Because no one wants to be around someone who is depressed.

&#x200B;

TLDR; mental hospitals cut corners, don't care about you, and teach you to repress and hide your feelings.

EDIT: some other bs at happened at the second time (which was at a university hospital, btw) included: 

because my family was calling so much the psychologist outright complained to me about how they were making her job harder. 

My mom tried to make sure i got evaluated before i left the er but while my mom was talking with the nurse, the nurse hung up and said ""im sorry, but this is getting annoying"" right to my face.

A diabetic girl was basically being starved because it was the weekend and they couldnt get a nutritionist on the weekend, so a nurse had to sneak her sandwiches.

While at the ER, i overheard nurses/service techs complain about the mental health patients."
I’m not even going to bother using a throwaway,"Try as I may, every evening ends the same. I can drink 8 gallons of water, ace a job interview, run a marathon, and by the time I lay in bed and stare at the ceiling the same thoughts race through my mind. “I don’t want to be alive.”

I love that communities like this exist. But, at the end of the day, a suicide hotline or a stranger on the internet telling me “it’ll be okay, buddy” doesn’t fix the fundamental problematic default setting of my brain.

Chronic depression is hell, plain and simple. It’s a constant uphill battle. And lately I feel like Sisyphus, no matter how hard I push my disease up a hill, it’s going to come tumbling back down to crush me under its weight eventually.

I’m so tired of pushing stones up hills. I’m so, unbelievably, fucking tired. "
I wish I could die without killing myself,Like I wish i could just get into an accident and die then that way I wouldn’t have to do it myself. Idk it’s fucked up to think that but I think about it all the time
I deserve to die because I’ve done awful things,"Not saying what they were. They were not things I knew were wrong till later. If I had known then how much it would hurt people I would never ever done it. I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I have and I haven’t meant to. So all my suffering now is punishment for doing the awful things I didn’t know were awful till much later."
"SELF HARM AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ARE NOT CAUSES, THEY ARE SYMPTOMS.","I'm sick of people focusing on stuff that will return if you you dont help with the main issue, it's like taking away a kids phone cause they are suicidal"
Life is a precious gift. So the creator should love it when I give it back.,It doesn't get better. It really doesn't. 
"I'm sick and tired of people telling me ""you're too young to be depressed""","I am 11 years old. My dad committed suicide when I was 8. As he was a stay-at-home dad, I had so much experience with playing with him and talking in general. I haven't really talked to many people or made relationships with anyone following that event. Seemingly every week some adult is telling me that I'm too young to be depressed, like damn when did they make an age cap. I've thought about suicide for the last 3 years but have only tried once, which failed bad, but recently with people comparing depression to my age constantly it makes me want to try again.

thanks for reading

Edits: hey guys, I just want to thank you all so much for the 30+ positive messages you have sent me. I never expected I would get more help in under 24 hours than I ever had in 3 years. As much as this makes me happy, it also comes to my concern s that there are some horrible people browsing this Reddit. I have received multiple messages telling me to do certain things to myself. Here is an example: https://imgur.com/gallery/tdYcb"
I just want a hug,Is that too much to ask
School is just so fucked. Most of the people on this sub are students,I fucking hate everything and this is the 3rd year in a row that I’d just rather die than put up with this shit. I just don’t want to hurt people around me. 
vote up if you think i should live (ha),"title is some humour because intergalactic laws dont matter right now

i dont think i will be alive much longer, a month away seems very far. my last week has been very up and down and isolated and i dont want to be around anyone

the one thing that calms me is when i think to myself and decide that i will kill myself, it is strange because then things are very temporarily a little easier to handle.

i had written up a very long explanation of my life before but it somehow got lost.

the only reason i havent yet is guilt of how it will make my parents feel and sister feel. i could see one or more of them killing themselves after or at minimum the rest of their lives being horrible. this world has hurt me so much and my family and they dont deserve to be hurt even more.

i wont be letting anyone know. part of what hurt me in the past were medications doctors experimented on me. everything made things worse and they didnt listen to me; none of them interacted with me how expected.

so i wont be telling anyone, they will end me up in a hospital and force me on medication (at least that is my fear and that is worse than being dead and i will explain that to my family as to why i didnt tell anyone)

and please respect my wishes and not say anything about medications and how it takes time to find one that works for you, etc..  i am very sensitive and medications are too strong for me. the only thing that helps are therapies i cant afford, i cant afford rent either. i dont want to explain why it is difficult for me to get work. i am very high functioning mentally however that makes more basic tasks more stressing for me or boring

there is no real support either, not unless you pay them which isnt real support imho either. i was seeing a therapist, stopped two weeks ago"
"""talk to someone"" yeah I did and it's pointless, rant","Talking doesn't make anything better, it just means one more person knows how fucked up and far gone I am, and they can't do anything about it. I've come to realise that there's no hope and I'm better off alone until I can go through with completion. Fuck my brain and demons, I can't wait until I delete myself from the gene pool, such a rejected waste of fucking oxygen and space"
I'm waking up tomorrow.,"I was sure of it. Tonight was supposed to be night. My depression was always there, but something told me that tonight was the night I would end it all and relieve myself from this pain.

But I didn't. 

I found myself crying for 2 hours, and then finally picking up the phone for the Suicide Hotline. I spoke to the most wonderful person on the other end. He told me I was strong, he told me I deserved to live, he told me I was a good person. He gave me a new perspective on how to tackle life. He saved my life.

So, for now, I put the tools away, the notes away, and will not send those texts tonight. Because, for better or worse,

I'm waking up tomorrow."
My parents are emotionally abusive and I'm thinking about killing myself,"Hello. I'm depressed. I want to say I'm an introvert but I really am not. I love being with people, laughing with people, sharing stories with others, but I'm unable to relate to anyone. I feel alone. I have my family but that's the problem. My parents are the problem. Ever since I was young they were overly protective of me and never allowed me to go out with friends or have sleepovers with our neighbors. This left me with the disability to socialize well. I am now unable to relate with others, I don't know how to talk. I don't know how to form a bond with others. The worst part is my parents don't give me any attention. Every time I talk to them I feel like they're not treating me like I'm a child and I don't deserve to talk to them. Everytime I open up about being lonely they just tell me to ""grow up"" and stop being emotional. I'm already 18. I feel so confused. I feel sad, I cry often. The only things that put a smile on my face are my dogs, video games, and Netflix. Other than that I have nothing, no one. I want to be a strong person and be capable of living without attention from others but I doubt I'm capable of that. I'm very emotional. From the past few months suicide was always on my mind. That's probably because I feel really lonely, and also because I want my parents to emotionally suffer too, because that's what they did to me.

Edit : Sorry if I can't respond to your comments. I just want to say thank you to all of you. You guys are actually willing to help me and that made me feel important. Thank you guys."
im killing myself on my 17th birthday,"i dont care how my family will feel anymore. i dont care how sad my boyfriend will get. i will never be happy and ive come to terms with that. ive been suicidal since i was a kid for some unknown reason. i wanted to walk into traffic, ive been self harming since i was 6 or 7 without really knowing it. im angry at everyone all the time and cant talk to someone without being belittled or causing anxiety. ive gone through therapy and tried pills. ive been hospitalized and nothing works. ive planned it and im in the process of writing my note to my boyfriend. i hate myself and everyone in my life. i hate myself so much. i really cant do it anymore. dont try to convince me otherwise it will not work."
"Goodbye, r/Suicidewatch.","Not long ago I posted here. This throwaway then went dormant. After struggling a few months after I had posted, I had a breakdown in front of a friend. He talked to me for three hours and helped me as much as somebody who isn't me could help. I continued to fight my own personal battle.

I won. I fucking won. I learned to not hate people anymore (Go ahead and read the other posts if you please). I learned to enjoy life again. I'm smiling as I write this post. I've started helping people as much as I could, and being my gamer self I've sent steam gifts to people who can't afford their own hobby (better gaming than drugs or something, right?). Hopefully this is the last time I'll ever post here. It's kinda funny looking back and seeing myself one month ago. I'm a totally new person.

So... Goodbye.
"
I can't stop crying. I can't shut my brain up. I can't function and I can't stand it and I need to make it stop.,"I'm sorry this is so rambly and incoherent, I'm sobbing so fucking hard and I can barely breathe but I tried my best to make it make a little sense and to break it into paragraphs at least.

Last week I got in an argument with someone I was close to and said things to them that really hurt them because I was hurting a lot myself.  It's things that I didn't and never ever would actually think or mean but they just spilled out because I was hurting and terrified and my brain just...broke.  I know that's no excuse, I hurt them and it's awful, that's all there is to it, I feel horrid and I always will.  But yeah, they said and did hurtful things too, it was bad on both ends.  I ended up in the hospital on a 72 hour hold.

As a sidenote I realized a few hours after the fact I'd forgotten to take my depression/anxiety/etc. meds the day of that fight and I hate myself so damn much.  If I ever forget them (which happens from time to time because I have quite severe ADHD that makes me very forgetful) I get especially sensitive and emotional and more prone to being a big whiny baby and if I'd just remembered to take them I'm 99% sure none of this would have happened but I'm so goddamn stupid and useless that I forgot and now everything's ruined due to my own fucking stupidity.

Anyway.  I came home and things are ruined, people who used to say I'm amazing and wonderful are now saying I'm a bad person.  Everything I thought I knew about myself and others and my relationships and friendships has been completely shattered.  I don't know or understand how people who truly cared about me could change their opinion in a heartbeat.  I don't understand how people who claimed to love and care about me can be so indifferent to the fact I was in the damn hospital having a nervous breakdown over this.  I'm entirely lost and confused and broken, I don't know what ever was real anymore because I just don't understand how someone can go from ""you're amazing"" to ""you're a bad person"" in the span of days.  I have a couple other people still telling me ""no, no, you're wonderful, anyone who knows you knows you're the kindest and most selfless person there is with a heart of gold, fuck anyone who says otherwise"" but I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions.  I know I shouldn't depend on other people so much to base my worth or my opinion of myself but I'm really a weak person with no self esteem so it's really sometimes the only way I can gauge what kind of person I feel like I am.  If that makes any sense at all.

I feel like I've lost so much.  People who meant so much to me.  Memories that I should be looking back on with fondness make me cry and panic and I get so scared and confused because I just don't understand.  Not just memories with the person in question but memories with ANYONE because it's like my whole sense of trust in people is gone.  I don't know what's real anymore.  I don't understand.  I've tried talking and doing everything I can to make it right and people refuse to listen.  I've been hurt so much by people and I always forgive because I understand that who we are when we're upset doesn't always reflect reality and what we actually think or feel, I know that saying things in the heat of the moment doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Being mean and hurtful in the heat of a fight doesn't always come from a place of calculated malice and mean you don't care.

I forgive and forgive and forgive and I've bore so fucking much lasting damage that my brain finally just snapped and broke and then I fuck up and everything is ruined.  It doesn't seem fair.  It doesn't seem right.  And I know that me forgiving someone doesn't mean they have to forgive me in return but I just...I don't understand.  I don't know how someone can go from saying I'm wonderful to saying I'm a bad person in a span of days.  It doesn't make sense and it has completely fucked with everything I thought I knew about everyone and every relationship I have.  I'm so scared and I feel like I can't trust a single person or anything they say anymore.

All I fucking wanted was friendship and company and I tried so hard and now I don't even know what's real anymore and I'm being told I'm a bad person...I've been crying and crying and crying so fucking hard for days on end, since I got home.  I keep having panic attack after panic attack and freaking out thinking I'm having a heart attack.  I can't handle this, I can't function.  I just want it to stop.  I just want it all to fucking stop.    I'm so fucking tired of feeling alone and worthless and useless and fragile and unlovable and broken.  I can't fucking take it anymore and I just need to make it stop.

I've had fights with people, including very close friends, before and it has never, EVER affected me like this.  I feel like my entire brain and sense of self and everything I thought I knew about every relationship I've ever had has been absolutely shattered and I don't know what to do.  I tried to talk and make it right and I get pushed away.  I just don't know what to do.

I was going to post this under a throwaway because some people know my Reddit account and I'm honestly scared I'm even going to be accused of attention seeking or trying to guilt them or something by posting about it but I can't even be bothered to, I'm so mentally and physically exhausted, my brain feels absolutely broken and I don't have the energy or will to do much of anything.  They already think I'm a bad person, who fucking cares.  I'm terrible.  I'm so sorry.

Update a few hours later:  thanks for the kind words everyone, they mean a lot to me but i really really can't do this right now.  i made everything worse and really ruined everything and i'm nothing but a huge joke to people i love and care about.  i'm weak and I'm stupid and i forget things and words come out wrong and I hurt people and I can never ever forgive myself.  I made an utter fool of myself in front of everyone and said horrible horrible things and I accidentally blabbed about something someone's extremely insecure about because I'm so stupid and forgetful and my brain is so foggy I straight up fucking forgot (not that they'd ever believe me regarding that).  I never once judged anyone and I always cared and loved everyone with all my heart, I'm just too much of a goddamn stupid broken mess to go about anything properly.  I hate myself, I hate my brain for betraying me and confusing me and upsetting me and making me act in ways I don't want to or mean to.  I take full responsibility because it's not an excuse but I hate it I HATE IT, I HATE that I hurt people and I really am a bad person and i'm so so sorry."
Be careful who you talk to,I’m a female who had an issue with suicide (still do) and who I thought was a friend came over to help me through it. All was good until he proceeded to force himself on me. He used my fragile mental state to take advantage of me. This happened over a week ago and he hasn’t spoken to me since. Be aware of who you speak to about this because I don’t want what happened to me to happen to someone else.
I wish I could trade places with someone who is dying and wants to live,"I feel like this is a super shitty thing to say and probably insensitive... I don’t have anyone to talk to that I can trust and I need to say it somewhere. I desperately want to trade places with someone who has COVID-19 or even like cancer or anything else, so they could get a second chance at life and my suffering could finally be over. I don’t want to be alive and haven’t since I was 11 or 12. It’s not fair that some people who are so full of life and happiness have to die while miserable people like me still exist. I’m a waste of resources and a drain on society. If I was given the opportunity to die in someone’s place I would jump at the chance. Not really looking for responses or anything... just had to put this out there and nobody in my life gives a shit how I feel."
just got raped a few hours ago. please someone talk to me before I slit my wrists.,its midnight and im sitting outside. I took a 3hour long shower and I still feel disgusting. I dont know this person. I was out jogging and he jumped me. Literally almost ripped my lip off. forced himself on me. im a 17 year old guy. I just need someone to call. i dont know what to do I feel awful.
McDonald's employee just saved my life.,"This is probably not the right subreddit, but whatever. I just needed to say this.

It was 4 AM. 

I was cold. I was lonely. I was tired. I was intoxicated. I was depressed. I was just about ready to finally put a bullet through the roof of my mouth.

But I hadn't eaten in three days, and I sure as hell wasn't dying on an empty stomach.

I stepped outside and lit a cigarette. It was going to be the last cigarette I would ever smoke.

I walked to my local McDonald's. It was the only place still open. It was completely empty. There was one employee left, manning the cash register.

I placed my order and pulled out my debit card.

""Sorry, the system's down, we're cash only for about 10 more minutes.""

I nodded and took a seat in a nearby booth. I could wait for 10 minutes.

I listened to the song on the radio. ""Just a couple more minutes,"" he said.

Another song went by. Then another, then another, then another, and another... 

He walked out, bag in hand, and handed it over to me. ""Don't worry about it,"" he said.

Confused, I walked to the cash register, debit card at the ready. ""So is it ready yet?""

""Don't worry about it.""

I was shocked. ""Thank you, sir.""

I walked out, returned home, and had the best, free, 5 dollar meal I've ever had in my entire life.

I won't kill myself tonight. Maybe I won't, ever. 

Thanks man.

My therapist said I had over 5 lives' worth of trauma packed into my 25 years. I don't think the bad times stop. I'm ready to go.,"Hi there. My name is Anna. I'm 25f. This post is going to be incoherent, because I can't really string my thoughts or sentences together anymore. I don't expect anyone to read this, and if you do, I'm sorry. 

 I've got a lot of mental health problems and it seems like every doctor diagnoses me with something different. 

The one person I told everything too is so tired. I love him very much, but I know caring about me is a burden. He needs more consistency, stability, and sustainability-- things I don't think I can offer with my brain.

I think this is a vent, but also the closest thing to a suicide now that I have. It's just the truth of my life, and why I'm ready for it to be over. 

I was raped at the ages of 4, 8, 14, 19 and 24, some of those years included multiple times. I've been kidnapped / sold. I've been a victim in a shooting. I've been forced to watch children die (murdered). I found my friend after he committed suicide when we were ten. I've been severely stalked. I watched my mother lose her battle with cancer. I've had friends murdered in college. I've been severely beaten. Hungry/starved. Homeless. There's been so much. And I'm so, so tired. 

If anything, I just want boring years where nothing happens, but I don't think that's possible. Everyone says the bad times don't last, that others have had it worse. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of hearing these things from people who don't have to live with my brain or experiences. People tell me I'm so strong but I feel so weak.  I don't want to fight to live. I don't want to survive anymore. I wouldn't even call this a crisis because I'm just so ready, so calm and numb.

If my guy sees this, I'm sorry I couldn't give you everything you needed. I'm sorry I couldn't get better.  Take care of the cats for me. I hope you find happiness, comfort, warmth and love. 💙💛 

See you, space cowboy."
i hate “it gets better”,"i was told that continually during my lowest points. but its only gotten so much worse. so much so that my lowest points now seem like my highest

sometimes it doesnt get better
i cant fucking stand this"
I am a ghost,I deleted everything. This is the only social media I'm still active on. Everything else is gone. I cut all ties. I haven't talked to freinds in days. I feel completely invisible. But I like it this way. I no longer have to make an ass of myself in front of loved ones. Maybe this is a better alternative to suicide... or maybe the first step.
"I’m 17 and my life is over..,","I was finally becoming happy. I had a job I loved, I was coming to terms with my family troubles and leaving them behind. I’ve made friends better than any I’ve ever had before and yet I am depressed. I used to think I was depressed an anxious the whole way though high school. I wasn’t depressed, I was sad. Maybe more than my friends yes, but not depressed. And I wasn’t anxious, I was just a nervous kid and I forced myself out of my comfort zone and overcame my nervousness. 

7 months ago, I got tinnitus. An incurable chronic condition which causes a ringing in my head. For 3 months I was coping with it. Until January. I began to develop hypercausis, a side effect of the condition. This side effect is extremely severe. It causes me to perceive normal sound as painful. I am unable to continue my passion of music and playing instruments and it makes everything else in my life almost unbearable. Around the same time I developed and anxiety disorder. My heart now constantly pounds in my chest and I have frequent panic attacks. 

I haven’t heard silence in 7 months, and I never will again.

My heart hasn’t stopped pounding for 4 months, and it never will again.

This is not living, this is coping.

All the positive thinking in the world isn’t going to cure me. Nothing will.

I have good friends and a family who care about me, but it doesn’t matter. None of it does."
Life is like a video game you don't want to play anymore or a book you don't want to read anymore.,The idea of suicide feels like pressing the pause/stop button on a video game. After sometime you just don't feel like playing the game anymore. You don't stop playing a video game or stop reading a book because of depression or loneliness. You stop simply because you don't wish to carry on. It could be because of boredom/repetitiveness. It could be because of the high difficulty. Of course you could start playing a different game or you could read a different book but can we do that in real life? Does anyone feel the same way?
I'm tired of trying,"On mobile so sorry about formatting

Like the title says. I'm sick of getting up everyday at the crack of dawn to go to a job that pays too little and get my ass chewed for 9 hours straight everyday. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Getting out of bed in the morning feels like climbing a mountain alone. Anything I try to do for entertainment is only a momentary release from this shithole we live in. I feel defeated. I use to have ambitions, goals, dreams. But now I can't even imagine a world where I can be happy. I don't want to continue on, working the same crappy job to go home to the same crappy parents that I can't move out from since I can't make enough money. I have no friends outside of work. Things look monochrome constantly. I don't know how much longer I can keep doing this."
Better. I am better.,"Just wanted to put it in writing. I played football today and studied well. I am meant to be dead but I stayed. Introduced meditation exercise and immense focus on my thoughts. 

This is a war but I am starting to win a lot more battles. I don’t see this as the end, but the beginning of something better."
My friend just shot himself in the head and we are left with nothing but questions and misery,There’s really nothing to say.  He had a beautiful five year old child and parents who cared about him and friends who are now very fucking pissed off.  This is bullshit.  I’m sitting here on reddit because there is nothing to do or say.  He was a great friend and the only person who didn’t criticize me or call me a coward for attempting suicide.  He would always say “me too bro.  It hurts every day”.  And now he’s gone.  Fuck you.
Did you ever realize?,"That nobody in your life actually gives a fuck about you? Not one person genuinely cares or makes an effort of any way towards your relationship or friendship? That while you’re sure they would cry if you killed yourself, they would soon get over it and move on, because despite the love and connection you feel towards them, nobody feels that way towards you? Despite the lengths you would go for anybody and everybody at all, nobody would so much as cross a shallow puddle to make you feel welcomed on this earth. 

Cause yeah folks, that sucks."
I didn't fucking ask to be here.,"This is what infuriates me. ""You can't kill yourself, think of how it will hurt your family."" I didn't fucking ask to be in this situation. If you had given me a choice, I would have said no thanks. Now because I had the misfortune of existing, I have to suffer through the rest of my life for other people? Fuck that. I love my family, in fact that's precisely why I hate life. Knowing my mom is going to die and everyone else I love is going to die. Life fucking blows. I would do anything to just cease existing."
Does anybody else feel like suicide is their inevitable destiny,"I've always felt that I'd never have to work a full time job or go through college because I have this constant, recurring feeling of fate that I'll eventually kill myself. anyone else have this feeling?"
"Thinking of killing myself comforts me because if everything gets too much to handle, I always have a choice to way out.","I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but lately I've been thinking about suicide a lot and it really makes me feel better that I can always make the choice when I want to. And that I don't need to deal with any consequences that come after, although it might sound selfish."
I feel like I lie and fake all my issues and I hate it,I feel like I make everything up and don’t truly have any issues or need any help
I just wish I could die a tragic death without me killing myself,A lot has gone wrong I’ll just leave it at that
Mom just basically told me to go to hell and she’s not listening to me anymore. Next time the house is free I am going to prepare me suicide method. This is it I’m finally taking the next step. What a fucking horrible way to treat someone you know is suicidal.,EDIT: A lot of comments are abusing my mom and saying to cut her off. She cares for me but she had left me crying and hadn’t literally said ‘go to hell’. I used that term perhaps colloquially and she basically told me that she isn’t sticking around to listen to me and stick around to hear me refuse to do anything. She merely left me alone in my room to hurt while she went to make dinner for my brother or whatever. I apologize to those who took it literally. Bad communication on my part
my mom attempted suicide today,"TW: kind of graphic description of suicide attempt 



so at around midnight on 5/31/18 i woke up to my brother coming into my room and screaming that our mom tried to kill herself and that she wasn’t breathing. i immediately got up and went outside, i went into the backyard and into the garage, where my step father was trying really hard to give her CPR. she tried to kill herself by hanging, she took an electrical cord and draped it over a hook on the ceiling, and wrapped it around her neck. thankfully because of how poor her attempt was, she wasn’t fully hanging off of the ground, and was mostly on the ground. we don’t know how long she was out there and we don’t know how long her airway had been cut off. anyway, as soon as my step father got her to start gasping for breath, the paramedics showed up and put an oxygen mask on her. they took her away into the ambulance and my brother, me, and my step father got ready to go to the hospital. eventually we ended up in the ER waiting for answers about my mom. they had first told us that she might have suffered significant brain damage and could end up brain dead. however, they took her to get a CT scan of her brain, and they then told us that they don’t see any significant damage to the brain, no swelling or bleeding, and her neck was not injured significantly. i’m so thankful that the damage that was done wasn’t worse. after the horrifying news we decided to wait to see her, talk to her a little, and then go home. when we were able to go see her i went in first. she was breathing so hard and she was in a coma. i don’t know how long her brain went without oxygen and i just really hope that she wakes up and can make even somewhat of a recovery. all we know as of right now (5:00 AM on 5/31/18) is that she is stable but in critical condition, and now we’re just waiting for her to wake up. i have a lot of thoughts going on in my head right now but mostly i just want her to wake up and not be a vegetable. the only thing i’m really worried about is the fact that she was drinking so much alcohol when she did it, and with her asthma and obesity she’s more at risk of complications.. you really don’t know how much you miss someone and realize how much better you should treat someone until something like this happens. i just wanted to vent about it because everyone is asleep now and i haven’t been able to even think about sleeping. i’m ending my vent here. i love you mom, please wake up.

"If you're upset about the election, the place to seek help is NOT by inviting discussion about it on the internet. Including here.","We know that the US election results are adding to the burden of fear and despair that many of you are carrying.  But this particular election has brought a lot of legitimate rage to the surface, and secondarily given others an excuse to unleash indiscriminate aggression against the most vulnerable people they can find.

We know that for some of you tonight might feel like the last straw.  It's completely understandable that you'd want help, but the wide-open internet is not the place to seek it right now.  Due to the amount of brigading, abuse, and argument they're attracting, we're taking down all political posts.  

Please seek mental-health support through true crisis resources, which we are not.  The sidebar/community info has links if you need them.

Life isn't a gift.,It's a burden rather.
I wish I could just snap my fingers and never wake up.,If I could restart my life I would..
Living with suicidal ideation is like having to put killing yourself on the bottom of your checklist for the day and hoping you don’t get everything done,"Like, I (F23) WANT to live. I want to be happy and normal (and I know people are like “there is no normal, we all get sad!” But since puberty I have heard voices, pulled out my hair, self harmed, been generally anxious and extremely emotional, and always suicidal). But my therapists and psychiatrists and parents and friends just tell me to make a list. I get overwhelmed easily and my brain immediately goes to “just die”—but they say making a list helps. So I try, and I put it on the bottom of my list everyday. For example, tomorrow:

-breakfast&coffee
-homework
-shower 
-clean
-work
-homework
-commit suicide

And if I get tired at any time, I just go to sleep and start over again. But dying is always at the end of my list. Its worked for me so far. I’m a great procrastinator, so just putting it off until the next day helps me survive. 

I know sometimes it seems death is grabbing you by the nostrils and screaming in your face to just do it, but I’m talking about just day to day life."
My 13 yo daughter overdosed on about 6 grams of Wellbutrin and 1500mg of Zoloft.,"I am trying so hard to make this right. She was airlifted to children’s hospital and now she’s laying in her hospital bed unresponsive and her muscles are jerking. 
This has been the scariest day of my life. That child is my entire world. She’s all I have. I have out my heart and soul into raising her. I never want to lose this little girl. 
But here I am. She’s about to be 14. She’s a little on the eccentric side, but she has a heart of gold. She’s never met a stranger. But ever since 8th grade has started, she has been getting bullied. And the teachers don’t really do anything about it. This was her way of coping. 
I went to wake her for school this morning and found her covered in vomit and she had been hallucinating and having seizures for hours probably. What if I hadn’t found her?
Why does she feel like this is the only way? I want to make all the bad go away. How do I do this? How do I help her cope? 
I didn’t know who to turn to, so I’m turning to reddit. Please help me understand how to help her. 

**UPDATE

My daughter is still in recovery but she’s come so far! We are no longer in ICU. We were moved to the special care unit which is a step down. 
She doesn’t remember anything. She doesn’t even remember school that day. She’s so upset that this happened. She said she doesn’t understand why and how she did it. 
She was hallucinating pretty bad over the last couple of days but that has subsided tremendously, if not completely. 
She’s still unable to determine if she’s in reality or if this is a dream.  And it’s heartbreaking to tell her this is reality, but this reality is way better than the one I thought I would have. 
I am the luckiest woman on earth.  "
anybody else feel permanently fucked up?,"even if i tried to get my shit together and put any effort into fixing my life, i’m already seriously behind and my brain doesn’t work right, which would just make it all even harder than it should be. trauma seems to have had a serious impact on my ability to do simple tasks, remember things, focus, or be a reliable person in general. it’s been a while since anything terrible has happened to me, and yet i’m still fucked in the head. i feel like it’s gonna be this way forever. why even try?"
"Today, I've reached one of the lowest points in my life. I hope you finish reading my post.","Hello. Right now, there are a lot of words that have stopped really reaching me for a while now. 

I'm still here. I can't afford to be gone. I am the pillar of other people. 

That's why, right now, when I'm at my weakest, I have to ask strangers to be MY pillar. I'm not really expecting much. I'm just hoping that somewhere, there's someone who's reading my thoughts and letting me be my vulnerable self. Maybe after you've read this post, maybe you could take half a minute to wish me better luck. I'm not religious, but you can also wish me blessings. At this point, I'd take anything. But for just reading this, I'd like to say thank you."

"
I fucked up my body and my life thinking I was transgender.,"Go into my post history for the full story. I'm too exhausted to type all of it back up.

TL;DR: I thought I was transgender, took testosterone injections for over a year, realized I was just a masculine/androgynous woman, dealing with the fallout.

I am now a woman with a deep-ish voice, horrible acne scars all over my back, thinning hair, an enlarged downstairs, profuse body hair, deformed breasts, and facial hair.

I feel like a fucking freak. It was a long, horrible road realizing I made a mistake and was not trans, but a road I drove down much too late. I can deal with most of it alright. Body hair can be shaved if I so desire to, I can raise my voice pitch through voice training, there are creams or whatever for the acne scarring. My thinning hair is actually regrowing since I stopped injections a few months ago.

But my genitals and breasts will never be the same. I can't remove my facial hair permanently without spending several hundred dollars (I am very broke.) I have permanently mutilated myself with these injections. Ironically, they were supposed to make me feel ""more aligned"" with who ""I truly am"" but for me, it was really just a desperate attempt to slap a bandaid on the gaping wound which is my body dysmorphia and deep rooted self image problems.

And to make matters even more delightful, there exist certain individuals who take my suffering and twist it to fit whatever political agenda suits them. Trans people hate me because they think I give them a bad name and discredit medical transition. Evangelicals and TERFs love me because they want to use me to discredit medical transition.

I don't want my pain to be misappropriated for someone else's vindicative internet posts. I don't want my story used to harm real trans people. 

I hate my stupid fucking deformed body and I just want to go back in time and kill my past self so that she never ever takes that first testosterone shot. Never has to feel this pain. It's abysmal staring myself down in the mirror every day. To see the effects this powerful drug has had on my poor body.

I have been suicidal for many years but lately I just feel something evil growing inside me, something which will give me the power to end my own life before my rational brain can talk me down. I have no job, I'm actually on the comedown of a terrible LSD trip, I'm a budding alcoholic and binge eater. No one will ever love me like this. Its not like I've got a great personality to make up for my physical flaws. I'm depressing and condescending without realizing it. 

The world would just be better off without people like me in it. I'm a fucking joke. To the kids out there questioning your gender: TALK TO A FUCKING THERAPIST FIRST. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. DON'T BE ME."
Bye ♡,"This is a goodbye to all of the people here, specially every one that I talked to.

You were all so kind and lovely to me. Thank you for each one of you that cared, that messaged me, that tried to help. You are all so nice. All of the things you wtote to me meant the world.
You made me feel better in bad moments and made me feel loved and real a lot of times. I'm really thankful.

To the kind and lovely people that I talk here, I love you all so much. You are so important to me. Thank you for making my days better and for giving me good moments. You made it easier for me to live here. 
I'm sorry that I couldn't tell bye to each of you, it would just worry you more. 
Just please, know that you matter the world and I want all of you to be happy.

If you are reading this, whoever you are, thank you, too. I know things are hard. I don't know your pain, but I know it will get better. Things change everytime, maybe for better. Don't give up on trying. 
You are all so, so strong. You will be fine. 

I hope you can feel fine and happier with time. I'm sending you a big hug and lots of love. Always remember that there's someone who cares. 

I'm sorry if I'm hurting you with this. I'll be fine now. I'll be in peace. I hope you can find peace here on earth. It just wasn't possible to me, but it can be to you.

I love you. Thank you for reading, if you did. ♡"

I'm 22 years old. I was happy for two years and really thought I was safe. It turns out, my best friend and the only person I ever trusted has been lying and cheating on me for two years. 

I'll never be good enough. The pain will never stop. I'll always be used. I attract pain. I'm too soft, to ready to be hurt. I'm small and the world is so sharp. 

I'm so tired of hurting. I have a plan. I'm waiting 24 hours."
I didn't kill myself thanks to this subreddit. <3 you guys,"9 days ago on Saturday, I decided to kill myself. Wanting to kill myself finally overpowered the knowledge of how much pain I would cause to my family and friends. I just woke up that morning and realised I could not take another fucking day. I was going to wait till my parents were asleep, than I was going to swallow an entire bottle of sleeping pills washed down with half a bottle of whisky. Funny thing was the knowledge that I was finally going to do it made it the best day in a while. 

I didn't do anything special. Same old shit. I even finished off a school assignment for some reason. I don't know why. Played Xbox. Went to gym. Went for a run. Talked to a few people on skype. Walked my dog. Had dinner. Dinner was weird, thinking it was my last meal. Said goodbye to my dog, told her I hoped other people would walk her when I was gone. Said goodnight to my parents for what I thought would be the last time. Hugged my grandma goodnight. Went to my room and locked the door. Decided to smoke some weed one last time. By then it was about 10:30 and I knew my parents were going to sleep at about 11:30 so I had some time to kill. Said I’ll give myself an hour to find a reason to not kill myself. Went to this subreddit. Read through all the top submissions and realised I had never tried to fight this. I had only accepted it as inevitable just a question of when. It helped that I was high as fuck but my inner monologue told me I was weak for choosing the easy way out and not giving fighting my depression a serious effort. Took 3 sleeping pills (my usual dose) and passed out. 

The next day was shit. Still as depressed as ever, still wanted to kill myself. But I legitimately tried to get better. And by the end of the day I had smiled without faking it for the first time in months. I felt happy for a little bit. And I realised that I would go months of being depressed in the hope of feeling like that again. It was just a simple thing, my dog licking me on the nose while I was listening to some music. In the days that followed things haven't improve much but I haven’t legitimately considered suicide since.  I’m determined to beat this one way or another. I’m debating not smoking weed for a few months and see if that helps or not. But whatever happens, you guys saved me from killing myself that night.


Much love. 
"
why are we only appreciated when we’re finally gone?,"for fucks sake, it bothers me how many people say such kind words at funerals of people who killed themselves. why couldn’t you say that when they were alive?? most of the time they felt so unloved they wanted to take their own life, because no one stopped to say that they appreciate them. that’s at least how i feel.

i don’t know if i believe in some kind of afterlife, whether it be heaven or living out a life as a ghost. but part of me wants to kill myself, just to be able to watch my own funeral. call me an attention whore, i get it. but god damn. how do people really feel about me? and how many people are faking it? i want to know if my father tells the truth when he says he couldn’t live without me. i want to know if my mother can finally say that she loves me at my own funeral. i wonder what kind of words my only two friends will say, and i want to see if they actually cared. if they actually were my friends. 

there’s so much i want to know, and all of it is basically craving to know that someone gives a shit. and if killing myself is the only way of giving myself a chance to see that, why shouldn’t i?"
"""99% of people regretted it!""","Please, I planned that overdose for so damn long. Even got myself an alibi! Enough to kill at least three people, but a family friend stopped by because they needed to use the bathroom on their way home and found me. Legit, when I was passing out, I have never been so happy, so relieved, that everything was finally going to be over. The first time I attempted, I was fourteen and I was so happy when I passed out and thought it was over. Every time, even.

Can you imagine how angry and disappointed I was this time when I woke up tied by the wrists and ankles to the hospital bed so I ""wasn't a danger to myself?"" For nearly three days I was kept strapped down and injected over and over and otherwise ignored because I was ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and all those words to describe someone who just REALLY REALLY REALLY wanted to die. Three weeks later in the psychiatric ward, most of it seclusion and some of it again restrained to the bed because I refused medication. It's easier to pacify someone who isn't given the right to function, I suppose. Now I'm back out on suicide watch.

I don't understand how someone can put people through shit like that ""for their own good."" Well, I guess it worked in a fucked up way. Now I want to die more than I've ever wanted to, but I'm so fucking terrified it's going to go wrong and I'll be locked up & left to rot tied to the bed again because I've been in the hospital so many times that they just don't know what to do with me. Why is it so hard to understand that death might just be the answer? I have NOT reached out for help, I've only tried to die on my own terms, and I get treated like a violent criminal. Do you know how terrifying it is to be incarcerated in a ""hospital"" against your will and being denied freedom and having an army of rough guys hold you down so they can force meds into you?

Why the fuck do people do this to other people? It's so much worse than dying, and now they've even taken away the last freedom I thought I had. I really don't want to live, but I'm too scared to try to die. I can't go through that again. Maybe 99&#37; of people regretted it, but for ten long years I've never once regretted it. They don't believe me, though. They just lock me up and throw me back out when they've given up or when I'm ""stable."" I'm not a person to them, I'm just cattle that comes in, gets processed and punished if I resist, and thrown back out. Nobody gives a fuck about me, and nobody does anything if I complain because every record tells how ""hysterical"" and ""dangerous"" and ""agitated"" and ""suicidal"" I am. No rights, no problems.

How is this okay? How is this the world I live in? How can I possibly want to live? Why am I put through all this just for trying to die?"
How come I can't choose suicide as an option? (serious),"Basically the title. Every time I or some one I know talks about suicide it's always an unacceptable choice that no one can ever make. Why?

I didn't ask to be here, I don't want to be here. Why do others get to dictate when I can go?

I understand trying to overcome depression and other mental illnesses that play into suicidal thoughts, but what if I'm sick of trying? Or I just don't care? Or I have tried and failed so many times that I feel it's hopeless?

I'm not trying to trigger anyone having these same thoughts, I just genuinely don't want to be alive. I find no joy, excitement or purpose in it and want it to be over. Why do I not get that choice?"
"Killing myself is a PERMANENT solution to a PERMANENT problem. Depression is a lifelong illness that cannot be cured, it can only be suppressed and treated.","I hate everything. I don't enjoy anything, I hate life, I hate my family. I have nothing I am good at or enjoy. No reason to live. nothing to strive for. Nothing to gain. I don't have any reason to live.

I don't love anything or anyone enough to stay. I just want to die and see what happens afterward, I have no obligation to live this life fully. And if there is nothing after death then that's great.

I have no goals for this life. At least my death will be a step in the right direction. Nobody will have to deal with me ever again."
I've been a hypocrite in this sub and I'm sorry,"I try to steer others away from suicide and yet, I'm no different. These thoughts just seem to stay in a state of temporary stasis and randomly decide to manifest themselves whenever they feel like it. 

There's a hidden urge to simply hit the eject button in the midst of this all. Everything and nothing begin to lose their value and meaning altogether. Undoing myself would bring upon a much more needed comfort because my comfort doesn't truly seem to lie in this life.

Conversely, if I want to stay alive… I hesitate. I think it over a lot. It works because I am not dead yet. I think therefore I am alive."
Bye r/suicidewatch. I’m getting. Therapy.,My mom saw my cuts and now I’m gonna get therapy. I got help accidentally. Yay I guess? I hope all of you get the help you need.
I just die inside when my parents mention things I will do in the future even though I have no intention on living that far...,"Like when my parents say “when you finish university” “when you get a job” “when you get a girlfriend” “when you’re my age” 

Shit hurts cuz I don’t plan on living that long. "
"I have sexual thoughts about kids. I'm 26. Please don't hate me, I already hate myself more than you ever will.","I wasn't always this way.  But sometime around 2011, I began to notice that I felt certain urges and thoughts when near prepubescent children.  They aren't urges to hurt them or, god forbid, do *that* to them...but I would sometimes imagine them naked and using the toilet.

That sounds really strange, and this requires some backstory on me: since my teens, I've been aroused by images of people going to the bathroom (don't ask why, who the hell knows).  It mostly pertained to people my age...but then I accidentally came across a kid (Google Image, I don't go to any...*sites*, good lord) and found myself equally aroused.  I was horrified.

I know this is really, really gross and sick, I know.  It's happening more and more often, these thoughts.  I had a therapist who knew, but when she moved away, I had no one.  Trust me, it takes months or even *years* to build up that kind of trust for me.  I can't even say the...word...itself because I am so sickened by how I think sometimes.

Believe me: you cannot hate me more than I hate myself.  I nearly attempted suicide twice in college and it was a big part of my rationale for truly attempting suicide in March.  Please, please, just...be kind.  That's all I want.  I've never felt more alone."
"Hey suicide watch family, im just checking in :)","The homeless shelter has been going very nicely, this new city I'm staying in has many kind donators who keep us fed and clothed.



The shelter assigned me a case manager that will help me stay on track and focused toward getting on my feet and helping me get my own apartment.


Ive met some very interesting people, and they all have been very friendly towards me so far.
We all like to hangout and chit chat in this garden and also watch Court cases together :p


Love love love you guys.
"
You know your life is an absolute wreck when you casually debate in your head whether you should go to college or commit suicide instead.,"This is really the state of my life right now. Applied, got accepted, and getting ready to finalize everything. College starts in a month and I still haven't chosen yet. With each passing day, the latter seems more and more appealing."
"Just tried, my cat saved me","My hair's soaked and I put away the razor. Was in the tub cutting myself to end it all, door was closed but my cat got in and meowed at me and wouldn't leave. Got out of the tub and in bed cuddling with him. He saved me, but I wish he hadn't. But I'm safe for now I guess"
I wish killing yourself was easy.,"Like just pop one pill, feel no pain, fall asleep and never wake up. 

I really wish it was that easy."
On the verge of giving up,"I am being harassed and the legal system is set up to protect the people harassing me more than me. I keep begging the police for help and  they seem sympathetic but tell me that they can't do anything since I am not being threatened. I just lost one of my jobs over this and have no idea what I am going to do. There is no justice in the justice system.

I am going broke from legal fees, bills, and unexpected expenses. The job I lost was only part-time but that $400 a month matters. My ex destroyed my credit so I can't even rely on that. My electric is going to get shut off because the equal pay plan ended and I don't have the money to pay the rest of the bill.

I have a vet bill that needs to be paid because my cumstain of an ex never paid it and I moved so I didn't get the bill. My cat is epileptic and takes medication. She has to get bloodwork every year and I don't know how I am going to afford both the old bill and the new one. I'm so fucking useless that I can't even properly take care of my cat.

I have a new boyfriend but I'm having trouble enjoying it. He reached out to play with my hair yesterday and I flinched so obviously that he pulled back. He told me it's okay, he understands, and even apologized to me for scaring me. *He* apologized to *me* like he did something wrong. I'm the one that's so broken that I pull away from kindness. He deserves so much better than what I can offer.

I am exhausted to the bone. I'm averaging 3 hours of sleep a night and it's interrupted by nightmares. Every noise sends me into a panic and I feel too vulnerable to sleep with headphones on.

My anxiety is so high that it has  reached the stratosphere. I can't leave my apartment alone without feeling like the ground is going to give way. I can only go out when I am with someone and I just feel so goddamn pathetic asking people to come with me to the store. The panic attacks are brutal and I find myself hoping one will just give me a heart attack and be done with it.

I'm just so fucking tired of fighting and getting nowhere. Every time I think things are getting better, something happens and they get worse."
I would like to dedicate this to the memory of all the people /r/SuicideWatch and /r/Depression have lost over the years.,"Many nights, as I am laying in bed, I think about you lot and all those we have lost. I think about the posts I have read on here, of those I have replied to and those who came here to say goodbye. I remember and I wonder, did she walk off into the woods that night to overdose in peace, did he hang himself in his basement, did he jump from the top of those offices and did she walk away into the cold to never be seen again? Did these people go through with it or where they persuaded otherwise, did they succeed and did they find the peace and release they wanted?

For the most part, we rarely learn your names, we are usually only left to remember your reddit username and even then, this is one of the only things we know about you. I will be honest, I do not actually remember your usernames for I see so many everyday but I do remember you guys. I think about you often and I just hope that you did find the peace you went to seek. I hope that you found what you were looking for, or something better. If you are still with us, I hope you found that epiphany instead, the one so many of us are fortunate enough to have, and I hope you learned what you have to live for.

But for those of you who came here to say goodbye, I do respect you all so much. In reading your words, I am pleased to know that you had thought it through and though you were wanting to end the pain, you did it for the happiness that peace would bring - you knew what you were doing and truly wanted it and were not just doing it out of desperation on the instance of of a thought.

I just want you guys to know that, though we may not know, or remember, your names, we do think of you often. You are remembered by those that did not know you and truly missed by those who did. You were remembered and all of you always will be. Good luck to everyone reading this and to the memories of those who no longer can. See you in another life, brother.

This is for those who helped to save others. This is for those who could not be saved. This is for those who may need saving. This is for those who are reading this. This is for those who are not. This is for those who no longer can. This is for you. See you in another life, brother."
“If only they would have reached out” = Pure bullshit,"  

I see it all over the news in these ‘mental health campaigns’, some celebrity going on about how depressed people just need to talk about it. I can already picture people i know saying after my death, “if only he would have reached out”, “if only he would have talked about it”. This is fucking bullshit and they can all fuck right off. I reached out, I tried to talk to so many of you so many times, but you gave me nothing back, NOTHING! You can only reach out or talk, if people are willing to listen and people are not. 

I have always been told that i don't smile much, like it was an accusation. No-one ever bothered to ask if i was okay. I wish the transition from life-to-death was a bit easier. It's not nice to know my last moments will be filled with instinct driven panic and regret. I just want it all to stop. I need it to stop. I'm tired."
Do you guys ever wish that there was a simple button that would give you instant and painless death when you press it?,"If there was such a button, I would have pressed it long time ago..."
Existing is exhausting.,"  I'm so tired of waking up, day in, day out. Seeing the sun doesn't make feel grateful or energized for the next ""bright new day"". It doesn't make me think of fresh starts and ""every moment is a chance to turn it all around"". 
  Everytime I see the sun, I just feel my whole being shrink away. It's too bright and somehow makes an already overstimulating world, louder and faster.
 Like a sick animal, I just want to find a quiet hole to crawl away into and die; isolated from everything and everyone around me. 
  I only exist for my sister's sake but there's no way to exist for myself as well. I am a worthless, useless and pathetic excuse for a 30 year old human being with nothing to offer anyone. 

I'm so tired of being alive. I just want the noise in my head to stop."
Why can't there be an easy and peaceful way to die?,"I've wanted to kill myself for a while now, but I'm afraid of suffering or being in a panicked situation even if it's only for the brief moment. Why are the only options inhumane methods? It's so stupid that society is against assisted suicide, especially because what's the harm with it? Some might say it's unethical, well it's also unethical to force someone to kill themselves inhumanely... I hate this. "
“I’m always here if you need to talk”,"I appreciate the programmed sentence you feel obligated to tell me, so you can feel better about yourself. 

The reality is, so many people can you tell you there here for you - but they’re not, I’m sorry but they’re not. 

I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone “hey they’re back, the thoughts are back and they’re stronger each time” 

I couldn’t even tell my therapist the truth depth, I can tell her I have thoughts sure, that they linger - always. If I tel her, I get “you’re not going to though, right” - it feels like a trick question. What relieves them though? I meditate, I journal, I do yoga, I exercise, I have lovely friends and family, I take my meds, I drink water - but they’re there. 

When does it end?"
...,"Feeling unappreciated. 
Like people won’t accept me for who I am. 
That I’m uninteresting and a burden.

I’m tired of acting happy.
I’m tired of living.
I want to leave... but fear stops me.

I don’t want to hurt my family.
I don’t get treated well.
Emotions hold me back.

Nothing excites me.
My future ambitions are gone.
I love sleeping because it’s the closest thing to death.
 
I’ve started working out, eating healthier.
A lot of things I want are given to me.
I’m thankful for all of it, but that won’t save me.

I just want love.
From anyone. 
A family member, perhaps a friend or stranger.

But I feel that even if I find love it won’t be enough.
When will I ever be satisfied?
I guess I’m stuck here until natural events are the end of me..."

My experience with “reaching out”.,"Ppl: “People need to reach out when they’re feeling suicidal. There’s help available out there. You matter!”

The suicide hotline saved my life last night,I was very nervous about calling but I don't regret it at all. Amazing resource
"We euthanize pets when we think they have no more quality of life left and it’s deemed the “responsible” thing to do. But when a human knows their life and that they have no hope left, suddenly everyone becomes the expert on “suicide is selfish and there’s a chance things will get better”",I don’t want to live out the next 50-60 years of my natural lifespan in pain waiting for the day to come so I just want to take matters into my own hands now and save myself the suffering. I don’t need judged and told to hold on because things “might” improve. My life has had 17 years in it. Plenty of time to live it and know it’s never going to get any better. If things were ever going to get better and my life was going to improve then it would’ve happened by now
"My girlfriend committed suicide, and I'm worried I'll end up doing the same","My girlfriend of over 5 years committed suicide a few days ago, and I feel like I'm fucking dying inside. On one hand, I feel so much emotional pain that it's killing me, but on the other hand, I also feel so numb and empty and lost. I can't process it.

I wanted to propose to her. The worst part is that the reason she did it was because she was being sexually abused by a ""friend"" of mine for years, but kept it a secret from everyone because she was being blackmailed by him. 

I feel like it's my fault. I should have realised. I should have stopped it from happening. I can't believe I let that piece of shit anywhere near her. I feel so much guilt that it's driving me crazy.

My head is a mess. I haven't left the house for days. I haven't spoken to anyone. I've been ignoring all the phone calls and text messages from my family and friends because I can't bear talking about it because I don't want to acknowledge that it's reality. I haven't opened the door to anyone who's tried to come and visit me.

I can't sleep properly, I've practically been starving myself. I just keep thinking that I wanna die. In the shower, I wanna drown. In the kitchen, I wanna take a knife and just end it. I can't take this feeling. I just want her back, I love her so much, and I don't know what I'm going to do without her.

I hate everything right now. And that evil fucking son of a bitch is probably gonna get off free and not even gonna go to prison because I don't have any good evidence. 

Everything's just a mess, and I feel like I'm not fully in control of my own actions at the moment. I don't want my family to find me dead, but I feel like it's what's gonna end up happening if I can't get my shit together. Sorry for the long post "
It’s just sad because the only thing I see in my future is eventually killing myself.,"I am just imagining doing it now. It sounds so nice, peaceful. I just want things to be quiet. Somewhere beautiful. 


I won’t kill myself today, and not tomorrow.
I know that killing myself means hurting my family. I’ve seen how suicides affect people. 


But I’m in so much pain. I’m 4 days clean from cutting. The mental and physical pain are so much sometimes.

Anytime I’m feeling something other than sadness or depression I know it will fade.
I feel like i see the world for what it is when I’m depressed. I’m more creative when I can think.


Idk I’m just kind of ranting.
You guys don’t need to send me to someone to talk. I’m okay. Today’s my first day of being on a new antidepressant so eventually I will get better.
I am seeing a psychologist though I think I need to talk more often to them."
Must feel amazing to not want to kill yourself at least 5 times a day.,"I don't even remember what a normal life feels like after starting this beautiful depressive journey in October 2017. Some of you are so unbelievably strong that you are still here after eternities of pain.

&#x200B;

Also blows my mind that there are people out there who don't want to kill themselves at least 5 times a day.

rough life, eh? "
On having no friends in your 20s,"The schedule is always the same: you work 55 hours each week and work out 15 more. You eat takeout at your desk. You stare – blankly – at others from whom you feel depersonalized and disassociated. They stare back. They glare back. They retch and recoil. You go home and eat more takeout and stare some more – at the wall, at the ceiling, out the window. You watch the world turn. You regret. You speak to yourself and diagnose yourself and add and subtract and divide and grind your teeth and lament and-

Nothing changes. You stare down and seek reprieve in the rug. You hug your knees and smoke a hundred cigarettes. You exercise again and read a little. You return to work and lie about your weekend plans and your mental health. You hope and dash those hopes. You wait and pray. You shower too long. You eat too little. You never sleep.

You resolve. You plot. You choose the tools. You cradle them and know you can end it in minutes. You cower and retreat, and it comes in waves and you attempt again but flee again too. You cannot tell anyone. You cannot hug anyone. There’s no one to hug.

Your parents and grandparents age. They inquire ceaselessly after your condition. You lie again. You say things are fine, the social life survives, you enjoy work. You enjoy nothing. You drink. You smoke. You masturbate. You cry some more.

Nothing changes. Spring fills fragrant the air and summer brings its heavy trod. The autumn wind bites and the weeks stretch on. The days grow longer then shorter again. The walk is the same. The work is the same. The nights are the same. The sun and moon and stars and horizon are the same. You are the same.

Nothing changes."
stop trying to fucking guilt trip me,"*“your family will be so distraught if you hurt yourself!!!”*

*”you have NO IDEA how much of an impact suicide will have on those around you!”*

*“imagine the reaction of your parents! imagine them reading the note! receiving the call!”*


....



wtf,,,, i know you have good intentions but *please*

is this really supposed to make me feel better? 

all it does is fill me with guilt,,, and fills me with the realization that i have to live in fucking pain until the day i die,,, or until everyone who “cares about me” will die."
I understand suicide,"I'm starting to understand people who commit suicide. It's like, when you know you have the rest of your life to look forward to but you look at your life and just can't imagine living it every day, year after year. You have people tell you it gets better but it's been years and it hasn't so it probably won't and you're tired...so tired. You just don't want to fight through the day anymore. I think when you commit suicide it's with the knowledge that there will be people hurting once you're gone but the idea that your pain will end may make it seem worth it. Suicide is indeed selfish but, perhaps for some, they have to be selfish because for years they put everyone else first. Always gave and gave and gave and no one bothered to see how they were...how they were managing...if they were ok. Maybe they were sucked dry by life and just couldn't take it anymore. For some, life is fleeting and they live it to its fullest...they enjoy it and love it...but for others...its so long...never-ending...painful. Being alive and living are two different things. Maybe some people who commit suicide actually died a long time ago but the people in their lives were so busy taking, they couldn't give a minute to realize. Death is funny like that; it's not always on a physical level. 

I have struggled with my depression the majority of my life. While those I care about thought I've gotten better, the reality is, I've just gotten better at hiding it. There are nights that I lie awake dreading waking up, living the day that just ended again, over and over. It's a cycle that never ends...nothing ever changes. Nothing good is sustained. Life just continues tomorrow exactly the same as it was today. Every bad decision plagues me and losses I've suffered haunt my thoughts. On the rare occasion I attempt to reach out, I know I will mostly be met with half hearted attempts to listen or understand. There is usually only a distracted silence on the other end of the line. 

Night before last, while lying awake, I realized I understood people who committed suicide. That scared me. I am in a dark place and I have never felt more alone in my life. This is a time where I could have used the most support. At this time I no longer feel capable of maintaining relationships. It's taking so much effort and I need to put everything I have left into my children. They have to be my primary focus and I'm just not sure I have enough in me to be a good mom and daughter/sister etc."
Why are ''I'm gonna live''-announcements allowed here?,"This post is not meant to target anyone in specific, I see this really often in this subreddit, and it just got me so upset. People who come to announce here ''fuck depression, I have decided to live'' or ''I'm leaving this subreddit because I'm better now'' get the most karma and thus, visibility, although here are posts HOURLY about how someone's gonna do it, or needs someone to talk with. Who am I to say about who needs more attention, but in my opinion, it's the people who are struggling.  
Also, maybe it's just me, but these ''positive'' posts make me wanna kill myself even more. This makes me sound like a bitter piece of shit, and maybe I am just that. These ''uplifting'' posts are probably meant to be motivating and so on, but I just can't see or feel it. So please don't get me wrong, I wish everyone could live without suicidal thoughts, I wish everyone well, I wish no one felt the need to be in this subreddit. It's just really, really hard to feel happy for those who ''just decided to live'', when I've been fighting my suicidal thoughts over half of my life, and know it's not gonna get better before I'm finally dead.  
I'm sorry if I got anyone upset with this, that wasn't my intention. I wish I could die already, and not be such a whiny nuisance."
So the suicide hotline just hung up on me. Twice.,"I have no one. Having a breakdown. Called them for the first time ever. Apparently I wasn't suicidal enough. Fuck me, right?"
Suicide Hotline hung up on me,I told them everything that was happening and that I don't want to go on and they said sorry we couldnt help you and disconnected. Are you fucking KIDDING ME? Like I was placing an order at Taco Bell. I feel like they answered my problem right there. It's a good thing I don't have my pistol. Fuckin hell. How can you claim to help anyone suicidal with resources that can't help people? Now I want to run headfirst into traffic. 
This sandwich doesn't taste good.,"It doesn't. Bizarre as it is, this sandwich just doesn't taste good. It doesn't really taste like anything at all. It should, though. It's got bologna and salami and mustard and cheese and mayo (well, miracle whip actually. I'm a heathen of sandwiches). Tons of flavor. I used to love this sandwich, and I'd eat it while doing things I loved to do. It was my gaming sandwich, my movie watching sandwich, my writing sandwich, my singing sandwich. I think the only thing I never used this sandwich for was foreplay. Mustard stains on the sheets would kill the mood.  


Probably should post this on my throwaway account but...meh?   


I guess it's not just the sandwich. On my other monitor, I'm rewatching Dragonball Z for the umpteenth time. Majin Buu is paused, looking like an idiot. I love Dragonball Z. Watching it is supposed to make me happy. Same with everything else I've tried watching for the past two days...West Wing, Pacific Rim, Jurassic Park, Freakazoid. Temporary distractions, which is good, but ultimately they just aren't giving me any pleasure anymore. Nothing is.  


I'm so exhausted. I've been exhausted for weeks. But sleeping is terrible. All I do is lie there and think about people I've hurt, friends I've lost due to ways I've treated them. There is no atonement when they don't even speak to you anymore. I catch glimpses of them -- accidental Snapchat stories and things like that. I look back on old photos we had and video chats still saved so I can hear them talk to me again. It's a common fallacy in the world that somehow ""taking responsibility"" for your actions makes everything okay. I almost wish I was ignorant to my own wrongdoings -- right now, I'm just furious and guilty and there's nothing I can do about it. So I lie there, listening to white noise or comforting ASMR videos to try and keep my brain at bay. Usually though, I'll end up lulling myself to sleep thinking about the different paths of communication after my death. Who will get contacted first, based on which methods and which scenarios? How will certain outliers in my social circle find out? Who will be mad, who will be devastated?  


I never intended on posting to this subreddit. I've lurked here many times when I was feeling suicidal, and I'm not exactly sure why. Reading about other peoples' suicidal ideations is certainly no way to make myself feel any better. And typically, I'd actually feel worse for being in my mental state when I'd read other peoples' stories. Stories of abuse, abandonment, mistreatment. The worst the world has to dish out, that's what would send people to this dark place in their dark times. Me? I'm just...weak, I guess.  


I've been fighting off my own death since I was 14-ish. I've attempted suicide a handful of times already. I was a cutter as a teenager, then I moved to more drastic attempts. Had to be talked down from an overpass once. My most recent flirtation with death was an intentional overdose on my Klonopin prescription, March 2017. That was the closest I've gotten to death. Right after I did it, I called my mom. I wanted to die but...I was still scared. I was sobbing on the phone. When she realized what I'd done, she got the paramedics to my apartment. By the time they arrived, they had to break in my door. I'd lost motor function. I vaguely remember the phone call, and I vaguely remember waking up in the hospital.  


Anyway. This sandwich doesn't taste good. Life has lost its flavor, and I'm exhausted from going rounds with myself year after year.  


In November 2017, my life broke down. Hard. I had been living on my own, in Vegas. I had a great job with a great company, making decent money. It was stressful, hell yeah, and in a micro-view I was unhappy. But if I looked at things in a macro sense, I was doing great. I had a dog and a ton of close friends and even though at that immediate point in time I was working bananas hours, I was hopefully working towards a new promotion. I had goals. I was really trying. I was seeing my primary physician, my psych, and a weekly therapist. Everybody was on board with my mental health. I was diligently taking a new batch of prescriptions that seemed to be working. My therapist and I were several months into the process and I felt comfortable talking to her. I was playing by the rules and life was supposed to work out.  


So, then it all just went poof. I broke down. Stopped going to work. Stopped talking to anyone. Just, abruptly, one day. Didn't show up, didn't call. My brain led a savage counterattack, like it was actually demanding retribution for my happiness. I hid in bed for a few days and then randomly drove out of the state, posting nonsense to Facebook. Eventually my closest friend finally got through to me and talked me into coming home. I returned, but nothing changed. I lost my dog, gave him away to someone who could take better care of him than I could. I went to be with my parents in Ohio to try and sort myself out. Stayed there for about a month. Visited family. Tried to re-center myself. Same closest friend flew out on her own vacation time and helped me make the drive back to Vegas in January.  


Got back to Vegas. Walked into my apartment and I realized -- absolutely nothing had changed. I was still jobless, and most of my friends were mad at my abandonment. And that's not to paint them in a bad light -- not at all. I'm saying, these friends had been previously literally knocking on my door and getting ignored. Calling, texting, trying to reach me, and I'd blown them off. Their frustration with me was out of a place of self-preservation. You can't help someone who won't help themselves.  


And that's exactly what happened. All through January, I stayed holed up in my apartment. I burned through most of my savings, just ordering disgusting amounts of delivery food every night. I neglected my bills. I didn't care, at all. I let my living space turn into absolute filth and waited without emotion for the day to come when I was evicted and had to live, and eventually die, homeless and alone. It was fine by me. I just...I felt like I had been switched off. Whatever drive and instincts had previously kept me going were severed and I was just drifting along the current until I washed up on some metaphorical beach and died.  


Lots of other weird stuff happened during that period. I insulted people, I hurt people, I did things I regret. I think I may have caused that close friend's cat to die. I had some sort of other person or personality ""take the wheel"" for a few days. It's all kind of a blur.  


But eventually that same closest friend showed up at my door and refused to leave. Eventually she got me to open the door, and basically forcibly dragged me out. She took me hiking. I saw sunlight for the first time in a long time. I had real face-to-face conversation and then we had lunch, something other than Chinese or Dominos delivery. We got back to my apartment and she spent a couple hours with me cleaning the place up. Dozens of garbage bags, filled with old boxes and rotted food, and all of the old toys and mementos of my dog that I'd still been holding onto out of denial. We wiped down counters and started laundry, vacuumed and straightened. She took me to the grocery, bought me real food with actual nutrients. She did a one-woman barn raising.  


She left, and the message was clear: \*you have people who love you, but you have to help us help you\*.  


I didn't.  


In no time at all, I was just as withdrawn as before. Even being slapped in the face by compassion wasn't enough to kick-start my desire to live, to fight, to survive.   


My father showed up one day. I let him in. We started packing my belongings. The movers showed up. We sold my truck. I tried to hold my head high as I said goodbye to my friends one last time.  


""We'll see you in a few months dude.""  


""It's just a temporary thing. You just need some time to figure yourself out.""  


I knew it was lies. I knew even then, I wouldn't see these people again. I really did love them all, they'd been my friends for years and years and years, through times very similar to this one. But I knew this was different. It felt different. Because it didn't feel at all.  


I drove back to Ohio with my dad, and I did my best to make it a fun roadtrip for him. My mind was swimming and I really didn't remotely care about taking a road trip, but I knew he was excited so I tried to fake it for him. When we finally got to the house, I hugged my mom. She was so happy to see me. So relieved. It's got to be absolutely unbearable when your child is two thousand miles away and sick in a way that you can't help. I took my suitcase upstairs, and sat on my childhood bed.  


And I sobbed. I sobbed tears that hadn't wanted to come out for months. This was supposed to be a way for me to start over, but I knew deep in my core that it was the end. I looked at the four walls of the bedroom of my youth, and knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was already dead.  


That was early March. Here we are, nearing the middle of July. I still tried, to be honest. I tried, despite having no desire to do so. I tried to find solace in my family and I tried to rekindle my love for music. I joined a band. I started posting my own solo projects online. The band thinks I'm great, and the solo stuff I've posted to /r/makinghiphop has gotten pretty positive reviews so far.  


And none of that matters.  


I've never thought to myself ""the world would be a better place without me"". No, I'm fully aware that I bring joy and light into peoples' lives. I'm funny. I'm talented. I'm smart. I'm not half bad looking, either, when I take care of myself. Honest, I know all of that. I just...I don't \*care\*. I'm so exhausted. I'm so done. It's going to be in the next day or so. There are train tracks not too far from my house...I'm just going to park nearby, and start walking along until I can hitch a face-first ride to the afterlife. I can't fight anymore. I can't keep living life where I cry so often, and feel so empty and so guilty. I can't just sit here in my parents' house with no job and no purpose. I'm exhausted. I'm all out of fight.  


This sandwich doesn't taste good."
"I want to kill myself so I don’t have to work, I have a hard time keeping jobs..","Hello, past a year or two I been having a hard time keeping a job. I just ether don’t like the job, the people there, I feel like I’m always doing something wrong, I hate waking up and wasting my whole day there.

I don’t care about money like really I rather live on the streets or just be dead but my parents keep telling me the same stuff over and over, saying how “Everyone hates working” or “what do you expect to do in life, just sit in our house forever doing nothing” or “that’s life for you, man up stop acting like a kid your a adult now”..
I have a job right now, but honestly I just want to quit.
I managed to keep this job for 3 months but I don’t know what I’m gonna do,All I think about is I’m
going have to work everyday of my life and I have a hard time making it thru one day.. A day feels like for ever, idk everyday it feels like Its my last day.
I just hate living since I can’t function like a normal person for some reason it seems like everyone is able to do everything better then me and I’m just a mistake..
I’m on antidepressants they helped me to get the job I mentioned and probably why I stayed so long but there not helping much I think my depression got worst but idk..

So for rambling I’m just so lost right now in life.. I’m 19 btw"
Nobody fucking cares before you have actually done it,"but then, it's too late to care anyways. Care for one fucking time, ignorant dicks"
"Warning:  ""Suicide methods"" PM Troll is active at SW.  ","
##Edit:  June 11, 2012:  We're getting reports of reddit user loosepanda22 sending PMs inviting people to his pro-suicide subreddit.  Please report any occurrences to us using the link at right.  Thanks!##

If you get a PM that looks ""official"", encourages you to avoid suicide hotlines, and links to ""painless"" suicide methods, please use the link at right or **[click here to message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch)**.  Please **include the reddit account** that the PM came from.  

This person is trying to undermine our mission by **randomly and indiscriminately** targeting our OPs with PMs that appear to come from us at SW,  sound compassionate, and seem factual on the surface.  Their true goal is to make suicide seem safe and painless, and make seeking help seem difficult and dangerous.  
*****
**If you get one of these PMs, remember that the troll has no interest in helping you.       
He's** ***using you*** **to target /r/SuicideWatch.**
*****

Despite what the PMs claim, please be assured of the following:

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past, but in all cases the OPs were either located by the resourceful use of standard internet search methods, or were traced by someone other than the SW moderators.

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, but it's rare and is  unlikely unless you are uncooperative with the hotline responders.  The troll claims that a simple admission of suicidal feelings is enough to trigger police intervention and involuntary confinement.  This is completely false.   A rescue will only be initiated when the caller is at *immediate* risk for suicide, and is either unable or unwilling to agree to a safety plan.   Suicide hotlines are the best help that's out there, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the doctrine of *informed consent* applies to suicide hotline callers.  That means that callers have a right to know the hotline's policy regarding confidentiality, and their criteria for breaking confidentiality.    Callers are entitled to know this information before they disclose anything.  However, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation, as one of the highest risk factors for suicide is a sense of being a burden.  Please be assured that according to the [actual experts](http://books.google.com/books?id=RSt4hnnKoWkC), the only thing a person struggling with suicidal thoughts can do to significantly reduce their loved ones' suffering is to get some real help.

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook, which the PM links to, explicitly states that **anyone struggling with depression should not be exposed to this material**.  

It's very important that you report any PMs of this nature.  Please also report and downvote any comments which claim responsibility for the PMs, or defend the troll's actions.  "
Not today,"I talked to her. She doesn't want me anymore. She said she wants ETERNAL PEACE. Was planning to give her that kind of peace. I talked to her mom, who I considered a mother.  She tried to talk me out of it. I still drove to the mountains and was planning to drive the car to a cliff. Someone called me, a friend. She asked how my day went and I cried and told him everything.... I just came home from the mountains... not today.."
Holy shit dude i remember thinking how bizarre the idea of suicide was back when i was a kid and now im here longing it more than ever :/,For me being suicidal feels too normal now if im not suicidal i find ways to make myself fall back again This is plain awful
It is hard having no friends,Everyday I wake up to remember the crushing fact that I have no friends and will forever be alone. My social anxiety prevents me from getting friends or a girlfriend and it fucking sucks.
I just tried to call a couple of suicide prevention hotlines,"And they were so busy that I was placed on hold, or asked to leave a message for a call back.

I have been seriously planning to kill myself today - I have enough sedatives for a lethal dose, and I’ve had a bottle of wine to myself genuinely planning to eat the lot, but I’ve been fighting the urge all day and I finally tried to call someone.

The fact that the lines were so busy made me realise I’m not alone - there must be countless people trying to call my country’s helplines and somehow it’s oddly comforting to know that the reason I can’t get through to someone is because so many other people are right on the edge.

I’ll keep trying to get through because I need someone to tell me I have a reason to keep living, but I just wanted to say that it was eye opening to realise so many people are in the same situation. 

It’s not like resenting people being in front of the queue at the supermarket. There may be someone out there with their wrists open and bleeding out, whilst I am just very close to acting. Who am I to take their place in the queue?

I guess it’s just strangely helpful to know that there are so many people feeling the same way I do.

Love and well wishes to anyone reading this.  "
My new year's resolution is to work up the courage to commit suicide,27/male/worthless

But after 3 suicide attempts, 4 psychiatrists, 2 weeks in hospital, and four different mental health diagnoses (and that’s just over the last year) I am finally doing well and would consider myself healthy.

They found him,"My ex boyfriend of 5 years and best friend of 6 killed himself about a week ago and they just found his body in the woods. I feel like everything I touch dies, this is my third friend who has killed themselves. I can’t even begin to figure out how to process this. I’d used to call him on my bad nights and he’d talk me down and he promised he’d be here and alive as long as I was. I feel like it’s my fault, I feel such an immense amount of guilt for neglecting him in his final week, almost taunting him. I can’t stop crying unless I turn back to substances but I know he wouldn’t want it like this. I can’t help. Those five fucking words destroyed me.

Edit: Wow... shocked to see how many people feel the same way I do. Just wanted to say thanks for all the replies and kind words"
I feel guilty for thinking about suicide due to the pandemic,"I just want to die i want everything to be over with. i’m not doing my online classes , i’m not doing any of my school work. i’m going to fail and have to retake the year all because i lack motivation and i’m just fucking lazy. I can’t even communicate that i need help with anyone and i don’t want to either it’s just so hard. i just want to die. I hate this and don’t want to continue any longer i just feel guilty to even think of suicide at times like this cause i feel like i’m just be wasting everyone’s time and being a disturbance when people have bigger things and problems to deal with. i want to go to A&E just to try to not harm myself but i know they don’t have time for someone like me when there’s many people who are in need of critical help."
"Valentines day, the perfect day for me to kill myself","I've been stuck in this vicious cycle of anxiety-depression-loneliness for over 4 years now. For the past 2 years I've had pretty much daily suicidal thought, I wrote my suicide note in november and now finally decided what day I'm gonna hang myself.

I'm 21 and ashamed of myself and hate myself in every way. I have zero confidence, I haven't achieved anything in my life, dropped out of college, anxiety makes me stress/freak out about thing other people do like it's nothing. Even regular conversations make me stressed because of how insecure I am. Got a horrible relationship with my parents. I don't enjoy anything anymore, every aspect of the future frightens me. Losing touch with my only few friends. Been starved of physical affection all my life beside of being abused by an older cousin when I was about 9. I've never even kissed a girl and now it's too late for me. I'm hopeless cause I'm too inexperiencedfor someone at my age and not good enough for anyone. I'm skinny af and fucking worthless no one has ever loved me or ever will.

Love only gives me negative feelings. It makes me anxious, panicky, makes me realize I'm not good enough. All the stuff I haven't done or experienced before makes me freak out  just by thinking about it so why even bother trying anymore. For the past months, despite trying to surpress it, i've been falling in love with the only female colleague I have a pretty good connection with but she's rediculously far out of my league, quit a lot older and will leave soon so it's another heartbreak either way. Better end it before yet another all time low. I have empathy and am glad for other people being happy and in a relationship but even just hearing a love song makes me instantly suicidal. So hopefully 14/02 will be the last day of my useless insignificant existance.

Every night I wish I would die in my sleep,But I'm still here
Anyone else get super depressed around the Holidays and just want to say fuck it and end things? Feeling that way now!,"I suffer from depression, clearly. However, this Holiday season I have been feeling it extra hard, and I don't know why. I have tried to do everything I can to cheer myself up. I've gone above and beyond generous with gifts for loved ones, even wrapping them nicely (not an easy feat for a klutz like me), was going to dress as santa on xmas for my baby nephews. Tried dressing a lot nicer at work. Figured fake it until I make it. It's worked in the past. But last night I found myself driving to my local gun store, about 30 minutes from me, and looking at guns to buy. I used to have a decent sized collection / cache but had given them all to my dad because of prior suicidal inclinations. Then over time I would take them and sell them at a gun store or pawn store for a quick buck. I don't have any more. I bought a Kbar combat knife a week ago and tried slashing my wrists while in the bath tub but couldn't do it. Just ending up cutting a little. However, last night I found myself wanting to buy a gun. However, with me as someone who likes guns I want the gun to have meaning. Isn't that fucked up? Like almost anyone will do, but I wanted something specific. Found one that was almost exactly what I wanted and priorly owned, but didn't end up purchasing it. Instead I drove around for a bit and just meditated. Although I am debating going back there today, getting that gun, driving to some scenic place and redecorating the interior of my car... 

I hate hurting people. I have seen what suicide has done to people. My best friend killed himself while drunk almost 5 years ago. It tore everything apart. My girlfriend's brother killed himself shortly before Thanksgiving and it has torn her apart. I have tried being there for her but of course keeping my feelings down. I also fear what does or doesn't come next. I most likely won't do shit, as I am a coward and I care too much, but damn do I want to just end my suffering..."
Does anyone else find that the fear of what’s on the other side keeps you from killing yourself but somehow that makes you more depressed?,I just feel like that survival instinct that kicks in just makes everything ten times worse. And people who say well that’s a sign that you shouldn’t do it don’t get how that isn’t it at all. I’m already not human I’ve already lost my mind I have nothing left. Like it just feels like torture.
"I didn't ask to be born, but I'm here and I'm forced to function and work on a world that I objectively hate. What do I do about this?","Obviously, nobody asks to be born into this world. I certainly didn't, but here I am at 24 years old. Simply put, I objectively dislike the world and society. I didn't ask to have to need participate in society and  to work in order to pay for food, shelter, etc., but of course most people will just say I'm lazy for not wanting to work. Can they really just not wrap their heads around that concept? How can I get over this involuntary existence without deep downbeing miserable every second of my life until I die? Again. I DID NOT ask to be a part of this, but since I'm here I have no choice other than to work and he miserable until I die. I feel so stuck and I also feel that I've never actually heard a real answer to these feelings other than ""well duh nobody asks to be born just get over it"". What the fuck do I do with that?"
Crippling Loneliness,I feel as if none of my friends actually like me. I hate my family. All I do is sleep. There's no fucking point.
i should have killed myself in 8th grade when i had the chance.,who ever said it gets better is a fucking liar. fuck you. im done. 
I need help... but I don't know what kind.,"I’m just putting this out there because Reddit seems to be the only place I can talk freely.    
    
I am so lost I don’t even know how to explain it.     
   
When I lost the only guy I had ever loved some six years ago, it really ripped my soul out. I never recovered from that. All the ambition, the positive thinking, the effort and the goals in my life just vanished.     
I kept on going through the motions for a while, but by the third year it was really just the bare minimum. Just enough to stay afloat. For a while I could live off that.     
But then the whole economic collapse failed and my industry caved in on itself, and the bare minimum became a struggle.     
It’s not that I couldn’t do more – I was, and am, capable. It’s just not in me. I have such a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I fear waking up, and cry every morning when I do.    
I am not pining for some guy anymore. I don’t even have the motivation to do that – it’s like I’m completely empty. I just don’t feel anything except this big heavy stone. It’s like everything that I was full of drained out of me, and there’s nothing left.    
I have, technically, a boyfriend. But he’s worthless – there’s nothing between us but a history and a facebook label. When I try to tell him how hopeless I feel… if I dare use the word “depressed,” then there’s hell to pay. A locker-room pep talk that starts with “you’re a worthless piece of shit! Do you wanna be a worthless piece of shit forever? Fight!” and ends with him muttering to himself and storming around the house. Eventually he calms down and apologises but then it’s just more lecture for a couple more hours until he runs out of steam. Nothing ever changes. Nothing gets better.     
And everything just keeps getting worse.    
    
Now, I can’t make this month’s rent.     
    
I was standing on the train platform last night for more than an hour, dreading going back home. Not because of a boyfriend I am so indifferent to that I can’t bother to dump him, not because of a rent that’s only a few hundred dollars low, not because of a dying industry that I might as well just change… but because of the thought that even if I do go home, even if I do go to sleep and wake up in the morning, it will be just as bad as it was yesterday, and will only get worse.    
    
I have been contemplating suicide for more than three years, but last night was the worst for a long time. I have researched it thoroughly, but can’t find a feasible, painless, quick solution. The pain terrifies me – the knowledge that a head lives for four minutes after decapitation. Guns aren’t available in this country. I have heard what aspirin overdoses do to the blood and how a person suffers before death. Perhaps the best option I have come up with yet is tubing the exhaust through the window of my car and letting it run…. I heard you just go to sleep.    
    
But I know that I didn’t jump on the tracks last night, and I haven’t taped up my car windows just yet, and for some reason I am here typing this long, long note out. So something in me – soul or no soul - doesn’t want to give up just yet. I don’t know what to do.     
    
...I think that when I wake up tomorrow morning, if I don't feel any better, I will just go ahead and jump. The station is only a five minute walk through the park. It only gets worse from here, anyways.
        
       
       
**edit:** When I woke up this morning, the first thing I did was to look on this page to see if anyone had written any advice. And I burst into tears. Seriously. I have never felt so protected, so warm, and so safe in any community as I do here. I found people to talk to, people who understand, people who sympathize, people who listen, people who have reached out a helping hand and given me a hug more sincere than any I have felt in years. There are no words of thank you that can encompass the gratitude and relief I feel. It's like in the darkness a rope has been thrown down to pull me out.      
      
Since I'm not really sure what to think and how to react, it has helped so much to read your messages. I will prepare something, some kind of *ongaeshi*, I will post it up soon!     
     
Once again.....    
Thank you for caring about me."
"“If you feel suicidal, call the suicide hotline or 911”","I can’t deal with constantly hearing and seeing this. Once, a long time ago, I called the suicide hotline and then they sent a ton of police to my house. Now I can’t drive for fear of getting pulled over by the police and getting triggered. I hate hearing it all the time, it’s just a lie. They aren’t going to help me, they’re going to send police to my house who will take me to a hospital and lock me in and then send me a bill that I can’t afford. I wish I could actually talk to the suicide hotline people without a legitimate fear of being locked up in inpatient."
i just want to know how to leave without making my mom sad.,"how is it, that i’m so young with so much life ahead of me, yet i feel so fucking trapped. i feel like i’m under water so deep and when my fingertips finally touch the surface i’m pulled back down. i don’t see myself graduating, i don’t see myself getting married, i don’t see myself giving birth, i don’t see myself in the future. i just want to know how to leave without making my mom sad.


edit: i am still here. my life has took a turn and has changed me. i look at life so much more positive now. if your scrolling deep down into this subreddit right now please read. if you are struggling, or relate to the past me^ please, know that no matter what anyone tells you, you are ENOUGH to stay on this earth. no matter what you go through, or how sad or depressed or suicidal you are right now, give yourself a break for a day, realize that you are only human and that you don’t have to meet ANYONES expectations. go at your own pace, you’re here for a long life, take it slow. things WILL (eventually) get better. go talk to your dogs, your cats, your fish, your mom/dad/sister/brother/grandma/grandpa/cousin/aunt/uncle, ANYONE who brings you a good laugh, and if you don’t have many of those people talk to me.  in conclusion, YOUR MOM WILL BE SAD. so please take into consideration that you’re worth every breathable second in this world. <3"
Those cheesy suicide prevention poems,"Go onto any YouTube video, or anything that is related to suicide, and you’ll get people who say something along the lines of this chessy ass Tumblr shit.

“Your skin isn’t paper, don’t cut it. Your life isn’t a film, don’t end it. Your face isn’t a mask, don’t hide it. Your size isn’t a book, don’t judge it. Don’t kill yourself, people out there care about you.”

Fuck off, we all know whoever came up with this quote don’t even know what depression is like and just made it up on Tumblr to get likes. If you did know what depression is like, you wouldn’t say that cheesy Hollywood bullshit. It’s sad too, because I saw a video of a kid who committed suicide, and the whole comment section was copied-and-pasted-filled with the same exact verse. If I was the kid who killed himself, and I was still alive somehow, I’d feel disrespected as fuck that all of these people are pretending to feel bad for me and sharing those cheesy ass rhymes. Bullshit."
Fuck girlfriends I just want a friend,"People always talk on here about being lonely and wanting a girlfriend but I honestly couldn't care less, I just want a friend. A single one. When you think about it, love is kind of selfish... the idea of wanting one person all to yourself *forever* is kind of psychotic. With friends however you can maintain a healthy distance but still enjoy each others company and also genuinely care about them. 

Anyone else feel the same way?"
My boyfriend killed himself a week ago,"And I really want to do the same. It hurts so much to miss him every second of every day. We were a good couple, with so much love for each other. We were each other’s everything. Whenever I had anxiety or was simply sad, the only thing that helped was his hugs and kisses. Now he’s not here anymore, he’s just ashes.

My friends got worried about me and got me committed against my will at a short term mental hospital and I just got out today, 12 days after his death.

I miss him with every fibre and molecule and atom of my being. It’s physically painful, insufferable. I can’t think about anything else.

I tried overdosing on Xanax with alcohol but I didn’t have enough, and when I woke up the next day I was so disappointed. This was before the hospitalisation. During the hospitalisation I was ok, better than now. But I don’t want to go back there, the place was awful.

The only reason I’m not attempting a new OD this very second is that it would kill (figuratively) my parents. Everyone would be sad. And I can’t do that to them. But at the same time, my love is never coming back and he’s all I want. All I need. NEED with every cell in my body. It physically hurts.

I wish I could disappear from their memories and just die and nobody would be sad. Because I can’t take it anymore. The grief is too big, too hard. What can I do to make it okay for everyone?"
"I've wanted to kill myself for awhile now, but just had my favorite soup","Something as simple as a good soup makes me want to stick around. Not only that but my guild on WoW Classic is very welcoming to me.

My sister's suicide this week.,"I’ve never posted here before, but I thought I’d share my story due to events that happened this week. I am Sophia’s younger brother (I have two older sisters, as well), and I am devastated by her suicide at her accommodation near the university she studied at. This is her Reddit account which she made this month: ([https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini](https://www.reddit.com/user/HumanZucchini)). I was not aware of how her thoughts had changed since I last met her in September 2018, and it’s unfortunate that I was not given the chance to contact her, as I have autism and depression too. I had no idea that she tried to run away before I contacted her on her birthday this month; she actually responded “Thank you, love you always!”, just two weeks ago from today.

&#x200B;

We had our fights and arguments in the past, but we sincerely amended this last year, and we enjoyed our older sister’s wedding together (when we went abroad in August 2018). I genuinely believed she would come home for the Easter holidays in a few weeks, as I accepted that she didn’t want to come home for Christmas due to wanting to excel in her studies. This tragedy has brought the family closer together: I had a heart-to-heart with my father, who I thought didn’t understand my emotions or cared enough about them; I vowed to stop being so shy and reclusive around family; I promised that if I ever felt like this, I would get in-touch immediately; I contacted my old friends from school and have planned to meet them again. I have been taken aback by all the supportive comments I received, even from people I never really spoke to that I assumed didn’t care for me.

&#x200B;

She was proud of me, because, last year, on the drive back home from the airport, she told me I had overcome so much, in regard to all my troubles and suicidal behaviour since 2015. I don’t want the same fate as her, because I feel responsible for this world, regardless of how much evil is committed every day, and I want to change it for the better in my life. Aside from the times that we fell-out, I tried to socialise with her, as she usually locked herself in her room and played music. I gave her documents that she requested me to print-out; I asked if she wanted to play Smash Bros. (I tried to teach her how to play, and I remember the time that I had a 300% handicap and still won); I asked if she wanted to get into the same cartoon shows as me (Steven Universe, Invader Zim, Star Vs. The Forces of Evil, etc.). I respected her decision to focus on her studies (I would have done the same), and I thought she would finally be able to spend this time with me during the summer, after finishing her undergraduate degree.

&#x200B;

Whenever the funeral service is planned, I intend to sing ‘Love Like You’ (the credits theme from Steven Universe), in-front of all the attendees. She couldn’t get into the show from watching the first five episodes (she thought it was too goofy), but she liked the songs from the show, even from episodes she hadn’t seen before. I remember she was listening to ‘Stronger Than You’ and ‘Dear Old Dad’ whilst studying at home. Thank you for all the memories, and I won’t let you down.

&#x200B;

I posted this here, as she posted on this subreddit this month, and I want to help and talk to people who feel this way, because I have felt like this before. I also posted this on Suicide Bereavement. "
Thank you,"I dont know if this post breaks the rules, but Ill try my luck with it. I just want to say thank you to every wonderful human being who adds to this subreddit. As someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts forever, finding this community has been amazing. 

One of the worst feelings ive ever had was being completely and utterly alone. I cant even imagine how much easier my struggles would have been with awesome, compassionate, empathetic people like you. Please know that you help so much. Thank you. "
I just need a hug,"That's all i need, a 20 min hug from someone who needs it back. "
Don't take the pills... It hurts,"So I don't think this will stop people from ending their but maybe it will make someone rethink it. Today I tried to overdosed on 1000mg of antidepressants, at about 8:30pm I took ten pills and waited.

Now obviously, I didn't die. But it feels like I am. After about an hour I got dozy, had a hard time keeping my head up and stuff. I wasn't scared, I wasn't sad I was just so groggy. Ten minutes after that my stomach began to ache.

For half an hour I threw up stomach acid violently. I felt like I was going to pass out, so I went to my room to lay down, hell I should've gone to a hospital. The dizziness got worse and I was gagging constantly. I couldnt lay down without hurting, I couldnt sit up without falling down and standing up out of the question. Even now, almost four hours later my body is in small spasms and I'm having a hard time just typing because my body is shaking uncontrollably.

My head still hurts and I cant focus on much, Im exhausted and I cant sleep. This isnt fun, I wish that I didnt do this honestly. I wish I didnt try like this. So if you read this and youre thinking of ending your life with pills, just give it a second thought because its not a painless death."
I woke up,"I woke up this morning, and the moment I opened my eyes and understood that I was awake I started crying.

If that's not a sign then I don't know what is."
"So I listen to music to calm myself and to numb down my suicidal thoughts for a bit, is this weird or do other people do it too and btw I usually listen to iamJakehill’s suicidal thoughts song look it up on YouTube/Spotify if you’re curious and this sub honestly makes me feel at home thank you",Have a nice day:)
I’ll talk to my mom this week,im gonna tell her i want to kill myself and i’ll ask her to put me in the hospital. i hope she’ll care. bc im strong enough to ask for help. and if she won’t believe me probably i’ll hurt myself.
I've finally hit my limit,"I've been steadily getting worse over the past six months. No amount of medication seems to be helping, and I can't for the life of me seem to be able to get into counselling.

Finally got some respite in a small holiday for a wedding, and when it came to it I freaked out and missed the entire ceremony, set of the alarm to the villa and ruined everything. The reception is happening as I type this.

Now I'm just in bed absolutely dreading having to face everyone again. I've no handle on my anxiety and I've no idea where to even begin. 

I'm sick of fucking up absolutely everything. I can't do this anymore. 

I feel so ridiculous for being set off by this one little thing, but I've hit my limit. I plan on killing myself the night we get the plane back home. eeeh, thanks for letting me rant I guess. see you on the other side"
"My best friend and partner in crime just committed suicide, i'm going to join her this evening.","My entire world has gone from shitty but bearable to just 'gone' in the last two months. I had to put my schoolyear on hold because I got diagnosed with depression, got put on antidepressants, my parents consider me a failure but throughout all that, I had one light, one rock to lean on. I would always look forward to doing stuff with her and now she's gone, just like that... She even made me a promise that she would wait but I get that she couldn't wait for me. That's ok, I have 80 clonazolams, some flunitrazolam and some trazodone that i will take this evening with some drinks so if it doesn't kill me it will knock me out nice and long so I wont have to deal with reality for a bit."
Dad's friends raped me.,"I feel paralyzed. I barely had enough energy to open up the computer. I don’t feel anything but an awfulness that crawls through my skin and an endless hollowness devoid of any light. I’d been in the shower for almost an hour and I just can’t get it out. It’s crippling me and I’m helpless. I have no one else to tell this and I just want to kill myself. I just want the pain to end.

I feel so much hate and anger but I can’t seem to muster the energy to do anything about them; even you dad. I hate you so much for letting them do this to me. I hate you so much for doing absolutely *nothing* while they raped me. Is that what friends do dad?; getting you drunk and raping your daughter? None of this would’ve happened if mom was still here. She would’ve stopped them. It hurt so much I thought they were going to kill me. Now I wish they had.

You changed a lot after her death. You stopped asking how my day was. You stopped coming to pick me up from school. All my friends they thought that my dad coming to pick me up was lame but I only wanted to see you as soon as school was over. That’s how much I love you. Do you remember telling me how much you loved me and the things you’d do for me? You only had to show a little of it dad. You only had to stay sober. You only had to remember that I’m always here for you. But no, you chose the bottle over me. And I didn’t mind cleaning up after you. I didn’t mind when you talked harsh to me even though it hurt like hell. It’s the demons you brought in with you. You let them take control of you. You let them hurt me. But I still love you dad. I always will. Maybe when I’m gone I could look after you from up above like mom was supposed to.


I needed to tell all of this to you dad. I needed to cry on your shoulders one last time but I don’t have the courage and you don’t have your mind. I hope it’s not you who finds me. Sweet dreams dad. Remember me and please forgive me."
YOUR KID'S MENTAL STATE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THEIR GRADES.,"I'm fucking tired of adults only fucking worrying about grades it's fucking stupid. (Ex: my parents know I'm suicidal, only worry about grades) I don't fucking care about grades if I'm planning on killing myself and I don't think y'all do either. And it just makes it worse for you to say 'you working on you grades?' all the time when im clearly fucking looking like i am wanting to die. But no.  To them that's not fucking important."
Kinda wish I could just restart as a different person,"There's no extremely traumatic event that happened in my life, just unhealthy people propagating and creating more unhealthy people like me. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live this particular life either"
I'm the worst doctor in the whole world,"I can't do anything right. Academically I faceplanted my way through school. Socially I can't even get a girl to hold my hand. Even Michael Rotondo that 30-year-old basement dweller guy had a exwife and son.

If nothing else medical school gave me the necessary information on how to go out peacefully. Was it worth $200,000? I don't know but luckily after this evening I won't have to ponder it anymore.

if someone finds this from my browsing history: I'm sorry to mom and dad and ""I"" (first name initial, you know who you are). If it helps, I was going to kill myself earlier but wanted to wait till graduation so at least you can know your son accomplished something in life. Please use that to comfort you in the dark times ahead. I'm in a better place now."
This world is literally just as bad or worse as my depression makes it out to be.,"You have to be out of touch with reality to deny what's going on. People say that those with depression see the world with pessimism, but life sucks for everyone. I have no hope for the future, people die all the time in awful ways, it's hard to get out of poverty, it's hard to live with mental health issues. It just seems so much more ethical to stop all of this madness and leave. I want to peace out of this whole thing. I'm going insane being here and it just gets worse all the time."
I feel lost,"From trying to help people on SuicideWatch I ended up being one of the ones that need help. How ironic, am I right?
It just feels so unfair...I, a person that never did anything right and never really clinged to life, gets to live while many, many good people have to die. I don't like it, that's unfair. I wish I could offer each of them a year of my existence. I want to see them enjoy the warm sunlight on their skin, pet a dog again, eat some ice cream.
Meanwhile I am here, feeling like my heart is being torn apart, like my body is always cold and frail and unable to cry even though I know I need to.
I feel so lost and lonely. I keep thinking about suicide and how many people I would disappoint by doing that...I just want to feel alive or offer my life to who really needs it."
being “fine” or “numb” but you still wanna die is the worst,when you can have a good day or be feeling alright but still wanna be six feet under
I was wrong,"I hate when people say to think of how much pain you'll cause others. They'll get over it, I always think. I'm just a burden anyway. They'll be sad for awhile, but better off in the long run.

Yesterday I intended to kill myself. My ex/roommate (it's complicated) caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me. When my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me. She was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong, but I could feel her whole body shaking.

She sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular. Just talked, joked, and laughed like we do. But even half an hour later I could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine. She was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me, but inside she was a wreck. Later, when I went up to our room to sleep, she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow. It was such a small gesture, but it  made me feel loved.

I knew she would be sad, but I still underestimated how much she cared. I don't know if I'll ever forget that feeling. I don't think I should.

I wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like I do. I was wrong. You might be too. There are plenty of people in my life who have turned out to not care at all when I thought they did. There's at least one who cares a whole lot more than I gave her credit for. "
The fact that i'm shy is the main reason why i'm suicidal,"I wish i could say hi to someone without thinking about it 30 minutes beforehand

I wish i could ask someone a basic question without nearly breaking down

I wish i didn't have to rely on other people approaching me first, so i could make friends by myself

I wish i was confident enough to approach girls without my brain sabotaging me constantly

I wish i could be confident enough to believe that a girl will someday love me

I wish i could walk in public without believing that everyone is judging me and without my heart going absolutely crazy

I wish i could go to the gym, but i always pussy out because i believe everyone there will make fun of me and try to beat me up

I just wish i could be a normal human being"
I wish...,"...I could donate my lifetime to somebody that is in need of it. Like young people suffering from deadly diseases or something. They want to live but can't, I don't want to live but can. Would be the perfect swap."
I wish life had checkpoints or a reset button,"2018 has been absolutely horrible for me. I feel like I've ruined every connection to people I had. It feels like everyone hates me. I have a severe lack of trust in people that over and over again gets proven justified. I barely sleep at all or I sleep too much. I cry every day multiple times but most of the time it's for no reason at all or it's because my life is just so sad. I can barely function at work. I've been struggling with food for the last few months where I can't seem to eat normally. It's either eat way too much or I go at least a day without eating. I keep planning to do things like go for a walk or go see a movie by myself but I fail every time.

I wish it would just stop but I feel like I have absolutely no control over what happens in my life and there's no way to change it. "
I want to die so bad,"I want to die so bad. I'm tired of being alone, I'm tired of feeling worthless, self loathing, I'm just tired. I'm tired of people taking me for granted, I'm tired of watching people fuck up after I put in effort to help them. I feel so undervalued.
I hate myself...I want to kill myself..."
Why are people acting like it's always irrational when somebody wants to die?,"I have no friends, no social (or any) skills, no job or any normal basic experiences. I don't fit in anywhere and I can't function in society. It makes sense in my situation that I want to die. I believe almost everyone would feel the same if they eyperienced the same things. I don't feel human anymore. Objectively it would be better if I didn't exist. I just keep suffering and it's exhausting and tiring."
Why is suicide looked down upon but mental health is often overlooked during the entire buildup?,"What's the point of going on when you lost everything? No family anymore, no gf anymore, no joy in life anymore, no pursuit of knowledge, due to depression confiding you to a bed, no bettering of yourself through exercise due to debilitating monotony of earning a paycheck bi-weekly while executives earn 10-100x your salary for your menial work.

I read that Alan Turing, who was a brilliant computer scientist and responsible for saving millions of lives during World War 2, was forced to be chemically castrated for being gay. His hormones got fucked up and took away all joy in his life, his thirst for knowledge, and eventually made him take his own life. Was he weak? No, but defeated, chemically and without purpose.

We're told suicide is selfish. But if it is so selfish, why do people abandon you at your lowest and leave you to deal with what seems insurmountable at the time all alone? Where were they when they proclaimed that suicide is a selfish act when you were going weeks-months in pain trying to fix a mess without any support?

Nobody wants to hear your problems. If you bring them up they will tell you to hopeful things with empty words then disappear for a while. Life's short, you fuck up and are in it alone then good luck. People will always remember your wins, but when you talk about mental health all of a sudden it gets weird and stigmatized. Then you ask yourself am I doing enough, is it worth bringing up, or is the harsh reality that nobody really cares until the decision is made?"
"I'm so sick of this ""find a job you love"" bullshit","There's not a single job I can think of that doesn't sound like 100% misery, I don't even want to be alive, yet I'm forced not only to be here, but to pay for it"
I feel like the struggles of young adults and teens on this sub aren't treated as seriously because they are young.,"I've seen many people here see someones age being under 25 or so and just downplay their feelings because ""they have a lot of time to fix it."" I see it especially with teens. Many people simply say to ""give it time, your angsty, your horomones are raging, etc..."" and I wont deny that certainly plays a part in it. However, I think it's dangerous to put all teens under this blanket, as many are truly suffering from issues that cant be fixed by simply becoming an adult. Someone looking for support here doesnt want to have their feelings downplayed and ignored, regardless of the cause of them."
How I found my older brother commited suicide,"I am 26 years old right now, and not a day goes by where I don't think about my older brother. People used to ask me when I was a kid if I had any siblings and I would always point to my older brother and say ""He's my brother"". 

Now I just say I'm an only child and leave it at that. Half of my friends don't know I had a brother, because I don't want to mention it. 

Well, here goes the story that I never told anyone before. Me and my older brother were like two peas in a pod. We used to do everything together. Play sports, watch movies, and like other brothers, we used to fight. But with every fight, we always had the gift of being able to make up with each other and still be brothers that love each other. 

I used to say rude things to him, I used to call him a jerk and a mean person, but I never really meant it. 
So my brother was 18 years old when he was dead. I remember he was unusually quiet the days before his suicide, and he was complaining about something to dad, that I never really know what until I later realized it was about anxiety. 

He taught me how to make something called paper airplanes, where you got paper and made them into airplanes. It was fun, I used to get paper airplanes and throw them to his room and see how far It would land, and then he would get some paper and shoot it back at my room every morning. 

Every other morning he would shoot a paper airplane at my room when I was just waking up. Sorta of our way of saying good morning to each other.

So one day, I woke up. I looked around and there was no paper airplane in my room. I guess I slept longer than him, but I never do. He usually wakes up at like 7 am in the morning. I checked the time and it was 11 am. 
I made a paper airplane and threw it at his room. 
He would usually show himself and play tackle me or tickle me when I did but no one came out the room. I opened the door fully and he wasn't in his bed. 

That's when I looked around and saw the paper he used to make paper airplanes out of, it was all neat and nothing was really ripped apart or touched like it usually was. 

I saw the closet was mildly open and that's when I saw the same image that sticks with me to this very day. I saw my brother in the closet with his eyes mildly open mildly closed, and his face with a pale expression, almost like a frown. I remember his skin color looked odd. I thought he was just standing at first but he was a bit taller. I saw something was holding him up and then I saw the little rope by his throat holding him up. I didn't know what he was doing, I thought it was a prank he made to scare me. I touched his chest and then pushed him. I then started yelling and pushing him violently and then screamed for my mom and dad. By then tears were on my eyes.

But I can tell you right now, if I had to choose something that tore me apart more... My brother's lifeless body or my parents reaction to it, I would have chose parents reaction. 

My dad came into the room, followed by my mom, and for some reason I just didn't want to be in that room anymore and I let myself out to the hallway. Then I heard screaming of my brother's name from my mom, and then some type of noise. I think it was my dad pushing my brother's body, like me. They started sobbing. I went to peek back in the room and then I saw my dad shaking and whimpering. He was a tough guy he never cried in any sad movies me, my brother, and him used to watch together but he was crying nonstop. My mom was just standing there with her lips quivering... her teeth shaking, and her eyes were red. I didn't notice it but I was crying too. My whole body was shaking. 

I ripped up all my paper in my room and I felt like throwing up and spitting out my insides, I then just sat down in my bed for seemingly hours. I never wanted to leave the room, and all I could think about was if this was some sort of nightmare that I was in. I tried going like the cartoons and pinched myself, I used my nails to cut myself deep in my skin to wake me up, I scratched harder till there were marks on my arms but I never woke up. I never woke up.

Every night now, I always wonder what my brother would be like when he was around my age now, and if he would have had a family by now. 

Every year on the day of my brother's death, I throw a paper airplane to a river, and every day I would hope to wake up in my room with a paper airplane lying in my bed, from my older brother. That's the story of my brother's suicide. "
Cancer is back and I'm done.,"Well I'm screwed. I'm out of meds to try for it and they cant operate because I did radiation. So now I'm doing shots at 5 am trying to forget today happened. I knew it was going to happen because everything was going so well. I told myself I'd never drink again and well that went right out the window. So now I'm here being the usual failure I am. I dont even think I'm gonna make it to my 21st birthday. That was one of my only goals and now I'm not even gonna be able to do that. And with this stupid virus I cant travel like I wanted to. So I'm 0 for 2. Sorry for the rambling but I feel broken and I cant put it together. Goodnight💙

Edit: I'm gonna pass out but thanks for the thoughts. I dont think God gonna heal me at the fact that this is relapse 4, but it's the thought that counts💙"
Does anyone else wanna die but doesn’t have the guts to kill themselves,I just want to get hit by a car on the way to school i feel like my life is so worthless. Tryna find a reason to live is so hard 
[F17] - Feeling numb and lonely as fuck,"Thanks to my fucking shyness and awkwardness I ended up being seen as a weird and retarted kid since my age of 6, when I started school. Parents were so worried about me they forced me to hang around with neighbours that didn't like me that at all. I was neglected and made fun off every since. I also had acne and poor motorics which made me ever more sadder. Now I'm in high school and a little progress happened - it seems no one cares about me, I'm in a club, looking better... But scared of future and everything. I have 0 friends, never had a bf, believing I must be very boring and aloof to actually have meaningful relationships. I'm OK with family - but I never told them I want to kill myself. I plan to visit a Halloween party at one club alone and if nothing happens I'm gonna overdose. I just wanna feel loved at once.

Update: OMG I didn't expect so many responses to come up that fast... Thank you all!"
How CAN'T people be depressed,"seeing how fucked up and selfish humanity is?
I just can't bare when I point out animal cruelity  or wage slavery or bullshit in religion or bullshit of politics and non depressed people are like ""whatever... what can you do... focus on being productive"".

Oh yea, PRODUCTIVITY I love that word, it keeps sheeple in a fucking line... Just obey your 33 loving  overlords and then you will get a cookie and a paycheck to paycheck life. "
It's time. Goodbye Reddit.,"I am currently driving to visit my grandmothers grave for one last time. Then I will attempt to OD, if I fail then I will give an update. If I don't update then I am either dead or in the hospital. I just thought I should update those that have tried to help me. Thank you all and please just remember that my mind was already made up. 

To everyone else on this sub Reddit. I hope that you all can overcome the difficulties that are trying to bring you down. If not I understand, I am in that place where it will never get better. 

Goodbye. I love you all. "
"I tried to ask my family for help, and their answer is ""God"".","Im from a third world country, and my entire family is very religious, I'm not. 

While I respect their choice to belive in something, they dont respect mine. They think that depression is a joke, that it's just an excuse for ""lazy"" people. I tried to explain to them how the human body works, but a simple concept like cells and hormones doesnt make sense to them.

Im alone. Im 20, I dont have a job, I dont have friends, and the only joy that I have in this world is to talk with my ""online friends"" and that is starting to fade away. I never met my mother and my father ( the only person that tried to help me get out of this hole ) hanged himself 2 years ago, and now I have to hear things like ""he is going to end like his dad if he doesnt find God"".

Help me internet."
I can't be the only one who started 2019 in tears,I wish I was brave enough to follow through with it. I can't because I don't know what awaits me after that. I can't put my best friend through another suicide funeral. I'm in tears
I don't think people really care until you actually die. And even then they might not care,"If I make a post on reddit I usually get ignored.

Even when someone listens to me and responds, they usually ghost me after some time.

If I want to talk to a professional, they are only there because of money, because they know that it's their job and they have to do it because if they don't they won't have money to eat.

No one really cares"
"Wake up, browse reddit, watch porn, contemplate suicide, repeat","Man fuck this shit. People say it gets better, no it gets worse. Legitimately considering trying to stab myself in the jugular. I was sexually abused and mutilated and no one cares. People laugh at my problems call me crazy. Theres to much contradiction here. Hurt me, tell me its no big deal, tell me i'll get over it, laugh at me. Either kill me or care for me I can't stand this inbetween flip floppy bull shit. Its torture. Everyone would be better without me anyway I'm just a problem generator. It hurts so much. If theres a god he knows no mercy.



Edit fuck, man i need some weed. I need some love. Maybe I'll find some at the bottom of the river"
Not expecting much from here. Even the crisis hotline counselor was speechless,"I just need to vent.

I'm a single gay man in my late 30's. Seen multiple mental health professionals over the years. Been there, done that. Have a couple of college degrees. I don't drink or do drugs.

I always prided myself with employment yet struggled to find meaningful employment. I found myself working with autistic children and public service which I liked, but it's not a stable job. I had a period of unemployment a few years back and did something stupid things that led to a criminal investigation (not important what). Realizing that my career working with kids and in government was over, I quickly landed a job in corporate America.

Then I was charged and after a lengthy discussions between my lawyer and the DA, I got five years probation and two suspended sentence. I was doing well despite being a felon because no one knew - my job, my neighbors, my family. A year into probation, I got violated for having a bullet. Ironically, I had purchased a gun in case I was facing serious time. So I went to prison for two years. It was awful. There was nothing rehabilitative about it. While everyone talked about getting high once they got out, I talked about getting a job.

I was released early and sent to a halfway house in the hood. I found an accounting job at a small business that did not do a background check. A year later, it went out of business. I said ""fuck it"" and started applying for those high-paying corporate jobs and would try to beat a background check. It worked. I landed the highest-paying job I ever got. With health insurance too. It was a lot of work, but worth it.

Lately I had been feeling suicidal. Burned out. Anxious. Overwhelmed. The one thing that kept me going was my job. It took up most of my time and gave me financial peace (which is underrated).

Then I got fired today.

Not sure what happened, but three months into the job and passing my background check, they fired me for lying. It's beyond me how they found out. I think a co-worker found out and dropped a dime on me. I was a good worker. I left feeling ashamed, degraded, defeated, etc. I can't do this again. It's not like there was good jobs for a middle-age felon. That's a lie. Been through all the social services designed to help people like me and they didn't and couldn't help. It had to be up to me.

To keep on trying to make it is senseless. It's insanity.

I called a crisis hotline and laid it all onto the counselor. He was speechless and all he could say is how it must be tough and offered to call me in a few days. I wasn't expecting anything.

I think he understood. Killing myself is the only thing that has made sense to me in years.

I've been keeping it all in me for so long and it feel like a relief. I thought about killing myself only after my mom dies, but truth be told I have been and am in too much pain and it's not fair to me. I'd rather die and leave my savings to her. I feel bad for anyone that feels like they let me down or could have done something (they couldn't or wouldn't).

There is this part of me that fears death less. What I fear is my future. At least death is inevitable.

Again, not expecting anything life changing on here. The next few days will be brutal. I have crossed a point of no return today.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I spent the better part of the weekend getting high off my ass, binge eating and sleeping. I looked in the mirror and look like shit. My apartment is a wreck. I thought to myself what my next step is and all of them were ""tying"" up loose ends. It's just too complicated, high-risk low-reward, expensive, much pressure, etc. to move on with life. It takes up too much of my life and I was already dealing with too much and I don't have the energy to do it anymore. People like me who choose life under these circumstances end up going back to prison and/or on the streets. I'd rather die."
3 weeks ago i attempted suicide and no one knows,"November 23, 2019 I attempted suicide. I have not told anyone, or very little people. I tried to hang myself due to a broken heart and stress. After the attempt i started to view the world around me differently and see that maybe i am wanted.... I haven't really felt the need to take my life after that as i met a guy whom i like a lot. The work day after my suicide attempt was different, I noticed people actually seemed to care. Or, i saw some accomplishment in myself. I yet to seek help for my mental issues, but so far im trying to figure things out."
My sister told me to kill myself,"My sister and I used to be best friends. But I noticed as when she grew older, she started to develop a ""grudge"" against me. She got angry at me more easily, and would stay in her room all day and never speak to anyone. I tried to connect with her because I still loved her, but she would shut me out of her life. And because of this, my sister and I haven't spoken to each other in three months.

My sister was up at 4:00 am today and I couldn't sleep so I went to her room and told her to go to bed. She started yelling at me while mom heard her, and went upstairs. As soon as she reached her room, she turned off the light at the last minute and went to bed.

Five minutes after that happened, I heard a voice in the dark say, ""I hate you. I wish you would die. Go kill yourself.""

I realized that it was coming from my sister's room. I got up and said, ""What? What did you just say?""

""I hate you. I wish you would kill yourself. Just die already.""

I didn't know why she was saying this, so I started crying and went downstairs. My heart felt like it was being shattered into pieces and my chest felt heavy.

I told my parents everything, and my mom went upstairs again to confront her. My dad stayed with me, and held me as I cried. He said that he was very disappointed at her (even though she was his favorite).

Mom came back downstairs again and told me that she was going to apologize to me in the morning.

She never did. In fact, she pretended that *nothing* ever happened. She pretended that I didn't even exist. She was happy.

The worst part, was how my sister *knew* I was suicidal. Back when she was ""nice"", I told her about my feelings and how I wanted to kill myself, and she shared my sympathy. Now, she shames me because of it. She shames me for being depressed and tells me that I was a mistake and blames me for my parents' suffering. She told me that I was their least favorite child and that she was their favorite. She told me that she hated me everyday.

This morning, I tried to hang myself with my dad's belt, but I failed.

Now I have to wake up everyday, knowing the fact that my sister is truly gone.

Edit- Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cgh5nz/my\_sister\_told\_me\_to\_kill\_myself\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cgh5nz/my_sister_told_me_to_kill_myself_part_2/)"
"i don't think life sucks, i just genuinely believe living isn't for everyone","grew up in a household with parents passively hating eachother for the past 12 years openly in front of me and my siblings but won't divorce because they can't do well financially on their own. would often talk bad about the other to us and would use us to communicate when they wouldnt want to talk to eachother. 

did great at school and was a happy and active kid until highschool when all the pressure to excel became overwhelming and I started having anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't focus anymore and started giving up on school, stopped doing all activities I used to love and harmed myself. 

started having suicidal thoughts and a year after I attempted. felt a little better after some hospitalization, but talking to a psychologist made me realize even more how more fucked my life was and i started self harming again and stopped showing up to appointments.

was suicidal again but somehow got a great boyfriend. i've been so happy with him these past months. but with him only. i was just as depressed and suicidal as i was before, except when i was spending time with him. 

i don't have any goals in life anymore, i can't go to college and i work minimum wage. also, i'm really sensitive about what's going on in the world and it makes me loose hope for humanity. 

i don't think life sucks, i genuinely just believe living isn't for everyone. some people are able to make the most of it and find happiness, but some just don't have the right mentally and tools and it should be okay for them to leave if that's what makes them happy. 

it hurts to have someone you love die, i understand that, but what good does it make to try and keep someone who isn't happy and won't be happy in the future and let them suffer for years to come? wouldn't that hurt? 

also before you guys mention my boyfriend, yeah i love him, but love never really lasts. and at this point, i'm so sensitive that if we ever have a fight or go through a rough time, I would definitely break and kill myself, cause he's pretty much the only thing that still makes me genuinely happy. and i can't imagine how bad it would be if i left that way, i don't want him to blame himself, he doesn't deserve that. i would rather leave when we're still on great terms."
I want someone to take care of me like they’d take care of a child,"I guess this is my survival instinct’s last line of defence. This naive and delusional hope that someone could come and pick up the pieces of me, gently put me back together, literally provide for me and take care of all the adult stuff. Hold me when I cry and relieve me of any responsibilities until I’m actually capable of getting back up on my feet. And that everything will be okay after that. 

I’m 25, but I can’t take care of myself. I know people around me think I can, because this wall I’ve built around myself is tall enough that no one can see the dumpster fire going on inside it. Everything’s falling apart and I’m sitting here just crying. Because I’ve put off asking for help for so long, that the amount of help I would need right now isn’t available. 

Also, it’s like I’m no longer sad because things are shitty, I’m sad because this delusional hope, that’s just survival instinct in disguise, clouds my judgement and catches me between a rock and a hard place. I’m exhausted."
Does anyone feel like a functioning suicidal?,"I feel like I could end it all at any second and get some relief. But I also go through the motions of life like I'm planning to live for so much longer. I go to class for the most part, eat food, try to look groomed on the outside. In a way, I feel like people can't take me seriously. All my so called friends just look at me like there's nothing wrong with me. Even though I tell them things, it's like the end of the day I look okay on paper, so I must be okay. My parents know I feel like this but they already have my life planned out and I feel trapped. It's been a constant trend in my life where even if I tell people I'm struggling, no one believes me. I think that's part of what has driven me to this point because no one wants to help. I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this way 

Edit: I'm honestly surprised at how much attention this has gotten. I just want you all to know that your feelings and thoughts are valid no matter what and should be treated as such. There's still a lot of stigma about mental health in general but I fully believe everyone is entitled to treatment and a therapist who will sympathetically listen to their problems no matter what. None of you deserve anything less than that. I've tried my best to respond to all the people who responded but my inbox is always open to messages if anyone wants to say anything. Thank you guys so much for making me feel like this isn't so abnormal"
I stay alive because I’m guilted into remaining on this earth to avoid causing pain to my loved ones.,"I wish I had the inner strength to actually follow through on my plan - take a Greyhound bus to a different state and and kill myself there. No one would be able to identify me, I would be a Jane Doe and my loved ones would just think I got kidnapped or something. "
I got into a car accident this morning and my last thought before impact was “I hope this kills me”.,"I hit my head and likely have a concussion. I’ve had headaches and slight dizziness all day. Can’t afford the doctors bills, and it’s the end of the year so it’s not like paying towards my deductible would do any good. So, may as well say fuck it, hope that I die in my sleep, and let it be. Suicide to me has become similar to the ending of Batman Begins. “I won’t kill you, but I don’t have to save you.” So bring on the tobacco, liquor, or whatever. Let it be “stoicistic suicide”."
Is there anyone else struggling today?,Or is it just me?
"Relationships are temporary, be it friendship or romantic relationships. I feel so alone and I can’t grasp / hold on to anything because they always just go away at the end. It’s so painful to live I don’t wanna see another day. I feel like I’m living inside a game that I can’t quit.","We are all alone, you are either aware of it or you are not. "
Ever jump to the thought of suicide over minor inconveniences?,"I can’t be the only one I’m sure. Any minor inconvenience; a mistake I made, getting yelled at by parents, beating myself up over things that are out of my control even.

My mind just automatically goes to death in those cases. I guess I’ve gotten so used to considering it an option and thinking about it multiples times a day, that when any inconvenience happens, my mind jumps to “you should kill yourself” right away. 

Thing is, when I try to talk to, say, my best friend about it, he listens and then responds with “how can you think these things?” I’m made to feel as though it’s my fault for jumping to the idea of death so easily and thinking the things I do.

 I feel invalidated when I talk about those thoughts to him, especially if the reason is something small. I usually also get shut down immediately with “that’s not you that’s thinking these things, it’s the thoughts” or “that’s not what you want”, or better yet, “that’s dumb/stupid.”

Edit: Maybe it’s because the idea of suicide brings me peace and calms me down in overwhelming situations. I know that if I kill myself, all my problems will go away and I won’t have to be worried about anything anymore. It’s probably weird to say the idea of killing myself makes me happy or brings me peace but it literally does somehow."
The biggest lie I have ever been told was that you should treat others the way you’d want to be treated.,"People will treat you like shit regardless. You can give your best to people and they will still treat you how they want to. I am done trying to be good to people who aren’t good to me. The funny part is after it’s all said and done, you will still feel like the bad guy even though you weren’t in that situation. I just don’t care enough to live in a world that doesn’t care about me."
“Death is permanent you can’t come back”,"It’s amazing to me how many people say this sort of thing to stop someone from wanting to kill themself. 

Don’t you get it? That’s the point. I don’t want to be here. I don’t want to change my mind. Do you really think I’m so delusional that I believe I’ll die then decide I could have lived longer and come back? Are you really so delusional you don’t see I want to die because it means I won’t be coming back?"
"Took the pills, drink the beer, get cold and post on Reddit before I die.","Been putting off killing myself, but I took the pills (benzos and opiates and can depressant meds) this time, drank some beer to kick it all into gear... Fingers and legs are getting very cold... 

I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone here... You all tried your best

Edit: added some more meds to make sure it does the trick. Just so done

Dec 8th, 2018

I am so sorry to all of you! I did end up overdosing, but not enough to finish the job. I ended up getting really sick though and puking on pretty much everything. I have a traumatic brain injury (childhood abuse and concussions) and so it affected me a ton because of that. I spent the last several days not able to focus my eyes. I would wander around my room like a zombie, not able to comprehend pretty much anything. I am on a ton of meds for other medical stuff and I got really sick from not taking my meds when I was not able to think clearly. I am finally able to read (and comprehend), otherwise, I would have updated you all... I honestly didn't think my post would get any attention, and I remember only bits and pieces of the last several days. I am still not to 100% but no one knows, except for my friend who has also attempted; I didn't want any judgment. 

I am doing okay, had some SI's creep in again but I beat them back. I am still in a daze that I could have died... and I was, and am still, okay with that, but now it feels like life is super surreal... 

You are all really kind, and seeing this much love from so many strangers has helped me in a significant way"
I often fantasize about what others would do if I ended it,"I imagine my teachers talking to my classmates about how I was found hanging in my room. I imagine people finally realizing that I wasn't just having a few bad days, that me saying ""I want to kill myself"" everyday was real. I imagine the utter sadness and horror people would experience knowing that I'd done it. I feel like I get closer every day. Every molecule of my very being is begging for the end, and I don't think I can keep holding them back for long."
Killing myself isn't selfish,"Why should i give a fuck about other people's feelings when i end it? They never gave a fuck about mine when i was alive. Not my family, not the people i know. 

Me ending my own pain is not selfish. And if i am selfish, so fucking what? Every single cunt on this earth is selfish. People are selfish for wanting someone who wants to help themselves to live on for their own benefit. I don't give a fuck. 

If you don't give a shit about me when i was alive, dont come crying to my funeral like a fucking idiot. Fuck off."
"Anyone wish they would get hit by a car or bus or get an incurable cancer, instead of the stigma their family would receive from suicide.","I wish I got hit by a car or bus or got some incurable disease to die. I truly wish somebody facing death from a disease could have my body so that they could use it well and develop friends and relationships and spend time with their family and pursue their dreams. Trade me please, I know what I would be walking into and wouldn’t regret a thing. 

I don’t want my family to receive the stigma from my suicide. People will think they have failed me or that our family is broken. It’s not true, it’s me and my fault. 
People can say you’ll be dead so why would you care. Truth is we don’t know for sure what happens after death."
I feel like a robot that the only way to turn my feelings off and put my mind on “numb mode” is by aimlessly watching YouTube videos,I wish I was dead
Someone saved my life today,"I know this is a bit different from what people typically post on this thread but I don’t know who to tell. I don’t want to tell anyone that I was minutes away from killing myself. But that’s exactly what just happened. 

I’m up at college right now, it’s my third semester. Things haven’t been easy for me. I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression and seasonal affected disorder. All my roommates have gone home for the holidays, they finished their finals yesterday and I still had one more to do today. 

I’ve also been struggling with a lot of financial and family issues. I recently changed my major to geology from accounting. My mom is an accountant and so is everyone else on her side of the family (4 out of the 7 kids in her family are accountants). My dad is an economics major. They don’t see any value in geology at all and so we’ve been arguing quite often about my future and my goals for life. This, however, isn’t the first time my family has feuded with me. I’m sort of the black sheep of the family. Anyway they just pulled out financial support for my schooling, they refuse to give me their SSN for my Federal student aid application, and since they pay for my health insurance and phone bill I’m declared a dependent and my university can’t override my FAFSA application. I tried to get a loan with my bank where I have my own independent account, but they said a co-signer is required for my loan. My parents refuse to sign it. I reached my breaking point earlier after an argument with my brother where he said his problems easily outweighed mine and I shouldn’t worry about going home (my brother and I go to the same university). 
I wrote my suicide note and I was holding a bottle of my prescription depression medication (Paxil). Everything felt entirely perfect. I was alone in my apartment, done with schooling, all of my friends had gone home, it felt right. But right as I went to get a glass of water, someone from my apartment complex knocked on my door. 

I answer the door (my Paxil bottle in my hand still) and there’s a girl I’ve seen once or twice around. She says “hey (my name), all my roommates are gone and I was wondering if you just wanted to watch a movie. I’m an extrovert so I just feel weird doing stuff alone.” 
I don’t think she knew what was happening, but in that moment it felt like it was some sort of sign from God. Like maybe God or the universe or whatever is out there does want me alive, even though everything seems awful right now. After she left I sobbed and it felt like everything just changed— like a light switch went off. 

When I go home I’m going to check into a psych ward and get the help I’ve been procrastinating on getting. I’m going to start eating more again and try to recover from my eating disorder, and remember what happened tonight. 

The timing of everything that happened tonight wasn’t a coincidence at all. "
i catch myself wanting to go “home” but not knowing where that even is,"i catch myself saying it in a room of people, at work, while driving, while in my bed, while eating in a restaurant. doesn’t matter where. it’s just always playing in my mind. i’ve never really felt at home anywhere, and i hate saying it because of that."
"PSA from the mod team: Please don't report posts just because they seem high-risk to you, thanks.","We've had a sudden uptick of anonymous people (or possibly one energetic person) clicking ""report"" and specifying something like ""viable threat of self-harm"" as the report reason.  We have no idea what the motivation is for these reports, but this is a dangerous and ill-advised practice for the following reasons:

1. Reporting a post increases the probability that it will be snagged by the reddit spam filter.  This is entirely outside the moderators' control.

2. The criteria for these reports seem to be pretty random, and [do not correspond to established, evidence-based risk assessment criteria](http://redd.it/1c7nqf).

3.  Most of the reported posts have had some good, supportive responses, so there doesn't appear to be any special action warranted on the part of the moderators.  

4.  What it says in the sidebar is true - we don't have the resources to trace the source of any post, but we fear that this is what our anonymous reporter is expecting.  So we'd like to point out that ""outing"" someone can actually increase the inherent risk in a situation rather than decreasing it, especially in the long term, by discouraging them from opening up about their feelings.  Involuntary interventions are almost never necessary, and almost always traumatic.  It's important to remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention.  It saves far more lives than it costs.  The times when outing someone is the safer choice are the rare exceptions, as when someone gets entangled in a safety harness and needs to be cut out of it.

Attempted suicide two years ago. Just got Facebook timeline and saw something...,"I attempted to kill myself in my college dorm a little over two years ago.

It wasn't much of a suicide attempt as it was a, ""Hey, I'm gonna do this, and if it happens to kill me, whatever."" I was unconscious for over 24 hours. My roommate was the only person who knew at the time. I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills. It was a spur of the moment decision and I had convinced myself that I wasn't doing anything wrong and just wanted to make myself be happy and pass out. Two days later I could barely move, my head was pounding, my heart was pounding, and it was hard to breathe. I may very well have taken a lethal dosage and lived for no good goddamn reason.

I don't remember much of that semester, or really that whole year. So I was surprised to find some Facebook posts just today.

Looking back, I posted every day. Something. Oftentimes a little cry for help, even if it sounded silly. And then, there was a three-day period where I posted nothing. I knew immediately what those three days were. But there was one post on my wall... it was from my sister...

"" Brudder! Are you alive? :) ""

Holy shit.

I read that today and it just ripped me apart to think that when I was about to die, my sister was thinking about me. I chose to wear a blindfold of self-pity and tried to convince myself no one cared. Don't be a fucking idiot like I was. If I had killed myself, I would have killed my sister, and plenty of other people, too.

If you want to be selfish, be selfish enough to get help.

I hope someone reads this and gets something out of it. My sister and the rest of my family still have no idea this ever happened.

**tl;dr - Sister jokingly asked if I was still alive after I almost killed myself.**"
Sometimes I wish something tragic would happen in my life so I have a reason to justify my depression.,"It’s fucked up thinking I know but I just got these weird af scenarios in my head and I know it ain’t right. 

I know I don’t have enough to be sad about even tho I know that’s not how it works."
Why do people freak out so much when they find out you want to die?,"It’s an honest question. Like, it’s hard to believe there are actually people on this planet who think life is worth living. I honestly can't wait until I don't exist anymore..."
"""Committing suicide would be selfish, because it's making your loved ones live in pain for the rest of their lives just so you won't have to suffer."" Uh, so then aren't you pretty selfish for forcing ME to live in pain for my entire life just so YOU won't have to suffer?","sorry for title gore - I'm getting so sick of my being suicidal automatically being attacked with accusations of being selfish, because of how much it will affect the people around me if I did it - which, by the way, is pretty much the only fucking reason I'm still here. I've been suffering for a long time, the only reason I'm putting up with it and haven't just killed myself already is basically for my family. So they won't have to find my body, so I won't leave the couple of friends I have alone, so no one else will have to suffer like I'm being forced to. But no, yeah, I'M the selfish one.

I don't WANT to live anymore. You're the fucking selfish one for forcing me to just for your own fucking happiness when I've been telling you for years that I am not. Happy. It hurts. It really hurts. If you truly loved me, you would let me end it."
Goodbye I guess <3,"Hey Reddit,

The internet is a scary place however real life isn't much better. I like Reddit because it is mostly anonymous, you could be my best friend, my cousin, my brother and not know whose post you were reading and I like that because some things you just don't want people to know. People in my life know I'm falling apart but they don't know quite how bad it is, how messed up and broken I am I mean fuck, they thought I was over everything that happened a few years ago but little do they know it still catches up to me every once in a while, makes me break down crying. Anyways, I feel like on Reddit it's hard to picture users as actual people so I'll set the scene slightly. Hey, I'm Scarlett and I'm currently living in the UK. I suffer from a lot of mental illnesses and honestly I've grown up ignoring my diagnosises because if I'm being honest, I don't care. My friends have no idea that I suffer from bipolar either and it's fucking hard to keep that one to yourself but I'm trying my best. It feels like every day i feel worse and worse and I just hurt myself more and more. I don't really see a point for me to carry on anymore, I'm a burden to every one I know and I'm so fucking greatful that they put up with my shit And smile even though they have their own stuff going on and I just wanted to say thank you. There are so many reasons I don't want to be here anymore but in reality, does it even matter what the reasons are? I don't plan on living much longer and if I don't have time to write a note then I guess this is it. I'm sorry for wasting your time, hope you are all having a nice day, and remember, it may be too late for me, I have made up my mind but life is beautiful and I hope that whatever your going through, you find a way to get through it. 

Goodbye for now,

Scarlett x"
Wife cheated,"Using a throwaway acc cause friends know my main 

So my wife cheated on me, after 6 years of marriage I found out she was cheating for 4 of those years so that's amazing isn't it? 

I remember when I was younger I used to tell my mum that if I was ever cheated on I would probably kill myself, I see now it was a fucked up thing to say to my own mum but it's irony isn't it. 

How it's all came back to bite my arse. I guess I'm just typing this to get my last few words out tbh, I guess I kinda predicted what would happen to me. 

In all honestly I don't know what to do, what to say or even how to feel. The thing that hurts the most is my wife knew about all my depression and how when I was younger I was suicidal but of course never went through with it as I believed that there was light at the end of that tunnel. 

But look now, I guess what tunnel collapsed. Holy fuck I'm just so depressed and broken.

I'm not looking for attention, I just want someone to read my last few words. Strange isn't it, how strangers can care more for you than those close to you. 

Goodbye"
Failure,"I can never do anything right. All I ever do it mess up and fail. So what's the point of trying? 

I'm a pathetic excuse for a human being, I can't do anything. I can't do taxes, my life is in shambles, I'm disgustingly overweight, I'm dumb and boring. I just don't have anything going for me. I'm as empty and hollow as a doll. I'd be better off that way. Because as a human I'm a failure and always will be."
Is it possible that I'm just too lazy for life?,"That's it. I feel I'm just too lazy for life. I have lost motivation and interest in everything. I'm not looking forward for future at all and I don't enjoy living.

I don't know what is so wrong with me. I force myself to do things I have to do, exercise on regular basis, although all I want to do is just sleep or lock myself in a room without seeing anyone. But even I force myself, motivation still doesn't come. It's like I have lost interest in life.

I'm very tired of putting on a mask to hide how disfunctional I actually am. I need to constantly pretend that I care and I'm interested in everything, or that I'm present while I'm doing something when my mind just can't stop imagining about death every single moment. 

I don't think I will be able to do suicide because my parents would be too traumatized by it, but I honestly don't know how long I can keep going and I welcome death, or if there was a dangerous situation that could lead me to death, I probably won't escape.

It's like I'm existing but I'm already dead. I feel so inhuman."
Everyone in my family I cared about is dead at 19 and anxiety is making me want to die.,"My dad was an alcoholic and killed himself when I was 10. My uncle who was like a father figure to me died of cancer when I was 13. My grandpa who was also like a father figure to me died of a major artery burst when I was 16. My mom was very mentally ill, she attempted suicide many times throughout my life since I was a kid and in some ways she was emotionally abusive to me but I still cared about her and she died of cancer last march, I'm 19. I'm living on my own now and have to pay bills but the problem is I have nearly crippling anxiety which makes it hard to work because almost everytime I go in the whole time I have really bad anxiety and keep having the thought repeat in my head that I'd rather kill myself than continue feeling like this. I've been working for 3 weeks now and almost everyday I've burst into tears while working. For the last month I've spent every day wandering whether or not I should kill myself I really enjoy living and for now I'm too scared to kill myself but anxiety is a cunt."
"No job, no friends, and family that sees me as a disappointment.","I know these type of posts are seen all the time so I don’t expect a lot of interaction with mine. I just need a place to vent since I really have no one else to go to. I’ve felt like a loner for years now but I’m at my absolute lowest at the moment. The one companion of mine that I had for almost 8 years, my dog, passed away last month. I always said I wouldn’t kill myself as long as he was here with me and now that he’s gone I see no other reason to keep going. I graduated from college this past December and haven’t been able to land a job since. Most days I just sit and play video games because I just get so angry at all the rejection from employers who say they’re hiring for entry level but require 2+ years of experience. I don’t have any skills. I tried to learn programming but honestly I’m just not very tech savy and I just don’t have enough time to learn before my situation gets worse. I feel like I’ve let my family down, especially my grandma and mom who sacrificed so much to get me to college. Killing myself would just be doing them a favor. At least I would no longer be a burden. The people I thought were my friends grew up and got lives and just abandoned me in the process. Only things that seems to keep me somewhat happy are sex and alcohol. I don’t see myself being the type of person to commit suicide by hanging or an overdose but honestly if the rampant sex with strangers won’t kill me, the alcohol poisoning sure will. 🙃"
"I hung myself, but woke up on the floor.","I tried to hang myself with a belt two days ago.  I blacked out and woke up on the floor.  The leather around my belt buckle broke.   I don't know how long I was unconscious, but I must have hit my head and hip very hard when I fell.   I have some broken blood vessels in my left eye.  I have no one to talk to about this.  I don't know how I feel about it.   I'm not feeling any relief that it didn't work.   "
My dog stopped me,"I changed all my emergency contact info from my parents to someone else months ago. This way my school and local police department would never know who my guardians were. Today has been the hardest day in the past few months. A situation that happened to me when I was 15 happened to me again today. I already have really bad ptsd. So today made it worse. 

I cut myself for the first time in a long time. But I did it vertically this time. I tried to kill myself but my dog came up next to me and tried to lick my hands. I love him more than anything. I want him to never experience pain or sadness. I want my dog to have the best life fucking possible. He’s the only reason I didn’t kill myself tonight. "
There was a Double Murder/Suicide in My Family Last Night. TRIGGER WARNING.,"⚠️ Trigger Warning ⚠️ 
Murder, Suicide, Gun violence, child involved, cheating, news making a mockery of tragedy.
Names are all fake.

I (25F) have two younger brothers. We (me, Mike (23M), and Max (17M) all have different fathers. We’ve never lived with Mike’s dad, but he’s been a father figure to us throughout our lives.

Now comes the awfulness.

Last night one of my father figures, did a terrible thing. He shot and murdered two people, and then he turned the gun on himself.

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

- - - - - 

“Dan” was a good person. He was a great biological father to my middle brother “Mike”, his other 3 children, and a father figure to me as Mike’s older sister. I was a 10 month old baby when Dan met my mom. A little over a year later, my little brother Mike (age 23) came along. Dan (60s) and my mom (40s) didn’t stay together, but he was always good to us throughout our lives.

And then this.

Dan had a long-term girlfriend, “Rachel”. Dan recently found out that Rachel has been cheating on him for a period of time, and last night he hit his absolute breaking point. Dan wanted Rachel out of his house, and she refused to go. Apparently she paraded around in front of him, wearing the sweater of the man she’s with on the side; basically flaunting the cheating and telling Dan that he’s becoming an old man, that she can do better, have any guy she wants, but due to current circumstances he has to let her stay and support her. She’s telling him all of this, meanwhile my father figure is trying to keep his temper. He tells her to get the hell out of the house. He tells her that he’s had enough. We can tell he’s losing control at this point.

That’s when Dan’s older son Bill (age 26 and Mike’s biological big brother) gets in the middle. Bill tries to settle his father down, and get Rachel to shut up because everyone can tell Dan is at his boiling point. They don’t. At this point, Bill says he has had enough and is going to take his girlfriend and his 3 year old son “Eli” and move out and leave the house, because they can’t stand the fighting. Because they need to support Eli, Bill and Megan were going to move out anyway. Bill hoped that this would snap them to their senses; but Dan tells him to go. Bill leaves.

That’s when things got worse. 

Rachel keeps screaming and taunting Dan. The others are scared and frozen. Dan pushes Rachel into the wall, and starts hurting her. Megan calls Rachel’s brother because Dan is getting violent and everyone is terrified but scared to get in the way. Rachel’s hitting Dan and scratching at him; screaming she doesn’t love him and he has no right to touch her, that she has every right to be here as Dan is grabbing at her, shoving her into the wall and towards the door. Megan calls Rachel’s brother for help, because the situation is deteriorating and we are all afraid Dan will really hurt her because he’s much bigger.

Rachel’s brother gets there instantly from a few doors down. The brother gets in the middle, taking Rachel’s side, defending her actions. It doesn’t help. Dan leaves the room fuming....we’d never seen him so angry.....and comes back with a shotgun loaded. 

The first shot goes off, and hits Rachel in the stomach. She collapsed with blood everywhere, Megan grabs baby Eli and runs upstairs; and Rachel’s brother runs for the door. He makes it out of the house and partway down the drive, into his van, before Dan shoots him in the chest and he dies instantly. Then....then Dan comes back into the living room. He levels the shotgun at himself.... and then shoots himself in the head.

Meanwhile, Megan has barricaded herself upstairs with the baby and calls Bill (the older son, and her boyfriend), and 911. The police run in and Bill gets there right about the same time; running inside to get his girlfriend and son. He’d only been gone for like 5 minutes. 

Just 5 minutes.

The police run in, and check on everyone. Rachel is still alive; so a Lifeflight is called in for her. We heard she died en route to the hospital in the helicopter. 

So basically....my little brother Mike’s dad and my father figure shot and murdered his girlfriend for cheating and pushing him to the brink, then chased her brother out of the house and shot and murdered him for trying to get in the middle of it; and then Dan shot himself in the head and killed himself. He murdered two people and committed suicide.

My little brother is an absolute mess. The news vans and newspapers are making a mockery of what happened, swarming like vultures wanting to use our tragedy for entertainment. Horrible sick people. Someone said something about publishing this in the paper, and one of the family members nearly got arrested for punching the guy. Everyone is hysterical. 

The police have already ruled it a Murder/Suicide. 

My little brother Mike is a mess, my mom is a mess, and I’m trying so hard to be strong. Mike can’t understand why his father would do that. Why he’d shoot two people and then turn the gun on himself....taking the cowards way out. The suicide was so brutal that the police would not allow the family to identify the body. 

Luckily, Mike’s older brother Bill, the girlfriend Megan, and little Eli is okay. But we are all damaged. How will anything ever be okay again? 

This is SENSELESS.

I’ve been awake all night at my moms comforting my brother and being with family. Now I’m collapsed at my fiancé’s, just taking it all in while he holds me tight. I’ve already put an email in to my therapist. Sorry about the crappy writing, and if this is difficult to understand; it’s a complicated situation and I’m barely functioning.

EDIT: The news story is out and apparently Rachel survived. She coded and died en route to the hospital, but apparently they eventually got her back. She’s alive, but in critical condition."
I always tell this board I’m going to kill myself...,"And I always really mean it when I post it. Then I wake up the next morning and feel okay again. Sometimes it takes a little longer. Maybe by the next afternoon. And then I delete my posts on here.

It’s better to post here than to tell someone I know in my life. Here, I’m just an anonymous weirdo that keeps crying wolf. Barely anyone even comments. 

Years ago I used to tell the people closest to me when I felt like this and it drove them away. It got me sent to a hospital and then stuck with a medical bill I couldn’t afford.

It’s better to just post and delete here. Just another name on this board. I’ll probably never really do it anyhow. "
"As of 1 hour ago, literally all my friends are dead.","All left me in 2016.

 My best friend was the first to go. She started doing heroin against my warnings. A week after her first time trying it, she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers. I remember the last text I got from her... 

Next was someone I reconnected with at her service. I hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. He never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew I would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.

Two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. His car flipped and his neck snapped on impact. 

This year has been emotional torment. I said I couldn't handle any more losses. Then an hour ago, I get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer... I can't do this anymore. I'm sick to my stomach. I'm all alone. I have literally no one to talk to... all the people I could find comfort in are gone... 

Maybe if there IS an afterlife I can see them again..."
It’s impossible to talk about suicide,People don’t wanna hear about it. Suicide lines are bs. If you do open up to someone they suddenly become responsible for your well being which is a difficult position to be in for them. It’s also emotionally draining to listen to someone talk about it. I feel like a burden because being suicidal makes me one.
Do you ever think about how wonderful it would have been to never have existed?,"No pain, no happiness, just nothing. 
I sometimes think about this universe and wish it never existed, so I don’t have any chance of reincarnation or after life.
Just for nothing... to have never experienced anything."
I want to go home,"I want to go home.

Not to a place in my mind I once knew. 

Not to my birthplace, or the town where I grew.

Not to my family that left me alone. 

Not to the land or the house that I own. 

Not to the West where my heart says I should be. 

Not to the places I would one day see.

Not to the bed where I lay down at night. 

Not to my “friends” who stay out of sight. 

Each day it gets harder and harder to stay.

Afraid to tell anyone the things I should say.

My mind has betrayed me like everything else.

I finally realize, I have to do it myself. 

The truth that I find so incredibly sad:

I have no home. Not like I once had.

I am tired. I am weak. I am angry. Alone. 

I have made up my mind...



I AM going home. "
Today I threw away my rope,"Throwaway since I don't really want this on my main account and I'm not sure if it belongs here. I wrote my suicide note yesterday and attempted suicide. I won't bore you with the details of that but it didn't work, don't think I did it right. This morning, I took my rope that I have (the only rope I had, specifically for that purpose) and I threw it in the trash. I ripped up my suicide note. I've told myself that I'm going to stay here and fight, even if I don't win, I'm going to give it a damn good go. 

It might seem rather insignificant, but throwing that rope away, the rope that was always there for me to use if I felt like it, is a big step for me. "
I made it to 15 :),Before on this subreddit I posted about how I was going to end it all in my birthday before I turned 15. Here I am though. Although my family situation hasn’t gotten a lot better there’s still proof that it’s going to get better over a course of a year or so. Anyways don’t mind this I just feel proud.
i hate how i actually have a decent life and i still despise myself,"i struggle to relate with the stories of people with actual depression struggling to get out of bed, have a shower, and do basic tasks. they often talk about how socially isolated they are, how they don't have any friends or family to turn to. 

i hate how i hate myself and how unhappy i am despite being none of the above. i actually have great friends and loving parents and im sure if i were to open up to them they would 100% listen to me and help me through my sadness. that's the worst part; i don't want anyone worrying about me. it would break my heart to think that my parents and friends, in the back of their minds, are constantly worrying about whether or not im going to kill myself.  

do you know how many late night texts ive drafted? how many times ive lied in bed crying myself to sleep, wishing desperately that i could tell someone how much i hate living? 

i don't even know what i want anymore. i have skills and hobbies. im doing well in school. i have meaningful relationships. it's like somewhere along my life, the part of me that could be happy left my side. i could have everything in the world, but ill never have self satisfaction."
I feel sucidal again.,i hate being suicidal. Should I call them?
I think my depression is finally passing.,"I've found a reason to live, I don't want to die anymore. And I'm beginning to enjoy the things I used to love before. I feel happy for once, not that numbness I felt for so long. It's been a difficult battle but I think I'm winning it."
Why is suicide so bad anyway?,"People keep trying to talk me out of it. I don't get why. They keep using different types of arguments, and I really don't believe in any of them.

Is it selfish because of the people who care about you? Well, how is me living a life I don't want to just to comfort their lives not selfish from them? Moreover, what about the people who have no one to care for them?(Not my case, but still, it's quite a common cause of suicide)

Is it cowardly? I really don't think so. Every little inch of your body tries to stop you from doing it, so coming to the decision, and moreover actually doing it takes a lot of courage and determination.

Do things get better? Well, what if they fucking DON'T? For years, I keep hoping to get to a better life, to start properly enjoying it, but it just doesn't work out. I even moved to a different country, hoping for a new(and better) life. Truth be told, I'm just not meant to live a good life. I don't know, maybe I was a massive asshole in a past life(if that's a thing) and now karma is working its way.

People are so hypocritical, I swear. They all use the ""my body, my choice"" argument to support transgender people(and more others, but this was the first that came into my mind), yet they fail to acknowledge that this principle works exactly the same for suicidal people. I never asked for this. If(well, obviously hypothetically speaking) I could have gotten a choice whether to be born or not, I might have just said no, so I should have a right to end my miserable existence whenever the hell I want. After all, I have a RIGHT to live, not an obligation to do so. Huge difference.

*edit*: In all fairness, I have to admit that there are situations in which suicide is kind of a dick move. For example, if you have children which still depend on you, killing yourself would more or less ruin their future. So yes, in that case, I disagree with suicide. However, I'm single and I don't have any kids(or any other person whose life depends on me other than myself), so offing myself would not affect anyone in the end."
Wanted to share this with you guys - I asked out a girl today,"(xpost from r/foreveraloneadating)

I was on the train to penn station and I saw a 10/10 girl reading a book and sat next to her. Along the way I asked ""good book?"" and she said yeah and told me about it. Then, when the train arrived, I said, ""I'm sorry but I have to ask I'll hate myself if I don't - you are absolutely gorgeous and you seem really nice; if I gave you my number would you give me a call?"" She said sure and took my number."
I've lost my son to suicide last week,"Hello humanity.

Last Thursday, my son Alex took his own life. He left no note and there was no indication of his intention to do this. Our family came together in this great sorrow.

I would like people to take away light from this event. Alex was 25. He was a beautiful and kind person that knew how to give but had difficulty in receiving.

We, all of us question what more we could have done to bring more love into his life, but we have no answers and we feel a profound sorrow at the loss of  this beautiful man.

Please, I ask that anyone just please take a breath if this is your contemplation and know that you are loved even if in your moment of despair in that dark place. Please find that you are love and that you have love to give in this world. There are still people, perhaps some you have not even met yet that need your love in their own life.

Know you are light and you shine farther than you yourself may be able to perceive. Know this. Take that breath. Find your peace in the love you have and the love you get.

Peace."
No throwaway account. It's me. I need help. The suicide hotline has been useless.,"I owe thousands of dollars.
I have been stabbed in the back by yet another person, worked fifty+ hours and got paid nothing and now I'm going to screw my best friend with no rent payment this month, or money for anything else.
But who gives a shit about money. Sure, I made a mistake working two months for no pay with someone else and am now screwed. (Different than above) Sure, the person I trusted most as a friend I just found out has been ripping me behind my back because she thinks I'm in love with her. 

The person I AM in love with, my ex-wife, has moved on, despite the fact that she promised a second chance after I took some time to fix myself and my problems. 

I have no job. No one. My family is utterly miserable and just judges everything that I do. I am 28 and cannot even afford the healthcare I need to take care of my MS, my collapsed ankles and my ADD which keeps me from focusing on anything. My hand is shaking like mad and I'm doing what I can to avoid painkillers.

I know it's completely stupid, but I find it hard to believe I'll ever find anyone who will love me as much as the two people I've screwed over. I'm out of options and pretty sure I'm at my limits.

I never went to Europe, never even went to the East Coast. If I believed in reincarnation or religion, I'd probably not be as worried, but at this point, I've got nothing left.

The suicide hotline was useless, my therapist is an idiot and I can't afford her anymore anyways, my friends are clueless and I'm out of options. Reddit is my last hope to maybe find someone to help me out. 

I just can't seem to find a reason for myself, yeah I know I'm insanely selfish, but I just can't seem to find a reason to stay here."
This may be really selfish but it's my opinion,"I've seen lots of people saying that if you die, the people around will be sad and angry at themselves etc.

 But the thing is: if I'm dead, I can't ""see"" or ""experience"" the repercussions of my death and I think I prefer that to feel like shit all the time. I know this is a awful way of thinking.
So yeah, I'm probably only still alive cause I dont have the courage to do anything.


P.S. English isn't my first language so please excuse any mistakes"
I'm actually excited about the corona virus and hope it kills me or changes life overall for the human race so my life isnt so fucking meaningless all the time.,"I know no one here really cares about this and that's not a surprise. In today's society, everyone is so fucking selfish. Seriously, everyone either cares about money or clout or both. I don't have either of those and I do envy those who are spoiled. My life isn't bad at all and in fact I have many more advantages than most people my age, but I still feel like theres no purpose. I get a degree from university. So what? then I have to work a boring ass fucking office job for years 8 hours a day only having some time on the weekends for a few hours? What is the fucking point. I swear it feels like a fucking prision. The only thing I semi enjoy is gaming but you can't make a career out of it today. and yes, I KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS NOT PROBABLE.  so don't give me that shit about ""just try"" like fuck off. 

Overall I honestly feel like theres no purpose in life. Like when thinking about killing myself I try to remember to before I was born and what it was like and I realize I can't remember anything because I didn't exist. It was like a void. The same will happen when I kill myself. no pain just a state of nothingness that we as humans can't even comphrend.

I don't know how to be happy when it seems everyone is better than me, they have goals and are doing stuff. I have no goals. I have no ambitions and don't care what anyone else thinks. One day I will find a way to end it but not today because im too much of a pussy. fml. 

also sorry about the grammar im not gonna edit it cause im a lazy shit."
"I went out last night, and you won't believe what happened. It has to be a sign...","I'm not religious.  I don't believe in supernatural things.  But is this a sign?

Yesterday was terrible for me.  Every day is now.  The only thing I have that makes my life worth living - my girlfriend - is about to be gone.

I don't have any friends or a social circle (literally zero friends or family). I've been trying to go out at night - maybe I can meet another girl the way I met my girlfriend.  Maybe I can stay alive.

I got downtown and started walking over towards the bars. That's when I saw something approaching me.  It was a huge group of people, running with flashing lights and all wearing the same shirts.   It's like they were running a marathon.

I asked someone what was going on, and that's when I saw their shirt.  It said ""one night.  One goal.  Stop suicide.""

They explained to me that it was a charity run to raise money for suicide prevention.  Is this not just a sign of something?  This is the darkest period of my life, and I've been through some shit.  But last night, when I decided to go out instead of hyperventilate and cry in my apartment, that's what I came across."
To those saying 'you'll hurt so many people by dying',"Look, pal. I've got nobody. I've celebrated both my 18th, and 20th (and many more) birthdays alone, crying my guts out. 

Never have I ever had a boyfriend of any sorts, boys wouldn't even try to bully me from a distance.

My childhood best friend hasn't chatted with me in years and the only encounters we have are extremely awkward and unpleasant. 

My parents both have depression and are mostly emotionless creatures who never listen to what I have to say. They love watching TV and sitting at home. My mom thinks I'm autistic. 

My classmates show me pity sometimes, but jump out of the train whenever I try to communicate with them like normal people.

I'm sick and tired of 'behaving myself' so others would be happy that I don't cause any trouble.

I pray every single day I get cancer so at least somebody (doctors) would care about me for a bit before I finally die. Sometimes I dream of losing a limb, or ending up in a wheelchair, but I just don't care. If that happened I would no longer have to try to pretend to be useful.

I just wish, so very badly, to just disappear. Everyone hates me and I hate me. And I want to die."
I write this on my way to the top of a building.,"As I look out over the cityscape. I feel like I should apologize. Smoking a cigarette, listening to music, I feel free here. This sight is wonderful. 


To my best friend; I'm going to miss you. I'm so sorry about this. I love you immensely and always stay true to who you are because I want you to live for you. I know you get caught up in other people sometimes, and that's fine. Be yourself always. 


To my other very close and best friends, I love you all too, and the amount of stuff you have all supported me through has been immense. Thank you for being there. 


To my mum: I love you mum, I couldn't have asked for a stronger, or better role model. Please forgive me. 


To my dad: please finish the project car, for both of us. I know you might not want to after I'm gone but I want you to do it for us. 


To my brother, make sure your daughter grows up safe. I care about her. I care about you, please stay strong. 


To my other family: thank you all. 


To the people that contributed to this: fuck you. I'll never escape the torment that you put me through. The pain, the uncertainty, making me feel like I'm no longer me. Fuck you for making me feel this way. Fuck you.

"Thank you, Reddit, for keeping me alive","There's a lot of pain and sadness here, but there's also a lot of hope and a lot of people who genuinely care. More than most of the therapists I've ever had, to be honest. No one here is going to commit you to a hospital, or rat you out to your boss, or tell you to just cheer up and take a Zumba class \(seriously, I wish I were making that last one up\).

I came here a year ago because I wanted to kill myself. I spent a year here thinking about it. I've spent the past two months deciding that I \-don't\- want to kill myself. Someday in the future maybe I'll swing back to wanting it. You know what? No matter what, I'll always have this place to write my thoughts down, and I'll always have people here who will listen to my stupid problems. All that money spent on therapy and meds and the place that made me not want to kill myself was right here for free. Go figure.

I wish that the guy who killed himself two months ago \(would post his user name but I assume rules won't allow for that\) was here to read this. That his posts got me on this path in the first place. I hope he's at peace now, anyway. 

To everyone else, please keep on posting and replying to things. You're all fucking amazing. "
I wish I could be legally euthanized,"I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar subtype. Medication works for me only some of the time, and the side effects make it so that even when I am sane I am trapped in a state of joyless sedated apathy. Antipsychotics took every last little bit of imagination and happiness I had left and now I am a shell who literally goes to work, comes home, and stares at the wall until I can fall asleep. I am 25 and have been sick for over 10 years now - how am I supposed to keep going for another 40 years like this, poor, barely able to work, still surrounded by hallucinations on the regular because the horrible medications don't even work properly on me. If I take my meds, life becomes a chore that offers no relief. If I don't take my meds, I have crazy states of mania and hallucinations and end up jobless and alone. I feel like this illness stole everything from me. I wish I could go to the doctor and tell them, I am incurably mentally ill and I would like to die, and be offered an option for a peaceful death. I wish that there was an end to this suffering."
"I lied to my therapist, I’m just done, and at this point I don’t think I can be talked out of it, you can’t save people that don’t want to be saved. I just want someone to know.","I don’t think anyone will read this, but if you do, thanks. Throwaway account for privacy. 

I know people will think I’m posting this because I still have some shred of hope or some part of me wants to live, but that’s not it, like I said, I don’t think anyone can talk me out of it now, I just want someone to know, everyone on this sub is completely disconnected from me personally, and that makes me feel better. 
I’m young, 17, and I understand there’s so many years that I could have, I just don’t want them. I’ve contemplated suicide a few times over the years, I’m sure everyone has, but it was always a fleeting thought, now it’s constant. 
I just lost a parent, I’m in so much pain, not just mental, mostly physical actually. I live with health conditions that leave me in pain every second of every day, no matter what I do. The odd thing is, I’m not depressed, I deal with crippling anxiety, but not so much depression. 
I’ve been in therapy for a couple years now, she’s an amazing therapist, I genuinely couldn’t ask for anything more, she has tried very hard. The only time I’ve ever admitted wanting to die is last week, I regretted saying it immediately, she asked a couple questions, I answered honestly but told her I didn’t want to say anything else as I was scared she would tell my mother and I would be committed. She said she didn’t have to break confidentiality unless she suspected I was a danger to myself, doing things like stockpiling, planning etc. 
so obviously I didn’t admit that I had been doing those things, because I don’t want to be stopped. 
I honestly don’t understand why we try so hard to save people that don’t want to be saved. If someone wants to die, and they are so determined that they will do whatever it takes to make it happen, let them do it. At least they’d be able to go out with some shred of dignity. I’ve set a date to do it multiple times, and then backed out at the last minute, but tonight’s the night, I’m done backing out. I was scared this morning, and then counted how much I had stockpiled and was suddenly so relieved and for the first time in a while, felt excited. I can’t wait to go to sleep and not have to wake up resentful that I’m waking up. 
I feel bad that my family will have to find me, but not bad enough that I’m not going to do it. 
I don’t really want to die, but I don’t want to live in this pain either. I’ve weighed the pros and cons, and dying just outweighs living for me. 
Thank you for reading, I hope everyone else on here can find peace with whatever decision they make."
"I feel pathetic for posting this, but I’m gonna try to go to sleep, and it would mean a lot to me just to have a few nice comments when I wake up. It doesn’t have to be much, but if you could just say something that would be awesome. I just want to feel like someone cares. It’s been a bad night. :(","Edit: Thank you everyone who reached out to me last night :’) If I had the energy, I would reply to every single message I got. I really appreciate y’all’s support and I’m gonna try to make each day better than the last!"
Is anyone else not able to cry?,"A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't bottle up or hide my emotions, because that would only makes things worse, and that I should express what I'm feeling. But the problem is I have nothing to express or bottle up, I don't feel anything. Nothing makes me happy or excited anymore, although I've gotten pretty good at faking it so people around me don't realize just how dead I am inside. I don't feel sad ever either. Things happen that should make me sad or any other emotion but there's nothing there. I feel like I should feel something, but I don't. I'm just so desensitized to it all I just don't care anymore. And I know I should cry, and Ive tried, but I can't. Nothing happens. I'm just there, as dead as ever with no tears or emotions or anything. At night, when I lay awake, im just blank. I just want to feel something again even if its sadness because I can't keep going feeling so empty inside."
Wish I could press a button to die instantly,Killing yourself is so much work
Zero motivation to live but zero motivation to die. Just kinda want to not exist but not die at the same time?,"I dont know if that makes sense. Feeling massively depressed for most of my life growing up and I feel like even if I get over depression I won't get over trauma I experienced which sorta still creeps up on me. At times I wish i could disappear cause I feel it wouldn't matter, but I can't make myself do it cause i know itd hurt people even if I tell myself they wouldn't bother. 


I get by by just sorta blocking these feelings and depersonalizing to the point it doesnt hit me but it leaves me feeling totally dead inside which I guess is why id rather not be alive cause it doesnt feel like im living yknow?

The only time I feel something genuinely is when I hurt myself but it leaves my face bruised and its hard to make up excuses when people ask but sometimes I wish someone would ask about it genuinely because its draining feeling this disconnected from the world and myself and im too afraid to find help so it just eats away at me"
Stop promoting the stupid ass hotlines. They suck.,I honestly want to off myself even more when I see them. Horrible service overall and they have no fucking idea what they're doing most of the time. Hats off to them for trying though.
My brother killed himself and I am about to do the same thing,"This is the short version of my story 
So I had an older brother. I had one. He was always depressed. He even tried to kill him self but he was stopped my parents. That happened about 2 years ago (I was 14, I’ve recently turned 16). One month later he somehow got my fathers gun, a shotgun. He then shot him self in the head. I rushed to his room and saw his exploded head. Since then I’ve never said a word and now im not able to speak anymore (im mute because of the trauma, its called selective mutism if you want to look it up.) and I am extremely depressed. Everytime I close my eyes I see the image of my dead brother with his head blown off. I have multiple panic attacks everyday. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family(by „talk“ I mean communicate not literally talk.). I can’t do this anymore. Im sitting with a knife next to me. I don’t know if I should do it. 

Please help me

Edit: thank you all for being so positive, it helped. I put the knife away and I will try to sleep for a bit.

Thanks to each and every single one of you

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold.
I also want to thank every person that has offered me to talk with them, I really appreciate it.

Im sorry for bothering you guys

Edit 3: its bad. I had a panic attack and cut myself. 

Edit 4: a day since posting. Im still alive but not in a good state

Edit 5: still alive, my parents will be home tomorrow I will talk to them about therapy 

Edit 6: This is the final edit. I tried to kill myself.
I cut myself pretty bad and almost died. im okay now and im going to therapy. Thanks for the support."
My best friend of ~18 years is engaged to the man who sexually assaulted me,"I have always had a shitty life but this just takes the cake. 
In 2016 I was raped. It was the hardest time in my life, and I attempted suicide then. Clearly I survived and am still here. 
Tonight I just found out that the girl who I’ve been best friends with since we were in elementary is engaged to the boy who raped me. 
And yes she knows he raped me. She is very aware of the fact. 
It turns out she has been hooking up with him since my assault.  And they are now engaged. She’s somehow kept it a secret from me (I’ve moved away for college so we don’t see each other every day like we used to) but she accidentally forgot to untag herself from a post and so I saw a post of the two of them together in Facebook. 
This is the girl who calls me her sister, says she loves me more than anyone, tells me she’ll always be there for me. 

So it hit me tonight. No one actually fucking cares about me. Clearly not. The person who claimed to have cared the most about me is marrying the man who ruined my life. 
I feel like it’s 2016 all over again. I feel like all progress I’ve made is lost and I’m back right where I was. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow morning. I don’t know how to pretend everything’s fine anymore. "
Update:I told my mom,"If you look on my profile you’ll see my post earlier on this sub about being suicidal. It finally overpowered me and I told my mom. She told me that she loves me and that I’m gonna be happy again. We might go to a therapist soon. 
I’m also still talking to that girl and we’re both getting closer and dealing with this fucked up world together. Thanks so much for your advice guys, you saved my fucking life. I love you guys and I’m trying to love life again."
"Death isn't the worst thing, waking up and realizing you're constantly in pain is.","Can't even find the motivation to do anything anymore because my brain tries to pretend everything is alright, that stupid piece of shit. I have to make myself feel like crap in order to try and get anything done. I don't want to feel pain anymore. I've always told myself I'd make it out of this, that I'd live an enjoyable life after all, but I realize nothing is set in stone. "
It's so much harder to kill yourself than they make it seem.,"Or maybe I'm just not trying hard enough.

I don't want to do this anymore."
My wife's boyfriend told me to kill myself,"My wife left me in September after 8 years of marriage. This last Saturday, I received a phone call from my wife's number. When I picked up, there was a man's voice on the other end. The first question he asked was why I hadn't already killed myself. I was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. He kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if I did so. He told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. I haven't seen them since September. They are only 7 and 6. He said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because I am over 200 miles away from them. On Sunday, November 12th, I attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication. Before I was fully unconscious, my sister stopped by because she hadn't heard from me in over a day. When I came to, I was in the trauma unit upside down with tubes in my nose and neck, one pumping the contents of my stomach out, while the other was desperately pumping dopamine into my bloodstream. After spending 48 hours in the ICU, I'm home. I have an appointment on the 22nd of November with a therapist and a doctor, but I don't think that's soon enough. I'm scared. And ashamed. And I feel even more alone. I miss my wife and my children dearly. Which makes this so difficult to comprehend. I still can't believe that someone could say that to another human being. It cut deeper than any wound I could possibly imagine."
Why is it so fucking difficult to die?,"I never wanted to exist. I want to die. There isn't anything in this world that's going to change my mind. I don't want to get better. My mental and physical illness might actually be curable but I don't want to get better. I never enjoyed life and the only reason I am alive is simply due to my parents' selfishness and their decision to bring this misery upon me. I never asked to be born and no, life isn't a 'gift'. Life is pain, misery and dread.

I am too much of a coward man. I tried to take my life once but didn't do any research on my method so obviously, as you can see, I failed tremendously. I took a bunch of Xanax pills and downed them with alcohol hoping they'll make me go into cardiac arrest or maybe make me stop breathing...a simple google search would've saved me some time, because you need HUGE amounts of benzos in order to overdose and die...yet I went through it because it was an impulse decision so not much thought was put into it.

I woke up with a terrible headache and in a pile of vomit. I wish I had the courage to attempt it again, in a different way, but I'm too much of a pussy. That failed attempt disappointed me so much because it proved me that I'm such a failure that I can't even kill myself. I've been researching suicide methods ever since, but I just can't bring myself to do it, yet I somehow will. I need to.

&nbsp;

Looked up every single suicide method. Most of them have a high chance of survival and it can leave you crippled and even more miserable. Others, will leave you in agonizing pain for a few minutes or even hours before you die and I just don't have the guts to go for it. I am a huge coward. Who knows, maybe I'm just not ready to kill myself yet, as much as I want it??? Possibly.

Jumping in front of a train? Nope, there's a chance of living through it and suffering 100 times more. Jumping off a building? Literally same. If you're unlucky, you can jump off a skyscraper and survive (there's an actual story of some dude who fell off a 47-floor building and survived). Shooting my brains out would probably be my best deal but since I live in a shithole of a country in Eastern Europe, it's nearly impossible for me to get a gun. I'm currently doing some research on hanging since it's the most accessible and inexpensive suicide method out there and I've read that you can calculate the height of your jump in order to break off your spinal cord and die instantly. But if you miscalculate, you will either end up decapitated or you'll be awake and conscious through the whole thing and it can take you 15 minutes of unbearable pain to finally succumb to hanging. Overdosing on pills? I can't think of anything besides opiates since everything else will just fuck you up even more without actually killing you.

So what am I left with? Oh yes, opiates. Good old heroin. There's stories on the web from people who have survived heroin ODs and said that it was absolute bliss. You just go in a deep sleep and (hopefully) don't wake up. No hallucinations or paranoia or shit that you'd experience with other types of drugs. Just peace. 


&nbsp;

So I started to look for a heroin plug in my area. It's not easy living in a small city because you're out of luck. At some point, I was so desperate that I stopped giving a fuck about the risks involved and I just straight up started questioning people if they knew any heroin dealers in the area. I was met with surprised reactions, some were weirded out, some were concerned. Luckily, I'm not in prison so lucky me I guess, would be a shame to run into an undercover cop or something. Long story short, I couldn't find a dealer for the love of me. So here I am, browsing the darknet.

It took me a few weeks to learn the ropes. There's special software like Tails, Tor, PGP/Kleopatra, and the bitcoin wallet of choice. Still, no one will actually guarantee that you don't get scammed. I'm still struggling with the actual encryption of the messages so that I won't get in trouble. It fucking sucks. I just want to die and I can't understand all the unnecessary struggle I need to undergo. I wish it were as simple as going to the hospital, signing a paper and asking for a lethal shot. Yet, only a few countries around the world have legalized euthanasia and it fucking blows. I didn't choose to come into this life so why am I forced to stay?

I can't find anyone who is willing to fucking help. I have tried reaching out online, both on the clearnet and the darknet and all the feedback I've received was from people who ""want me to get better"". Why the fuck does everyone attach this special value to life? Why does everyone care about a random stranger's death so much? I don't want to live, is it a crime to hate life? It certainly seems so.

&nbsp;

There's so much stuff I'm going to risk. I thing I have found a potential vendor on the darknet who has great reviews and feedback. I'm going to order from him as soon as I figure out how to convert real money into cryptocurrency. I might just wake up with the cops knocking on my door, who knows? Maybe my pack will get seized. I might be thrown in jail since my country has stupid drug laws. Even if I DO get my hands on heroin, I know nothing about it. I don't know how to shoot up and missing a vein can lead to amputation. Can you freaking believe it? You're trying to off yourself but instead you end up with an amputated arm. Amazing. I know nothing about how to cook the heroin, how to shoot it up and how much to take. I know nothing about the purity of heroin and I might end up with some shit grade heroin that isn't going to kill me anyway. There's no fucking way to die peacefully. But anyway, I'll go through this. Not sure why I even wrote this, just needed to vent I guess.

&nbsp;

Wish me luck."
I will forever resent everyone who told me it gets better.,"I will forever resent those who told me to wait because I was young. Because ""it gets so much better once you're done with school!""

I will forever have deep hatred for those who told me to just go to therapy, get on meds, get professional help. Idk how the fuck it could ever help anyone but sure as the blood on the crucible it never helped me.

I fucking hate empty platitudes.

I fucking hate false promises.

It doesn't get better. And I'm far too weak, tired and lonely to keep pretending that it will.

Fuck you."
Someone help me," Tbh,I kinda feel very sorry for myself. Idk why,I just don’t believe it tbh. Until the end of the day I said today’s my birthday to someone else and everyone then said happy birthday,but it’s worthless to me now. I got surprised with cake and some gift cards but they personally didn’t make me happy. Yes I was happy but it just...idk just made me feel worthless sometimes. I got a reason why...I’ve done some bad in my life and they accept me for that,they don’t accept me as a friend,they only accept me as a weirdo and a annoying loser. I’ll accept my fate and be a statistic after all. I have ambitions that are not good and aren’t that ambitious at all....so yeah.I need motivation and training. ☹️"
"""Killing yourself is SELFISH""","You might've heard this when mentioning suicide to somebody, or talking about it. Maybe you even said it to someone else if you're not suicidal. I'll make this clear, IT'S FUCKING RUDE! Seriously, what is insulting a suicidal person gonna do? I'll tell you what it won't do, it won't pull them away from the edge. I had a friend who was at the bottom point, where they could hardly do anything, and they spent 2 months in a hospital due to brain damage from asphyxiation, and even longer in a different hospital while they took medicine and rehabilitation courses. I asked them years later what pushed them too far during a conversation about it, and they said ""I kept hearing how selfish I was being, and I hated it and it just made me want to do it more and more. I only pulled back when they stopped saying that, (a doctor) told my family to stop saying it because it was untrue, and I felt a relief knowing he knew better than they did, and he knew it wasn't selfishness to me..."" He went on for a while. I wish I took more of it to heart though, maybe I wouldn't feel so bad."
Anyone else feeling like they never truly connect with anyone?,"Like you're so distanced and can never truly be there, not just in relationships but with everything as whole. Feel really truly alone. Even if i have friends I still feel alone. "
It is Likely that I’ll lose my Husband to suicide.,"We’ve been married 12 years and have 4 kids. He attempted suicide once, before we met. I should also note his father committed suicide when he was a baby. He’s been honest since we met about his mental health and I knew it was risky choosing to spend my life with him, but I was in love and naïvely thought depression could be conquered. 
Fast forward to present, my husband works in mental and behavioral health, he is very successful (constant stream of referrals to see him) He wants to help others find their way out of the darkness he often finds himself in. We’ve had lots of ups and downs with depression over the years. This Past Fall was the worst, he took a leave of absence and then ended up quitting his job. He was really down for a few months.  Finally we tried a Ketamine infusion series which worked really well. But slowly over the last few weeks the depression has come back. We tried a Ketamine treatment yesterday, but it hasn’t helped much.
He told me last night that he’s done fighting. Life is just too hard. 
I felt like in the fall I had started preparing myself for the fact that I might lose him. I was seeing a great therapist at the time, and she really helped me. But right now we dont have health insurance and financially can’t afford therapy. 
No one else really knows the extent of His depression. I feel selfish wanting him to stay, because I know he’s hurting so much, and so tired of fighting, i want peace for him no matter what that means. However the reality is if he leaves us it will devastate this family, emotionally, and financially, and I have to think about those things because I will be responsible for all the pieces, and helping our kids navigate life without their Dad. And I cannot imagine life without my soul mate. I don’t know what to do or say anymore.  I feel so scared and alone.

** thank you so much for all of your kind words, and support. This is my first post and first I thought it didn’t work, but it was therapeutic to write down how I was feeling. 

I know it sounds like I’m giving up, but truly I will fight with him as long as he wants. He knows this. He also has taught me that suicide is not the selfish act so many view it as. Depression/mental illness can truly be a terminal disease and deserves the same respect and care as terminal disease. (In my opinion) 

So I’m trying to come to terms with what might be a reality for me. 

That said, I will never regret choosing him. everyone has struggles, and depression has been the biggest one we’ve fought together. Working in mental health he has saved many lives and helped many learn to thrive in their circumstances. He’s overcome a million obstacles and been the best example to others! 

And we have a beautiful family. We have kids who understand how their brains work, and how to be compassionate. They know that their feelings and the feelings of others, no matter what they are are, valid. My kids know love and acceptance of others is the greatest virtue they can have. My husband has taught us all so many things, I am a better person, and parent because of him. And this won’t change regardless of when his battle ends. 

And for those who haven’t had someone validate their feelings of wanting to move beyond this life, just know I hear you. Keep talking to your loved ones, it is a hard thing to hear and understand if you’ve never felt that way yourself, but I am proof, it’s possible."
Why is there no euthanasia for depressed people?,"It seems crazy to me that you can’t opt for assisted suicide if you’re depressed.
Even if there was a mandatory period of therapy or anti depressants etc before.
At one point there’s just little that seems worth trying, and it doesn’t seem fair to try and force people to live.

Life is just shitty for some of us.

I get that the idea is a suicidal person could always get better, but then lots of people don’t recover. And lots of people then have to take it into their own hands.

Sure there’s a lucky few who achieve a peaceful death.

But then what about everyone who spends their final moments suffering, or those who are permanently damaged from botched suicide attempts?

I think the most peaceful method of death in my country would have to be gas. But then one simple mistake and you’re brain damaged for the rest of your life. Incapable of doing anything to take control of your life anymore.

It’s 2019. WHERE IS MY SUICIDE BOOTH??"
anyone else just want to sleep and never wake up?,im tired.
"I don't want to commit suicide, but it's almost all I think about.","Okay, ""want"" is the wrong word. ""Can't"" fits better.

I *can't* kill myself because of what it would do to my family, how it would tear everything apart. I can't do that to them. 

I need help. I don't want to feel like this anymore. I want to get better, I want to go back to how it used to be. I  just can't do this anymore.

Please please someone help me. I can't keep feeling like this."
What are you realistically supposed to do? I fail to see how suicide is the most harmful option.,"**Option 1:** tell a person you trust, maybe your friend.

**Problem 1:** you place a huge burden on them now to “keep you alive” and they may behave in ways that hurt you instead. They may tell people that you don’t want to know. You don’t want to stay alive no matter what, you want to feel better. And being betrayed doesn’t make anything better.

**Problem 2:** telling someone means you’re not actually serious about killing yourself. “The only truly suicidal people are already dead.”

**Problem 3:** telling someone is manipulative and harmful to *them*. Abusive. If a friend leaving will tip you over the edge, you can’t *tell* them that. It’s not their fault you feel suicidal without them. 

**Problem 4:** you can’t “get help” all by yourself, but you can’t tell anyone else either. And professional help is a long, sometimes expensive process. Like hell I want to go therapist shopping while lying through my teeth to not be locked up against my will. Let alone without the support of a trusted friend. I just want to be better!

**Problem 5:** the reason you’re suicidal in the first place is because life just hurts - the past, the present, the future. It’s not just because of one breakup, or an unpleasant family life, or a toxic relationship, or possible mental health issues, or an existential crisis about your faith. It’s a combination of absolutely everything and no single person can fix that for you, even if you desperately want one to.

**Problem 6:** nothing changes. Except that now you’ve hurt and burdened more people, you’ve damaged relationships, and you feel the same if not worse than before.

**Solution 1:** you don’t tell anyone, in part to not burden or hurt anyone, in part to be taken seriously. I *am* suicidal, and if I need to prove it then so be it. 

**Solution 2:** you commit suicide. People get hurt, but the hurt is less than the cumulative hurt and exhaustion from trying to help when no help can be had. After all, in the end the problem was your existence; not all problems have solutions. Minimize damage by acting now, rather than waiting around for more people to get entangled with you."
Why do others get to decide if we have to live or not? Let me die.,"Why are we forced to stay alive? Why do others go out of their way sooo much to pretend they care by setting up acts like the unusable hotlines and expensive therapists... If I want to die and literally end it all, that should be my choice. I am a burden and I am reminded of that every single day. Just let me go. Why does it have to be about you and your potential grief? I am obviously lacking resources and suffering from a life long illness that will never get better. So why should I continue to suffer? So you dont have to pay for a funeral? That shouldn't even be a thing anyway. 

I also wish overdosing was easier."
Does anyone else admire the people that actually kill their selfs?,"I want to so bad but I’m a huge pussy, but I really do admire people who have the guts too do it like Kurt Cobain or Anthony Bourdane "
Told my partner I'm suicidal,"He took it well. He didn't act like I'm the burden I feel like. He said we'd get me help. 

I expected abandonment. I expected dismissal. Instead I got love and support. It would probably feel good, if I could feel anything right now.

If you are also suffering, I hope you find something similar to help you through the tough times"
"I say ""I wanna fucking die"" to myself out loud at least 10 times a day.",I have an appointment with a psychiatrist on the 12th but I don't know if I can make it that long 
Does anyone else just want to disappear with out the mess?,Just simply vanish. There isn’t a soul who would miss me.
I don't understand why suicide is unacceptable,Why don't I have the right to end my own life? I can't talk about suicide to anyone in real life because the second I bring it up people tell me it's not the way and make me feel like I'm not allowed to even think about it. I never chose to be born and apparently I also can't choose to end my life. Why am I being forced to live when I don't want to? I really don't understand. I really wish suicide was acceptable and people with depression can apply to be euthanized.
Am I the only one living for other people?,Do you ever feel like you're just there because you know you would hurt people if you killed yourself? I just feel like if nobody loved me I could just leave everything but I can't because I know it would change them and they would never be over it. And the thought of being there and only living for other people is awful. I don't wanna live on autopilot for the rest of my life 
I wish euthanasia was an option to suicidal people,"I don't understand why it can't be.
I've been suicidal for so many years but terrified of the consequences of a failed attempt. 
Every week I try my best. I surrend myself with friends, I go to therapy, I exercise, I go hiking, I try to eat well, I put myself out there.


Nothing ever fucking works. I'm so tired of pretending. I'm so tired of trying. I want to explode. I want to tear my life in shreds. All of this shit meaningless, painful and maddening. 

I want out "

I’m a single mother and I want to kill myself.,"I had my daughter at 19. Her father died from cancer when she was 10 months old. I fell into deep depression and wanted to commit suicide. But I convinced myself to keep living until my daughter turned 18. I had nothing at the time, but I was determined to give her the best life until then.

I am now 33. And in those 14 years, I worked my ass off. I was working 2 jobs, while also attending college. I eventually graduated and landed a job that pay well. After a few years I saved up enough money to buy a house. I even put money aside for her college fund. So by the time she turn 18, I would have saved enough money for her to attend a University. Despite all the struggles and barriers I faced, I finally felt content. All my hard work was finally paying off. I started to feel like life was worth living. The thoughts of committing suicide after she turned 18 began to fade.

But now that feeling of self worth is gone and depression has fully taken over again. Everything changed when my daughter turned 14. I found out that she has been sneaking out, having sex, and has been using DXM to get high. My daughter said that she became this way because...of me. Because I was too strict on her with her grades and chores. And that she just wanted to be free. I admit that I do yell at her when she slips up, and that I can be very intense. But I have never lay a hand on her. I grew up in an abusive household, so I told myself I will never hurt her the same way my parents hurt me. I told myself I will raise her the best way that I can. But I failed. I failed as her mother and I was wrong thinking I deserved to live.

I tried putting my daughter in therapy in attempt to help her. She told me she wanted to change. But it was all lies. I still found pills in her room. I even found out that she has a “trap phone”, a secret cellphone she bought from a friend with her birthday money. And she was still sneaking out in the middle of the night to meet up with boys to have sex. I feel like I completely lost her and she would be happier if I was dead. I feel useless. I feel unnecessary. I feel like I’m not good enough to be her mom. My heart hurts so much. I’m just not strong enough to handle this. I just want this all to end."
Suddenly disabled. Husband hates and resents me. I’m alone and scared to death,"A quick explanation of my (37/F) sudden disability: I was a completely healthy, active adult. A few months ago I woke up in the morning, and the muscles all throughout my body had stopped working properly (so weak they shake). I’ve been getting worse by the week and nobody can figure out what’s wrong with me. I’m in constant terrible pain all over and I’ve gotten so frail I’m nearly bed bound. Medication isnt helping the pain or weakness. Can’t care for myself hardly at all now. 

My husband is barely taking care of things that need to be done (laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc). He just sits and games on his computer. If I mention that chores aren’t being done he starts screaming at me until I’m afraid he’s going to hit me.

It happened again today. He didn’t put laundry away, and I can’t dig through the pile to get what I need. He had just been gaming all day instead of doing chores. I’m too weak to tell the whole story but I wound up in a very unsanitary and embarrassing situation because of it. When I brought up the situation with him, he went berserk. I managed to get to my car and leave the house. But I don’t have a coat and it’s 36 degrees out. I have nowhere to go. I’m estranged from my parents due to physical abuse. And my friends have slowly abandoned me over the last few months. I’m completely alone now. I’m in so much pain I want to kill myself. And knowing I’m an unwanted burden who is doomed to a life of neglect and resentment makes me positive I should do it. I have nothing, can’t take care of myself, and I don’t belong anywhere because I’m useless. I don’t know what to do beside figure out a way to end it all. How did this happen to me..

 
EDIT: I managed to drive about 3 miles away and I’m hiding in a parking lot so he can’t find me and hurt me. I’m cold because I have no coat and no idea how to get one since stores are packed due to the holidays and I’m not strong enough to even walk to the door anyway. I’m hungry. Shaking all over from pain and fear. I don’t know what to do. I can’t even think of a way I’d be able to kill myself because I’m too weak. Why is life so cruel"
Anyone else feel like commiting suicide out of spite?,"Because I do. Every single time my family tells me to ""snap out of my depression"" and ""go back to being the person you used to be"" I feel like killing myself in front of them. They don't understand the severity of my situation. They think I can just ""change"". As if I wanted this to be my life. I absolutely hate myself and think of how every second I'm alive is wasted. My mind is a mess and the last time I was genuinely happy was ages ago. I don't know what to do anymore."
Lessons from Four Decades of Depression,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, which is why I am posting here.  (1984 was a very very bad year -- Orwell had it right for me, at least.)  I am not writing in the sense of giving advice.  First I am not a professional, other than by dent of dealing with depression day after day.  Second, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me, realizing several toxic patterns of thought helped me to curtail them.  Each of these eventually leads to ""Why bother"" and the dark conclusions there.  When I start down any of these roads, I do whatever it takes to derail my thinking.  More and that below.

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, one I should have seen coming:  ""Well, I have a great wife, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true, especially if you (like me) are introverted.  Introverted people hate being pressured to be happy.  It depresses us.  Great.  What most of us want is inner peace.  Happiness happens on its own; it cannot be captured by sheer will power.  Let the pressure go.  I suspect we have enough to deal with without it.

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling, put the breaks on the TARDIS.  There is nothing there that your depression can't reach before you open the door.

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, fighting off 5 kidney stones and the knowledge that polycystic kidney disease is turning my innards into oatmeal.  Odd how no one ever tells me to get over it.  You do not ""get over"" chronic conditions.  When people say this about depression, my answer is always, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, don't go rushing to the nearest hot spot, but do something.  Move.  Walk.  Study astronomy.  Take up cooking.  None of this takes a ton of money.  It takes discipline to free yourself from your mind, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie, and it would go against everything I have written above.  There are times when depression still presses in choking tight.  But its grip no longer has the power to kill.  I am not suggesting that joy is around the corner.  I am merely looking out the window.  The first snow of winter is coming down.  It's pretty.  It's okay to live.  One tiny step at a time."
I'm autistic and worthless. (18m),"I was diagnosed with mild autism as a todler. I was bullied in school to no end. I was raised in a strict Christian family that can't take a fucking joke. After my parents got divorced I came to the realisation that marriage and true love is just a lie. I have suffered from ADHD, depression, anxiety, and a low self-esteem. I'm ugly as hell and will always be alone. I can't take the pain anymore! The only reason I'm still here is because my family will be heart broken without me. How can I stop the pain?"
i think im trying to ruin my life so its easier to suicide,"even when everything is going fine, i'm actively trying to make things worse. i don't do my course work, i try to ruin relationships, i eat garbage or not at all, and barely sleep.

i'm terrified i'm getting stupider, i'm losing brain cells. i used to be smarter i know it.

i need to kill myself, i can't imagine feeling good or having an easy time getting out of bed

i live in a garbage heap. i havent done laundry in weeks. i lie to my psychiatrist/psychologist every time.

i need to kill myself, but i'm too happy. my depression is fake, i'm just lazy. i have too many friends, there are things i look forward to. but nothing important. i dont care about my future and i need to die."
I wish i could go to sleep to never wake up again.,"I'm only 20 years old and I'm already pretty tired. It's like everyday i go through the same shit and a painful feeling of loneliness and depression hits me too. I have heavy social anxiety and I'm shy af, also no friends, no gf, and my future seems even darker. I cry myself to sleep every night and i reached the point where i wish i could go to sleep and die, because i know i don't have the balls to actually kill myself."
Suicide prevention at the Golden Gate Bridge actually worked,"I’ve been traveling in San Francisco for the last week. Since I started planning this trip, my intent had been to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge at some point during my stay. I was not planning on returning to my home country. 

I went to the bridge on the second day to scout it out. High barriers and nets prevent jumping off the ends of the bridge with land underneath, but a 4-foot guardrail is the only thing that prevents jumping off the middle of the bridge. I could have done it right then but it was the middle of the day and I was with a friend; really didn’t want to scar anybody. 

So instead, I went back last night around 8pm. I hung around near the welcome center preparing myself for a few minutes, then approached the pedestrian walkway. What I hadn’t predicted was the walkway being closed to pedestrian access at 6:30pm! I was way too afraid of getting caught by the cameras or patrol guards while sneaking over the barrier, so I headed back home and make a plan to return. 

My flight back home was at 6:30am, so I planned to leave my host’s house around 4:30am pretending to go to the airport, but actually going back to the bridge which opened at 5am for pedestrians. I set my alarm-clock for 4am and went to sleep. 

I woke up needing to pee around 2am, and the
full weight of what I was planning to do suddenly hit me. I started having major doubts about the plan working, worried about somehow surviving, chickening out while on the bridge but then missing my flight and getting stuck here, or the patrol people catching me and certifying me under a 5150. That would mean missing my flight, a huuuge medical bill since I don’t have US insurance, and a massive freak out from my family. 

So, after considering all of those factors, I cancelled the taxi I had booked for the GGB and rebooked a new one for the airport. I’m here now waiting to get on the plane. 

Moral of the story: I never thought things like barriers or nets or patrols would deter people, but I guess it worked on me. This would have been my seventh and probably final attempt, the other 6 including overdoses that ended in multi-day comas, slashing my wrists, and starving myself. I’m sure I’ll try again in the near future but for now I’m safe, so thanks, GGB, for that. I guess.  "
I told my husband.,"I told my husband I was suicidal as expected he cried and got upset. He made me promise not to leave him. I promised him. I feel good finally asking for help, now that's it's the new year and I have health insurance I can finally get the medicine I need. Plus I had a job interview this morning that was pretty promising. Who knows maybe 2017 is the year everything turns around for me. I have a good feeling about this year. 

Sorry if this isn't the right spot for it. I just felt like I needed to share with someone. Since it was the topic of suicide I figured this was the place to post it.

Hang in there everybody.

Edit:words"
A friendly reminder about PMs,"Hello all!

Lately we’ve been noticing a serious increase in the number of people inviting PMs, posting identifying information (this includes usernames on other social media sites) and generally not following the [rule regarding keeping conversations *public* unless the OP asks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/xgrba/from_the_suicidewatch_mod_team_if_youre_here_to/)

***


So, why are we so adamant about enforcing these rules? What’s the big deal about moving conversations to PM anyway? Well, there are risks on both sides. 

**For the poster/person in distress** – there is no one to point out if you are being given bad or dangerous advice. Having multiple people comment, or even just able to read the conversation can make a big difference. When the conversation stays on the subreddit, we’re able to step in if needed. People with questionable motives are more likely to want to move to PM, since then no one can point out their inappropriate behavior or contradict them. 

**For the people commenting** – When you move to PM there can be an expectation that you will make everything better. That is an *enormous* pressure to put on a single person. Even hotline responders have people with them helping to back them up and keep them level headed. Keeping things out in the open means sharing the responsibility and letting others step in as needed. 

**For everyone** - Posting information regarding other social media accounts (your skype username, telephone number, etc) is ***not allowed*** by our subreddit or by Reddit itself. We will remove all posts that do this. 

‘But skyqween, these risks are okay with me. **Why else would I bother keeping my discussion out in the open?**’ Great question! Having your conversation visible to others isn’t just about risk management (though that is the main reason). The [90/10/1](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/participation-inequality/) rule of the internet says that for every person posting in distress, there are roughly nine more lurking and reading the supportive comments because they aren’t comfortable making a post themselves. So, when you keep your conversation visible to others you’re also *helping others to feel less alone and misunderstood.*

##This is the bottom line:

If you are a poster in distress, we very much hope that you will choose to have a conversation out in the open. However, we recognize that some are not comfortable with this. If you’re not comfortable posting publicly there are alternatives to simply making a post asking for PMs. You are always welcome to message the mods and talk to us privately. Another avenue you might want to explore is choosing someone who has a good track record in the community that you feel comfortable talking to and messaging *them* directly. However, at the end of the day if you are a poster and feel that you must post asking for a private conversation we understand. Please just be aware of the risks going forward. 

##If you are a commenter and want to ask people to pm you despite all this – don’t. We will remove the posts when they are brought to our attention and when we find them.

"I have nobody left to care. My boyfriend never loved me, my friends never liked me. I'm a fat worthless cow.",I don't have any desire left in me to keep going in life. I spent 1 year with this man and he tore my heart apart. He won. She won. I can't do it anymore. I really just want to die so bad. I've already attempted suicide once. Maybe this time I won't chicken out.
anyone else feel like the concept of life is such a cruel thing,"we are literally born for no reason, no one asked to be here and we’re all going to eventually die anyways. yet we have to study, work and make a living for the bare minimum. literally everything is meaningless. how the fuck did everything even start? why is life so unusual and complex. i feel like an alien."
Suicide survivor doesn't want treatment,"Hello, so my brother is 19 and he jumped from 5 storie building and is injured very badly, he is in the hospital for about 2 months now and he is still in bad shape, he can barely speak, barely move and now he want's to go home, and it would be a so hard for my divorced not rich parrents, why doesn't he want treatment? What to do?"
My reason for living is gone,"My boyfriend killed himself while we were on vacation at his family’s lake house. He left us to find him with a belt around his neck. We tried CPR, I held his head while the medics worked on him. I can’t get it out of my head. I can’t be without him. I don’t know how to be by myself. I haven’t gone more than 2 days without seeing him in a year, and it’s been 3 since it happened. My whole family is worried about me and I don’t want to be selfish but I can’t see myself here in this planet without him. I don’t know what I believe in, I don’t know if he’s reincarnated or in the spirit world or in heaven but I need to know. I can’t do it right now. I have a wait a while. I can’t do that to our families. It’s my fault for not knowing he’d do this, his family didn’t even know he was depressed but I knew. And I never thought anything like this would happen. I need him back. I can’t go on anymore. There’s so much pain in my body. Every night when I lay down I feel the pressure around my neck and I just want it to end. I’m too scared to hang myself like that. I just want to slip away peacefully. I just want as many pills as I can take and go somewhere where my family won’t find me before the police. I’ll leave a note, unlike him. I’ll give people answers. He took all of my answers away from me. The only answer I have from him is to go with him. I don’t know why he’d do this to us. I feel him slipping away. He’s my soulmate. I don’t know what to do. I’m waiting for him to tell me if I should do it, but he’s not answering me. I don’t want to be here without him. I just can’t do it. I’m not strong enough without him. "
Does suicide feel like the only logical option to anyone else?,"Life is really meaningless, it just feels like there's no point on staying alive, im probably gonna end it when I can '"
My friend who committed suicide is getting no life recognition and it is pissing me off,"I am off and on suicidal and for the first time in my life, someone I know killed himself. He was a high school friend of my boyfriend's, we didn't see each other too often but when we did we always had a blast. He was the kind of guy who would literally do anything for you. I wasn't the closest to him but if I needed him he would've driven the 4+ hours away he lived from me to come help. 

He had the biggest heart.

Now he is dead at 27. Nobody is talking about it on his facebook (he only had 70~ facebook friends, but that's the kind of guy he was). 

His closest friends were my boyfriend and two of my boyfriends other friends. His funeral is on Sunday on the 31st but he doesn't get a proper funeral. There is no burial. I am pretty sure the extent of his death being honoured will be it mentioned on mass on the 31st, but not with a single brochure. 

HE WAS AN AMAZING PERSON. Literally one of the kindest hearts, and he is barely getting acknowledged and it is driving me nuts. I know that those who loved him and were close to him are acknowledging him in their hearts everyday but it is just pissing me off that nobody is talking about him.

He was thrown too much shit in life and was not given the chance to flourish. 

I just wanted to let the world know that they lost someone really amazing this month."
"My last act will be giving my abusive family and ex-fiancee a body to wake up to on Christmas day. I am a kind, sensitive person but have no cares left to give.","I just want to get this out there, not as a cry for help but as a last attempt at some human communication before I die tonight. Why should we be forced to live in a world so fucking cruel? My self worth was decimated in my childhood to the point where I can't cope with the challenges you have to face to be happy. Job interviews, dating.. simply sitting and planning out a path for my life are too anxiety inducing to bare at this point and my whole world has completely collapsed.

When I was eight my dad died from cancer and I was raised by a single mother. From the outside she looks like this strong woman who raised two kids through turbulent times but in cold hard reality she was about as terrible a parent as you can get. She constantly threatened to 'run away' and leave us when we were naughty, routinely told me I was adopted, moved us in with various boyfriends and blamed me personally for the failure of the relationships (""my life would be so much better if you were never born""). When I was 11 she made me beg one of her boyfriends to take her back when he broke up with her because he didn't like the fact she had children. Another one of her boyfriends was 'permitted' to physically abuse me in pretty extreme ways. I would get hit with planks of wood for not unloading the dishwasher and put in arm bars for talking back. I have never heard her admit to being wrong about anything, never heard her apologise and really can see no way to get along with her when she is so extremely different to me. She is racist, has no interest in education or anything more intelligent than reality television and lives off of a tiny monthly life insurance/government pension paid out to widows.

I was painfully shy as a teenager and threw myself into my studies as a means to escape. The one thing I still had going for me was my ability to concentrate because depression hadn't kicked in yet. I left school with straight A grades and went off to study at one of the best universities in my country, it is placed alongside Ivy League universities in world rankings. I wanted to study medicine and become a cancer specialist but I didn't have the self-esteem to apply and opted for human biology instead. Just before I left for college I went to a party in my hometown and met a girl who was about to go and study medicine at a college around 100 miles from mine. It was a perfect night when everyone from school was there saying goodbye to each other and I must have looked a lot more popular than I was with everyone coming to say goodbye to me. She approached *me* and got talking about my plans for college, our chemistry was insane and then she started kissing me. It was unbelievable, she was incredibly beautiful and smart and only had eyes for me. 

I have serious commitment issues and it took about 6 months for me to tell her I loved her, but we talked every day about how much we missed each other and would visit each other's colleges on alternating weekends. I just couldn't get her out of my mind. That Christmas she introduced me to her family and I saw what a real family is for the first time. Loving, interesting conversation, day trips, vacations. The next year was like a dream. She took me to Europe and we visited fifteen countries by train, sleeping in shared hostels and having sex in public bathrooms. The second year was tougher, depression and anxiety began to consume my life but she was loving as ever. I was on a lot of medication and gradually pushed every other person out of my life but she would come to my apartment and put out the bins, buy me food for the week and help me study. I trusted only her. By the time exams came around I was in such a terrible state I turned up to precisely one of them and was told to take a year out by the university's welfare officer. I did that and tried to get better. I tried to run and exercise, see a few friends here and there but the illness was too tough to properly overcome. I was in my twenties and had never had a job, I felt pathetic in every way and strongly considered suicide, but my love for this girl kept me alive.

I returned to college and after a year of anxiety hell managed to complete my studies. The only reason I graduated was that I chose every class that didn't have a final exam, as I knew one exam would be too much pressure. Instead I had endless coursework to complete for random classes about globalisation or the history of science leaving me with a degree totally irrelevant to any industry. 

I was so lost and embarrassed in life, I had no idea how to get a job and didn't want to talk to any friends. I deleted almost everyone from social media because I couldn't stand to see their perfect lives. Once again my girlfriend came to my rescue and took me on a road trip across the US. Again, it was incredible. I asked her why the hell she was with me. She told me I was tall, handsome, intelligent and she knew that just as soon as she graduated and we moved in together I would finally be able to build the confidence I needed to succeed. She truly believed in me after all that time. I asked her to marry me. She said yes, but she wanted a perfect wedding so just as soon as I had a group of friends to attend and we were earning some money we would do it. She graduated in August and we moved in together in September. She started working at a nearby hospital and I went and interviewed for a job in retail to pay my half of the rent. I planned on volunteering, making friends and working on getting a better job this year. From September 1st to November 1st this year I no longer had depression. I was getting up every single day, going to work, coming home and making her dinner. I was fixing up a bike to travel around the city and going out for dinner once a week with my soulmate. Then she left me. She knew everything I'd been through and promised me for years that we'd be happy once we got our own place. I travelled every weekend for 5 hours each way on an old bus to keep her company, make her dinner and take her on dates. 

She has no interest on working on things and says she hasn't loved me for two years, but having someone to help her through the end of med school was 'comfortable'. These last two months have been insufferable. We still sleep in the same bed. All I wanted to do was pull my life together and show her that I'm capable of stepping up and providing us with a great life but some nights I can't help but beg. She has only become more cold and spiteful with each day. She says I'm not a real man, I'm not funny, I'm terrible in bed, she is going to bring other men home and have sex in our apartment. I guess our sex life fell into a rut but she always finished before me and I made her laugh all the time. She doesn't tidy anything in the apartment and I have to run around like an abused housewife washing dishes and cleaning up after her but I can't afford to live anywhere else and I can't go back to my mum's house. It's like a monster has replaced my beautiful angel. She says she is so happy without me and now she's gone to her parents for 10 days. They are *my* family too at this point but I'm not allowed near the house. Her dad is my closest friend other than her and is in denial that she has done this, saying she is just stressed with her new job. I haven't spoken to her for 3 days but tried phoning this afternoon with no answer. Now I have to go and spend Christmas with a family I thought I'd escaped and have barely spoken to for years. Fuck that. I simply will not do this anymore. I cannot spend another day in this horrible fucking world."
Fantasizing about Suicide because it helps me cope.,"I fantasize about suicide often. I do it because when I'm fantasizing about how I'm going to take my own life, I dont think about all the other negatives in my life. It's become like a form of meditation for me. It makes me feel calm. Like I finally have control over something.
I've come very close to doing it befor, but held back because I still have some people that love me and responsibilities to those people. But it has gotten more and more tempting as time goes by. The fantasy becomes a plan. And eventually, plans become reality."
My cat may save my life,I was dead set on dying tomorrow but I had a crying fit and my cat just came over and sat near me and I broke down and just sat there staring and I told him all my problems
Life has completely destroyed me.,"I am a 25 year old woman now and i am completely broken. I will end my life tonight. My mom died when i was 9 and when my dad took ""care"" of me i was raped for 3 whole years. Almost every single day i was abused. This left me as a severe depressed shy girl in highschool and i was bullied for being like that. I told my only best ""friend"" what happened to me and suddenly the whole school found out. I attacked her for it, injured her badly and ended up in a teen jail (we have that in germany, not sure if that exists elsewhere). After a few months there the guards started to sexually abuse me as well. I left my body at this point and wasn't really there anymore mentally. 

After all this, life finally looked good for me, i started a job and had my own apartment and i thought it gets better. But apparently one of my old highschool classmates then black mailed me, threatening to tell my boss about my past. I begged him not to do it, and he asked me for sex or he will leak the information. I had to oblige and took his abuse to keep my job. Police never believed me because i had no evidence. He blackmailed me in person, not digitally. I couldn't prove it. After 1 year of being his sextoy, he still leaked the info.

I got fired today and am now homeless. I am literally using my last phone battery to type this down. I have nowhere to go now. The women's help organization disapproved of me as well because i was in jail once.


I completely lost all hope there is nothing that will change my mind anymore. I reached the end and it will end now. Goodbye.




Edit: Thanks so much everyone. Sorry i can't respond to each of you. I am now being taken care of in a mental institution. All of you together did change my mind in the end..."
The sad thing about suicide is that people make it about themselves and then life goes on.,"People talk about how hurt they are or how confused...that they never saw it coming...others encourage them by saying that no one could have stopped it or that no one would've known that the suicidal person was in pain during their time on earth. People spend so much time making their suicide about them that they forget that they could have done something about it..that they could have reached out to the person before it was too late. 

It makes me sick. People post on social media about how heart broken they are, add their 'thoughts and prayers are with their family' bull crap, a few hashtags and boom. They're absolved of all guilt and pain and go on with their lives. I hate society. I hate the way people make tragedy about themselves and then go on with their life. I refuse to live in a world where a person could feel so helpless, so lonely, so depressed, so troubled, that they take their life...only to be left behind by people that don't think of a solution to prevent suicide, but rather about how hurt they are and how much it has affected them. What about the pain that you may have contributed to this persons life? Everyone acts as if it isn't a preventable thing when it is. Oh, well.

In other words. I'm done living in a world overflowing with so much ego. I'd rather be dead. Goodbye cruel world."
Anyone else ever just lose the desire to eat entirely?,"Haven't eaten all day and I'm still not hungry in the slightest, just tired, tired in my soul."
When you can't kill yourself soo you live as a soulless person,"I'm the youngest in the family. 17. My whole  childhood  has been devastating. Child abuse and mental manipulation 

When i was 4 i was sexualy assaulted by a babysitter  and never talked about it. 

When i cried as a child they'd tell me to man up or that men don't cry. and from there i never got a tear out. no matter how much of a mental wreck i was. i always absorbed the damage and kept it inside.  The weight  is heavy on my chest. 

I always was enslaved by my manipulative brother. ont day when he stole something  that i loved i chocked the shit out of him. they forced me to apologize.  And another time where he false accused me of something. i was mad i tried to stab the shit out of him. i got sent to my room. i cried and when my dad tried talking to me  he said that we don't  need your problems too
I've gone out and thought of suicide

Then i stopped myself  because  the only person i cared about (my mother) would be sad. I may be suicidal but I'm  a man of dedication  and a strong mentality and
  i promised that no harm should be donne to her

Now I'm  living like this. Can't feel anything. Can't trust anyone. or open to any guy."
"Was drunk last night and wrote notes to my friends and family, woke up to find this one and cried.","Dear Me,
I know how hurt you are, I know how sad you are. But one day, one damn day, you’re gonna look back and think, wow, times sucked back then, but I got through them. I’m happy with my family of four and I’m happy with my beautiful wife. The Godfather of my children is my best friend and they always ask to see him and we always do. We wake up every Sunday morning to eat pancakes and head to Church. I work at a job that helps take care of my children and wife, plus I make enough to hand over some money to my mom and dad. I’m happy with my life and don’t wish any bad upon myself or wish to die anymore.

At least, I wish that’s how my life could’ve been.

I feel like some fucked up NPC in a game where everyone else seems to be main characters. Like I've been programmed to suffer perpetually and eventually kill myself.,"alt account because people I know, know my main account username.

hello reddit.
I would really like to die, because it seems like the optimist in me is completely dead. And that's a good thing, because I can't count the number of times I've planned on killing myself, only to have a tiny voice in my head go ""Just wait a little bit longer. You'll be happy someday"". I would like to kill myself, because yes, I'm a fucking pussy, and living my life despite it making any sense to do so, has gotten exhausting. I try sleeping when it feels like my head's about to blow up from the emotional stress. Let's be honest, it's only a short term solution to a long term problem. Before I ask you guys what I want to ask, let me try talking a little bit maybe. There's a tiny fucking bit of the optimist who needs to shut the fuck up.

I've been working on my dreams of making comic book stories for a little over a year now, while also working a full time job. It's been rough, and what sucks is just the country I live in, which I'm convinced has to be the worst fucking country ever. It's India. Everyone here is a giant piece of shit. Everything is conservative and rooted in tradition, and it's been hard to try to exist. Doesn't help that your country has a shit reputation online either, cuz no one wants to fucking be friends with you. What makes me empty inside, is the daily dose of demotivation I get from coworkers from my full time job (I don't have friends to depend on). It's been hell trying to manufacture my own happiness. I don't think I can properly articulate how doomed things feel sometimes

The worst days are when you're hurting and there's no one to talk to (which happens every-time I'm suicidal). When you believe the shit they tell you. I used to be a cutter, but worked on myself for a long time to stop that. It feels a lot harder to handle the pain, honestly. These last few days, I've started to gain the confidence to try to off myself.

So what I ask is this. Please advise some solid ways I can kill myself. I've been thinking about either bleeding out slowly (i would prefer going out this way) or carbon monoxide poisoning, but I have no idea how to properly pull it off.


Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sorry if I sound angry, or like a shit person or something."
self isolation made me realize how pathetic and lonely i am,"everyone always jokes about being alone or staying home all day and doing nothing, but now that we are actually all in isolation suddenly everyone’s a happy extrovert that misses their friends and school and work and going out etc.. of course i knew this all along, people just say things to be relatable, but it doesn’t help me feel anymore normal about the fact that i am an actual introvert who stays home all day and has no friends or no hobbies or nothing to do at all, and those weren’t ‘jokes’ they were my life. and being in quarantine is no different for me. it’s pathetic really."
I've lost her. It's final. She's gone and I'm not ready.,"I was falling asleep on the phone with my girlfriend. I've been having a shut day and my depersonalization kicked in earlier. She had already gone to sleep and I was slowly drifting off until I got a call. The name was ""Papa"". I immediately woke up. My heart fucking burst and before I even accepted the call I started bawling. I say hello and I hear his voice ""Is your mom home? Can you bring her the phone I couldn't get ahold of her."" I rush down the stairs unable to see from the tears and wake mom up and hand her the phone saying it's papa. She wakes up instantly and says ""God please no"" I start crying even harder. The first words my grandpa says is ""Mom's going right now"" at that I collapsed into the fetal position and lost it. 

I can't take this. This is more painful than anything I've experienced. The cutting, the pain I felt before attempting suicide in the past, the abuse. Nothing hurts more than losing 1 of the only two people who made me feel like I mattered. 

I'll miss you so godamn much grandma you were the only family I had. I just can't let myself be alone. I can't stop crying. This took me over 30 minutes to write."
"My husband died, I'm left with 6 kids 3 of which are my neice and nephews who are survivors of sexual assault. I don't want to do this anymore.","This is going to be an extremely long post,and some of this information may seem irrelevant but it all ties together why I just don't want to carry on in this world anymore, so if you make it to the end I'm grateful you read my story. I grew up in a very emotionally abusive household with a schizophrenic mother and a narcissistic father, but I overcame the years of abusive relationships with abusive men and finally found true love in 2007 

  As the title states my husband of ten years passed away from cancer in August, just 3 days after our ten year Anniversary. He fought cancer for a good 2 years but everything happened so quickly. I was his caregiver up until hospice got involved the last 3 weeks of his life. Even at that point I did 90 percent of the work. I'm absolutely traumatized by seeing him waste away, I won't go into too many details because it makes me physically ill to remember him that way, but his tumors were wrapped around his corroded artery and he had a trach tube and a feeding tube. He couldn't speak because the tumors were everywhere in his mouth, so he had to use that stupid text to speech. 

 At this point we had our 3 children ages 2, 9, and 7.
We also had custody of a neice aged 13 and a nephew aged 15. We had them for about 7 years, due to my neice telling me during a visit that her babysitters were sexually assaulting her. I did contact social services in the county they were living in and the 3 other children were interviewed but lied and said there was no abuse. They had already been removed from the home and in foster  care for two years, but my brother and his wife were given back custody. They were scared and threatened every day, and their mother was also physically abusing them and their father too.  In hindsight I should've done more to pursue this family of molesters. When I told social services they said now that my neice was in another county it wasn't worth reporting it and because it would be traumatic to my neice to be interviewed. I have a tremendous amount of guilt for not telling them to fuck off and calling the cops. As the saying goes; hindsight is 20/20. Several months later my brother left his emotionally and physically abusive wife (mind you I was still unaware and very much in denial about his part in this). They all came and stayed with us, my brother and his 3 other children. I found out months later after giving my brother a free place to live he was speaking and visiting his abusive wife the entire time. Once asked to leave he ended up taking his younger two boys and leaving his oldest son with us. I'm kind of unsure why that was the case, but that's what happened. 

My neice went through rough times, lots of bed wetting and attention seeking behavior. She was also extremely mean to my daughter who would've been 3 at the time. I feel like she learned to start problems with people and play victim because that's what her mom did. So many unhealthy behaviors that rubbed off on my daughter. I should have gotten her into therapy right away, but I guess I kind of thought she had talked to me about it and kind of moved on. 

My nephew has always been pretty well behaved, and had some anger twords me for not swooping in earlier to save him. He has always completely shut down when it comes to any sort of emotions. He's a very good kid in general but definitely angry.  Again we had to try and help them unlearn this learned behavior. The swearing and the threats of killing people. 

Fast forward to 2017 when my husband was diagnosed with his cancer. Again, I just can't go into too many details because it's still too painful. It was a solid two years without any intimacy and again me being his caregiver not his wife. It was okay though, all of it because I had something people only dream about. True, unconditional fucking love. I would do it a million times over if I had too. Again though, I have so much guilt for not spending more time with him, but there were 5 kids that needed to be cared for. Slowly all the kids drifted farther and farther away from dad, because I think it was too scary for them to see. The only one who didn't was the youngest, she didn't see cancer guy, she just saw dad. I think she kind of got him through the really, really tough times.  

After my husband passed away, I was not invited to partake in the writing of his eulogy by his family, because according to his mother, I was in no state to contribute, was I? I was really shoved aside by his parents and aunts, but more specifically his mother. To this day she doesn't call or try to see her grandkids, the only remnants of her son. It breaks my fucking heart to see this, I'd be fine never seeing her again, but wtf why don't you see the kids? My husband was a man of very strong faith, and very selfless so he knew he was going to a better place and he felt terrible that he was going to have to leave us. All the children also go to a private school, which now I'm very grateful for. At the visitation and the funeral the kids went right up to him and touched him and said ""daddy's not even in there anymore, he's in heaven."" As someone who struggles with faith, I'm okay with this. The little kids need that faith right now. 

Fast forward about 5 months and my nephew Sean comes for a sleepover, it's Christmas break, so he keeps asking every night if he can sleep over. Alright dude, that's cool, but what's up? Why don't you want to go home? Turns out both parents are physically abusing him, and the emotional abuse every day all day is enough to break the strongest of people. Alright, I'm calling your dad, I will do whatever it takes to keep this kid safe. Throughout all this my brother who's been tn the methadone program for several years finds his wife has been shooting meth for 6 months but hadn't noticed? Things were okay, Sean is openly gay which is fine with me but he also has an extremely foul mouth which I've had to reign in constantly.  Now there's this strange shift in my nieces behavior, and by now she's been in therapy for several months because she said she was suicidal. But it's a really bad shift in her. She's even more spiteful and bitchy and mean to the little kids. And her and Sean are trying to share a room, and I say absolutely not. I sense a very unhealthy connection between those two. A strange co dependency I've never before seen. 

Over this time my neice Kailey decides to come out to me as gay. Okay, that's fine. But are you gay or are you wanting to fit in or get attention. I apologize if that statement offends anyone but I know her and this is the polar opposite of her normal boy crazy behavior. My oldest nephew has been lost in all of this drama between Kailey and Sean. They fight eachother, Kailey beats up all the little kids and is frankly out of control with her behavior. I think Sean coming here has triggered something in her. Something very unhealthy. I believe that not only were her and Sean made to perform sexual acts on these male and female babysitters but also on eachother. I don't know what to do. They must be carrying around a huge weight of shame even though it isn't their fault. My goal is to get Sean into therapy so we can figure some of this out. 

I feel like I've failed my children. Everyone says they need structure, but wtf does that look like when there's six of them and one of me. I have realized every single one of them take advantage of and are very rude to me. I'm tired, tired of missing my husband, tired of going through the motions but just wanting to not be here anymore. I resent mostly my neice for coming here and really affecting my children's behavior in a negative way. I resent my husband for leaving me all alone. I resent my own children because I have to stay on this fucking earth because they need me. I often fantasize how I would die. I wouldn't want them to find me because it would be awful for them. I think about hanging and the second before I kick that stool out I text my friend telling her to get the kids from school and that I'm ending it all. My oldest nephew completely shuts down and won't say a word. His anger is real, one day he pushed me so hard I fell and hit my head very hard. His guilt and shame was immediately apparent. But the realization was holy shit, this kid could beat the shit out of me. I'm working on getting everyone else in therapy (my two nephews and my daughter). My son has been going since before his dad died because he has childhood anxiety and depression and hdhd. 

I'm not a nice mother, I yell and I swear and I ask them wtf is wrong with them for them to act this way. I do feel like as much as they love me, they would be better off without me. They always worry about me, and I would like them to not bear that burden. Every morning I wake up with more and more anxiety, I take .5 mg kolonopin to help  slow down my mind. Sometimes I think I'm just not meant for this world, there's just too much pain and the monotony of every day doesn't help. I'm absolutely lost. Every day the urge to die is stronger. I'm not even afraid anymore. The last few weeks I have truly realized how terrible things are. How awful the kids treat eachother and treat me, how they don't even hear my yelling anymore. How I'm cleaning up after everyone, everyday because nobody helps me. It's like, at first the kids were what got me through and kept me going, but now I feel like anger and sadness is just hurting them. I feel ready to die, but for now I'm going to leave it  in the cruel hands of fate. I'm aware I need help, but there's no time for it. I'm too busy trying to keep these kids from killing eachother and trying to not kill myself. Idk if this was the right place to share my story, but I figured because my want to die is so strong maybe this would be the place. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."

I hung myself 17 years ago,"I was 20 years old. I wrapped a heavy insulated wire around a tree branch, stood on an old metal folding chair and wrapped the stiff wire around my neck a bunch of times, I said to myself ""well, this is it"" and stepped off the chair. I was instantly unconscious. I woke up in a hospital thinking it was the next day but two days had passed and I was tied to the bed with sores around my ankles where I was restrained. They told me my body was wrenching and writhing violently and the paramedics thought I was on pcp. One of my roommates found me hanging and had saved my life. Thanks, I guess. I was sent to a mental hospital with a very sore throat. Turns out I don't like being locked up. I told them what they needed to hear and they let me out in 72 hours. I've tried to appreciate this second chance for 17 years. I'm not lonely. I'm my happiest and most at peace when no other person can see or hear me. There is no hope, nothing helps. I could see the future back then as I can now and I want/ed no part of it. I've tried. I've tried so fucking hard. I've had my last birthday. "
Planning a Suicide calms me.,"Every time I get stressed and have an anxiety epsiode, my mind subconsciously plans a method to kill myself. 
And before I know it, 30 mins will be passed and I will be calm as a clam. I haven't gathered courage to attempt again but I sure have thought of every possible way and calculated the risks, amount of time it takes, availablity of such materials assisting suicide, effective time to attempt, etc etc. 

Everyday I drown a little more into the depth, I can't stop drowning, everytime I think this is little better, I drown 100 times more, it's like I can't even be at peace for 2 days then it hits me again. I am afraid of being 'happy' because I know the good deal of it is waiting for me. 
I can't talk to my friends, even though I made some through online, I can't openly talk to them or cry to them because i don't want them to drown with me in my depression. 

Hopefully I can somehow gain courage to atleast attempt a little one, may not be deadly but gotta start somewhere again. That's all I can be 'hopeful' for. 

Thank you for reading."

A moment of your time please ❤️,"Hello, Reddit

My name is Rob, and I have a life changing favor to ask. 

I have debated on making this post numerous times. However I always made an excuse to back out. I’m not sure if this is allowed here, and if it isn’t, I’m truly sorry, but this seems to be the place where I can speak directly with the kinds of people that this message is aimed at. 

This will be an extremely personal look into mental health, and the side effects of said illnesses, but this is the last shot I could come up with. Ok... with all that being said.... 

I have been medically diagnosed with multiple illnesses. Ranging from multiple personalities, to extreme anxiety, and depression. I had a physically, sexually, and mentally abused upbringing. Videogames have always been an escape for me. They used to help me out tremendously with my social disorders... I used to talk to strangers all around the world. I played Socom on PS2, Rainbow Six 3 on PC, and a ton of Xbox Live on the original Xbox.. mostly Pandora Tomorrow’s multiplayer. 

However... as years went on. I started to distance myself from any and all social happenings. Even if I had friends online I would always “go offline” to hide. On Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PS4 I always just put myself into a private party so I can’t hear anyone. 

After this went on for almost a decade... I finally decided it was time to end my life. I had done nothing for society, and I always ran from people even if they tried to help. However, this attempt would prove unsuccessful, as the belt around my neck broke before I had fully succumbed. 

I don’t have hardly any family left, or a single friend. I understand it’s my fault entirely. However... today, I’m wanting to make a positive change in my life for once. 

As someone who doesn’t get out and is scared to talk to people.. you can imagine how difficult it is to make friends. 

However, I started thinking, “the internet has millions of people... maybe this message would reach a person and we would start a meaningful friendship”.  That was my thought process behind this whole post anyway. 

Why post it here, you may ask? 

Well.... Videogames are *literally* the only thing I know. I have followed this industry my whole life. It’s the only thing I know how to talk about. So I figured... if I was to make a friend, what better place to look then on the internet ^.^

In closing: if there is a kind soul out there that would be willing to be patient and understanding with me and start slow (IE: text messaging, over voice at first) it would mean the absolute world to me. 

Thank you all so much for reading. 

❤️ you all 

-Rob"
Suicide hotlines are completely useless,"I’m going through a rough time and called a suicide hotline. It was a totally pointless conversation. They just wanted to direct me to other resources that I already knew existed. I want to talk to someone, not be told to go to the emergency room or to get a psychiatrist. It’s like the people on the line assume you’ve never dealt with mental health issues or depression and completely lack common sense. I don’t need to go to a hospital or be committed, I just need someone to listen to me."
I think about dying whenever I’m stressed,"I haven’t been actively suicidal for a little over a year. Yet, whenever things get difficult, my mind always turns to suicide. Every time. I feel pathetic and really weak for feeling suicidal from normal life stresses...sometimes it makes me feel like I’m not cut out for life...

I don’t necessarily want to die, because I want to fulfill my dreams (which are really basic...traveling more, making a lifelong friend group, finding love, etc etc) but things just get so difficult and I wonder if my dreams are worth all this suffering."
I end every day thinking about ending my life.,"It doesn't matter what I do. I go out for walks, I interact with my family, I play with my pet, I cook healthy meals. And I still go to bed crying. I just don't want to be here anymore."
boyfriend of 6 years killed himself 2 months ago. I’m just done.,"title pretty much sums it up. I’ve been depressed since I was a child, have wanted to kill myself for the past decade. I’ve always felt like something was just “missing” in my brain. I’ve been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and fucked up pretty much every friendship I’ve ever had. I’ve gone to therapy, been on meds, was institutionalized a couple times. Nothing helps.

It’s not that I don’t love life, because I think it’s wonderful and grand. I’ve traveled a lot, and done so much. I genuinely love myself and I love painting and hiking and film and so much in life.. But I just am so tired. I’ve wanted to die for so long. And then two months ago, the love of my life killed himself. We were supposed to get married. He was the only person that I ever had any sort of connection with. He was so unbelievably wonderful and kind and I miss and love him so much. The past two months have been truly, truly horrible. I never thought I could feel so much pain. I’ve had a countless amount of horrible, sad nights due to my mental illness but none even compare. I bought heroin to kill myself. I’ve never done it, so I have no tolerance so mixing that and a few beers will surely do the job. It’s also how my boyfriend died (not an addict, but bought it to kill himself).

I’m driving across the country tomorrow. My family thinks I’m starting a new job (which I do have one lined up that I accepted as a “just in case”), but I’m really just going to travel for a couple more days, see some art museums, go on a hike, and then finally do it. Part of me is scared, but I can’t go on like this anymore. Each day has somehow gotten worse since my boyfriend died, and it’s absolutely unbearable.  I tried to kill myself a month ago and just ended up in a mental hospital that only made things worse. I’m sad about thinking about dying, but only because I’m sad that it can’t end up any other way. Both of my parents have life long mental illnesses that don’t go away, and I have no desire to end up like that. Anyway, I just wanted to tell someone. I’m a really open person, and it’s hard to not talk about this with anyone. Everyone around me knows I’m suicidal (obviously, since I was just in the hospital), but no one knows I have another plan. 

Sorry this was so long. thanks for reading "
I tried to kill myself last night and failed.,"As of yesterday I was on day 8 off all opiate medication. For years I had drug abuse issues, but went on a methadone than suboxone program. I recently came off it and was struggling with withdrawals. Last night I went and bought 20 8mg dilaudid pills crushed them up put them into a needle and shot it into my arm. I had about 10 seconds where I thought should I call 911 do I really want this, and than everything faded. I woke up 10 hours later with 30 missed calls from my parents , ex girlfriend and my only friend. All who had contacted each other knowing something was wrong, as I wasn’t answering my phone and was going thru withdrawals .
I passed out in my backseat looking out at the ocean as that’s where I have grown up , and that’s what I wanted to look at last . I called my dad crying , I could hardly talk I could hardly see and I was to weak to stand up. Im not sure how I survived as my tolerance is extremely low at this point . But I did. I felt shame and embarrassment this morning , I wasn’t looking for attention . I just wanted my physical and mental pain to end.
But I’m not feeling shame tonight , I feel lucky to be alive, and thankful to those who care about me. Anyone contemplating suicide , ask someone to talk call a friend, fuck go to a hospital. I love you all , and I hope anyone going thru shit, will get thru it.
Peace and Love

Who wishes life had an off button?,I for sure do.
"Every night, I consider driving myself to the emergency room, and then every night I remind myself all that will do is give me another bill I can't afford to pay","There are really no good options when you don't have any money. Sure, I could call a suicide hotline, but all they would do is send the police to my house, who would arrest me and take me to the hospital. So super, then I'd have the traumatizing experience of being put in handcuffs for being depressed and a hospital bill I can't afford that would eventually be sent to collections and wreck my credit. I'd still be physically alive but still no closer to fixing my mental health and all of the awful life circumstances causing my depression in the first place.

I don't know what to do. I have no one and nothing. I had some things to look forward to about a year ago, but those fell apart, and now I have truly nothing. I know I'm not being specific, but I don't have the energy to type out a really long story, and it won't matter anyway. Truthfully the only argument I have against dying is that it would kill my dog if I was suddenly gone. Earlier today, she ran away, and while I was outside looking for her, the thought that kept running through my head is, ""What if she's dead. What if a car hit her or she went swimming in the creek and an alligator ate her? Then I'd truly have no reason left to be alive."" This is what my life has come to. Nonstop thoughts like this.

I want to go to a therapist so bad, but I can't afford it. Don't tell me that there are therapists who will reduce their fees or that there are free clinics. A) It doesn't matter how much the therapist reduces their fee if I have ZERO MONEY, and B) Free clinics do not exist in my area. At all. I've researched extensively, and they just aren't a thing. I say this because every time I've posted about my situation online in the past, I've gotten flooded with people telling me to go find a free clinic or to start calling up therapists and asking if they'll reduce their fees. It's exhausting to try to explain over and over again that those solutions don't work.

Okay, that's all. I had to say something somewhere, and Reddit is free at least."
"PSA: What's wrong with posting a general ""People care about you, please don't kill yourself"" message?","We've been seeing an increase in this type of submission at SW lately.  You may not have noticed, because we have removed most of them, but we've missed a couple and received some understandable complaints.

First of all, if you have been helped by seeing one of these messages at a critical time in your life, that is wonderful.  But if that's the case, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why, in our [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) we say: 

> Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering, and you can’t measure that from the outside.  **A message that** ***in any way*** **tries to tell or show the suicidal person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”.**  

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, simply seeing one of these message can make their sense of alienation and failure worse, because they are not remotely able to believe that it's true *for them*.  Anything  meant to be universally ""uplifting"", including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

We know that these posts come from people who truly want to help.  Perhaps they think that, if they only have time to write one message, they can do the most good by reaching out in a general way to many people.  That assumption is refuted by all the best experimental and clinical data that we have.  (Please see the references in the [talking tips post](http://redd.it/igh87) if you're interested in the details.)

If you only have time to write one message here, sort by ""New"" and pick an OP who doesn't have many good responses on their thread, and respond to them, directly and personally.  If you don't know what to say, that's what the [talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) are for!

You will still help many people!  A lot of our most distressed people lurk for a long time before posting, and what we hear from them over and over again is that what finally helped them get up the courage to post was seeing this type of empathetic and *individualized* response.  

Edit: typos, added the origin of ""It Gets Better"". 
"
It’s crushing to know that I’ll never be normal.,"I never got to live the normal childhood with non-abusive parents in a great home environment. 

Depression and anxiety have ruined me, and I know they’ll never go away. I’ll be like this forever, even if I did get it to a mild state.

 I’ll never get to make stupid mistakes and grow up, bc w every little mistake my parents scream at me and emotionally abuse me, so that’s always made me terrified to do anything that they think is wrong. They don’t let me grow. They never did. But my mental illness made me grow a lot faster a lot sooner. 

I’ll live with the knowledge that I tried to kill myself on March 21, 2020 and never got to tell anyone because they wouldn’t care. My parents would just say how disappointed they were about how I didn’t tell them earlier and be all petty and shit, but my friends would probably just brush it off and say “oh wow sorry” or something. I don’t want to burden them anyway. My parents have called me a burden to them multiple times.

Is that all I’ll ever be? A burden? Someone who has to pay another person in order to share their feelings, because no one else will listen?

I wish I could’ve just lived a normal fucking childhood. But it’s gone. It’s fucking gone and I can never get it back. I’m done"
I hate humanity so much.,"It's nothing but selfishness and double standards.

You can be complaining about the cruelness and unfairness of the world with someone who agrees and even contributes to the conversation, but the moment you hint at having suicidal ideations their mind suddenly shifts and they go from talking about how the world is awful to it being this beautiful place where you can find hope in any situation. People's minds just suddenly changing like that suggests that they don't truly believe in either. Why should I have faith in your forced words?

It's perfectly okay to strip people of their homes when they're financially struggling, and it's acceptable to shove someone into a corner with little to no solutions, but committing suicide? No, you're not allowed to stop your pain. ""If you're suicidal because of a lack of money, we'll hospitalize you, do jack shit to help you, and then charge an insane amount of money for it."" And when you're released you're expected to be completely fucking cured and to go back to being a mindless, content slave. ""If you don't like being a slave, then fuck you. You can starve, because we're not going to help you. You're not useful to society so you mean absolutely nothing to us. Oh, but... don't kill yourself, because we actually care."" 

Life is shitty from the very beginning. Even as a young kid you're forced to attend school for eight hours a day and have to deal with the stress of tests and exams that determine your classes and if you're able to move forward to the next grade. Fucking 9 year old kids shouldn't have to deal with that kind of pressure. It's incredibly unfair and even as a child I knew that the education system was/is bullshit. But if you don't finish school it just makes the rest of your life even harder. You're never given a break. After or even during school, you're expected to get a job. All of the time you could have had to yourself is just gone. You never have the chance to do anything *you* want to do anymore. People stay up later and get less sleep than they should just so they can have a few hours to themselves before they have to worry about their responsibilities again. And it's a cycle that is just supposed to continue until you're too old to do anything else with your life. It's depressing shit.

Why am I mentally ill for wanting to break out of that cycle? Why are people *not* considered mentally ill for seeing this lifestyle as normal and thinking that it's possible to be happy living like that? Call me weak, lazy, etc. But I just can not mentally or physically handle the responsibilities and stress of life. It's always been too much for me. The world and everyone in it is unbelievably cruel. Situations like the one we're dealing with now just put people's natural selfishness on full display; buying everything before anyone else can, leaving their homes for unimportant reasons, etc. No one cares about anything or anyone else other than themselves. I can't seriously believe anyone who says otherwise. The proof is all around you and it's impossible to ignore.

I'm tired of all of these bullshit ""solutions"". Hospitalizing me and trapping me in a psych ward isn't going to fucking help me. It's counterproductive as shit and is just further proof that medical ""professionals"" don't know anything and lack any sort of empathy. You have to be fucked up to think that locking multiple people with different issues and illnesses together is actually effective and will help anyone. I don't care about your hotline spam and cookie-cutter ""advice"" either. No, it doesn't get better. My life has only gotten harder, and will continue to do so. You don't know me or what I'm dealing with. Stop acting like you know all the solutions to my problems, as doing so just makes you come off as incredibly ignorant. 

I don't want help by pills being shoved down my throat or by countless therapists telling me the same things but worded slightly different. I want out. Out of this life before it can get worse. I'm tired of being a part of this sick game where everyone loses in the end. If you actually cared about me and my happiness and not your own, you'd give me the option of a peaceful rest."
"If it was 100% guaranteed I would die, I'd kill myself right now","The only reason I haven't is because I am afraid no matter what I do I'll survive it somehow. I read doctor's notes for a living, I see the failed attempts. Guns, knives, pills, whatever you could find to hang yourself- nothing is absolutely going to kill you 100% of the time. And with my luck, I know I'll be one of the ones who puts a bullet in their brain and comes out the other side with the mentality of a child. And I am not about to attempt to kill myself, survive unharmed, and deal with all that bullshit fallout.

It's just so fucking hard. All of it is. When I was in elementary school I would tell myself: ""Just make it to middle school and we'll get better.""
Middle school comes, ""Just make it to high school and we'll get better"" 
High school: ""Just make it to college and we'll be better."" College: ""Just graduate and get a job and we'll get better.""

And now I'm graduated and have a job, and I'm still not better. It doesn't get better. All of these things I've told myself over the years are lies. 

I hate myself. I hate my brain. I fucking hate living. I'm not a religious person, but I pray everyday that the cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs will start doing their jobs and finally fucking kill me. Suicide is a constant thought in my mind. It's the white noise of my brain. When I'm falling asleep, I'm thinking of taking my grandfather's gun out of the safe and finally ending it. I imagine it, everyday, all day. I can't remember the last time a day went by when I didn't.

You wanna know the worst part? My life isn't even that bad. I've never been abused or raped or anything traumatic like that. I have a mother who adores me. A husband who would do anything for me. A dog, who has been my best friend for the past 13 years. I make decent money and don't live an extravagant lifestyle or have kids, so I'm not broke. I'm just a gal who's brain is fucked and can't even call a doctor to schedule an appointment without having a goddamn panic attack. It's pathetic, sickening, and a disgrace to the people who actually deal with real problems.

I just really needed to rant. Sorry."
I deleted my suicide note,Was updating once a year for like 10 years. Baby steps I guess.
I did it.,"After 4 years and 2 weeks of crippling suicidal thoughts, I called to make an appointment for an initial consultation at my university's clinical services. I'm scared for tomorrow, but it's the only thing I'm holding on to at this point

*** Oh wow, the support is overwhelming. Thank you so much, everyone. I'll update again tomorrow after the appointment."
Tried to overdose when i was 19 after breaking up with girlfriend - now 55 and happily married with 2 kids - I'm so glad i didn't die.,"I was certain and i mean 100% certain that i had no reason to live at the age of 19.  I had lost the love of my life and i knew that life would be pointless without her.

But i was wrong.  Ten years later i met the most wonderful woman and have had a great life the last 35 years.  I look back and i am so glad i didn't die, didn't miss the life i have had, didn't hurt my mother who would have been totally crushed if i had succeeded.

You don't know what the future holds.  Things can get better.  

  "
What if I'm already in hell?,That's why my life is so miserable and I can never succeed in killing myself. And the little bit of joy there is in my life is put there to make the suffering all the more painful...
"I'm not strong enough to keep doing this, I need help.","## I know I'm far from the biggest victim of the universe, there's plenty of people that have it far worse than me. I really need to get this off my chest because it's a burden I've been holding for a while and I just no longer know what to do.

I know y'all are busy, so I've decided to put all my grievances in a list, also if you're extra busy I decided to highlight all of the key points:

1. **I feel so lonely**, I've never had a group of friends that I could constantly reach, this has been my life since I was a child. There's plenty of people that know me and people that I can interact with, I'm not an unlikable person but there's no one I have any close connection with, we're just not simply on the same channel. Despite this there're people that do talk to me and I've been ghosting most of these people because quite frankly I don't want to make their experiences worse with having them around me.
2. **I have no drive to continue doing anything**, there's literally nothing motivating to do anything. Simple things like driving a car to be wash, showering daily, brushing my teeth, getting out of bed, etc. are difficult to do. My bedroom has been disorganized since december 2018, I feel really guilty about it.
3. In my search for love this past year, I was greatly disappointed with **my first boyfriend, who apparently left me for his ex.** This has made me feel terrible inside, specially because when I began dating him I told everyone about him, I even told my family. He lied about having an illness and he dumped me because he that he didn't want for me to him deteriorate, months later I texted to check up on him and he told me he was back with his ex and he also told me to stop ""obsessing over him"" and blocked my number that very same day. **I was so embarrassed I didn't told anyone what happened.**
4. I've had a **lot of meaningless sex** since he dumped me, but on the inside nothing really fills me up. **I don't even have any pleasure having sex** or have sex with guys I would particularly find attractive, however I don't know why I keep doing this.
5. **I have a severe distrust of people** because many of my close friends and the guy mentioned on point number three have made me extremely distrustful of people, it seems every person I think it's a good reliable friend ends up hurting me the most. It seems that for people I'm an acceptable target to abuse.
6. I often feel **my ""friends"" just contact me because they need something**, not because they actually want to talk to me.
7. **I constantly have suicidal thoughts**, I don't want to be here anymore and I don't understand what's the point of keeping on because I know that every time things get better from me, they don't last. Often times I could be walking near a bridge and in my head I start thinking on how can I ended it all by jumping. I've tried suicide before but no serious attempt recently.
8. **It's hard for me to focus on anything**, it's been getting worse lately, for example I can't open a tab with a YouTube video because I immediately change it.
9. For the last year I've developed a horrible **habit of compulsive spending** shit I don't need, despite all my life being someone that saves money I'm spending it all. I've even spent all my savings from 2016 - 2017 and I feel extremely guilty about it.
10. Last year I've developed a really serious habit of **binging junk food**, like literally spending serious money on junk food to eat in one sitting. For example, this week I've consumed at least 20 cans of coke.
11. I'm extremely **distrustful of people criticizing my job**, I don't like a lot what I do and every time I show someone my work for critiques, I'm mostly met with good critiques, but I feel like they're lying to me. For some reason, deep inside me, I know they're just saying that to be nice and not because they actually mean it.
12. **I have a** **severe problem with perfectionism** and it has made my life worse. Ever since I was little I do things like **compulsively ripping pages of my notebooks every time I dislike the way I'm writing.** This happens in every other aspect of my life. For example, if I don't like how I'm drawing, I rip the drawing into shreds and start again, if I don't like how my phone is organized I delete all the data and I try to reorganize it again, etc.
13. **I have no will power to do anything**, not to start projects or to finish them.
14. Lastly, **I feel ugly as fuck**, I have always felt horrible towards my personal appearance, but lately I know I look like a hot mess.

I feel in a state of emergency because this time I have really lost the will of doing anything about my situation, it's like a train is going to run over me but I can't possibly move because I don't know what to do. I've been to therapists, psychiatrists and psychologists before but I feel really weak right now and I don't know if I can hold to months of talking with a person of debilitating issues I have, so maybe they can finally tell me if I have something. I'm desperate because I need a fix for all of this things, I'm deeply concerned with not getting out of this.

&#x200B;

What is your experience what has worked for y'all?"
Stop assuming we have people who care about us,"It's so annoying to here the ""think about the people who care about you"" line. A lot of us don't have those people. This isn't me being mellow dramatic or delusional, this is just my life. It also implies that youre life is only worth living because other people care about you, which is bullshit even if you do have people who care about you.

I can't make a list if all the annoying shit people say to suicidal people but this is by far the worst because they make assumptions about your life. People don't realize the privilege of having friends and a loving family so they assume we all do. "
I tell myself that I am meant to kill myself the same way a person is meant to be an actor or a lawyer or a doctor.,"It just makes sense that someone with no real skills no purpose no commitments no relationships to maintain should just die. 

I feel like this debilitating depression is nature's way of saying 'you are not needed.' Like natural selection in real time. 

I sometimes sleep with a belt around my neck tightened just enough that I might shift into a bad position and cut off the blood flow to my brain. 

Just seems like it's meant to be for me."
