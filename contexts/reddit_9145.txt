Greetings fellow poors. I wanted to compile a list of reddit resources I've found that can hopefully help at least someone.
If anything, I just hope someone appreciates the time I spent formatting. <3

Edit: Whoooo boy, I did not expect this kind of response but I am SO happy about it. Thank you all so much for your kind words, I am truly touched by the amount of people saying this list has helped them. I will continue to add on and update this as I am able. And of course, thanks for the gold and silver! If only it were real money ^*cries* ^*in* ^*poor*. I know a lot of you are struggling, just know that you are not alone, there is help out there, and people DO care about you. In the popular words of the all wonderful Mister Rogers, 

"When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, "Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping." To this day, especially in times of "disaster," I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers – so many caring people in this world."

**Other Helpful Tips**

* If you are homeless, try to scrape together some money for a $10 gym membership to Planet Fitness if you can. That's at least one month of a place where you have access to free bathrooms and showers.

* /u/RUfuqingkiddingme would like to remind you that if you are in the US, you can dial 211 to be connected to your local resources!

* Don't forget to also find your local town/city/state/neighboring cities subreddits! There are redditors everywhere that can help you/that are giving away things, and these will be more knowledgeable about local resources as well.

* In my time working for Starbucks, I learned that a LOT of pastries get thrown out at the end of every day, as well as the lunch boxes and sandwiches that expire the next day. I would bring BAGS full of food to some of the homeless near my old apartment. Go to your local Starbucks in the evening when it's slow and ask an employee if they would be allowed to give you any of these things, I'm sure they wouldn't mind. If they say no, please be courteous and polite to them as it's likely not their fault and more of a management decision at that facility.
